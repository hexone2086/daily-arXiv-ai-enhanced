Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入真实环境，通过视觉上微小的修改将任意图像转换为可打印的隐形标记，用于6自由度位置追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学上过于显眼，在某些应用场景中不受欢迎，需要开发能够隐蔽地融入环境的追踪标记。

Method: 采用端到端的深度隐写方法，联合训练编码器网络将图像转换为Ninja Codes，以及检测网络识别这些标记，使用普通彩色打印机在常规打印纸上制作。

Result: 实验表明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在各种环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在需要隐蔽追踪的场景中具有特殊价值，特别是在传统标记因外观显眼而不适用的美学敏感环境中。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了高级感知、预测和规划问题的回答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的问答挑战，利用预训练视觉语言模型提升驾驶场景理解能力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM结合六摄像头输入、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增强场景元数据和任务特定指令，并应用自一致性集成提高可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著超越基线模型，第一阶段准确率达65.1%，自一致性提升至66.85%，第二阶段达67.37%，在严重视觉干扰下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示工程和上下文增强可以极大提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，用于解决纵向医学图像分析中高分辨率图像序列在非均匀时间间隔下的建模挑战，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纵向放射学图像分析中的基本数据挑战：如何有效建模在非均匀时间间隔捕获的高分辨率图像序列，充分利用其空间和时间线索。

Method: 采用状态空间架构，核心创新是连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差整合到状态转换中，并辅以多尺度3D邻域融合模块来捕捉时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中表现优异，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架，得益于其线性复杂度。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间来改进文本到视频扩散模型，使其生成更符合物理常识的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间连贯和物理合理的运动方面存在困难，主要原因是模型对复杂运动理解不足。现有方法通过对齐扩散模型特征与预训练视频编码器特征来改进，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态，限制了改进效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架，从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化以确保捕获真实运动动态。然后将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试以及用户研究中表现出色，显著提升了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持了与文本提示的契合度。

Conclusion: 通过解耦运动子空间的对齐方法有效提升了文本到视频扩散模型的运动生成质量，使其生成更符合物理常识的视频内容。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，它使用场景图作为结构化指导，通过LLM作为评判者来生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。该方法在DOCENT数据集上比现有指标更好地与人类评分相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本中的属性和关系错误。需要一种能够定位特定文本跨度错误的新评估方法。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化指导，引导LLM作为评判者，生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。同时引入了DOCENT数据集，包含艺术作品和专家编写的参考描述。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类判断的相关性比最佳开源替代方案强0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且能够作为有效的奖励函数。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为详细图像描述评估提供了新的基准，揭示了基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时面临的挑战，为VLM进展设定了新的严格任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR是一个统一的人体姿态表示学习框架，通过新颖的基于奇异值的对比学习损失，对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对不同模态人体姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究，特别是在对比学习范式下。人体姿态表示在人体中心应用中至关重要，需要统一的表示框架来支持多模态融合和生成。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失来同时对齐多个数据表示，包括图像、2D和3D人体姿态。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm（跨域评估）。在Human3.6M数据集上实现2D和3D姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm MPJPE。

Conclusion: UniHPR通过统一表示学习有效对齐了不同模态的人体姿态嵌入，在姿态估计和检索任务中表现出色，证明了多模态对齐的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在脑肿瘤分割中面临挑战：难以准确描绘不规则形状和模糊边界，处理高分辨率MRI数据需要大量计算资源，且存在类别不平衡问题。

Method: 在3D U-Net模型中集成注意力机制，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并优先处理信息丰富的区域；使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据，结合改进的U-Net注意力机制模型，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。超声成像作为可靠且经济有效的工具面临医疗数据敏感性挑战，联邦学习能保护隐私但非独立同分布数据会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布超声乳腺癌数据集，结合改进的U-Net模型并加入注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 该方法训练出的全局模型达到了96%的准确率，有效提升了肿瘤分割精度同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和跨自我对比学习方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，特别是在电子竞技中的团队战术学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究大多依赖第三人称视角，忽略了多智能体学习的同步自我中心特性。需要从每个玩家的第一人称视角来理解团队战术的涌现。

Method: 构建了X-Ego-CS数据集，包含45场专业级《反恐精英2》比赛的124小时游戏录像，提供同步的第一人称视角视频流和状态-动作轨迹。提出了跨自我对比学习方法，通过对齐队友的自我中心视觉流来培养团队层面的战术情境意识。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台，对时空推理和人类-AI协作具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文使用六种深度卷积网络对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%，证明了深度学习在疟疾自动诊断中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疟疾诊断依赖专家人工观察血涂片图像，存在专业知识不足和人为错误风险，需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统来提高准确性和效率。

Method: 应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深度特征并进行分类。

Result: 在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上，残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最优，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，超越了其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的自动检测方法能够可靠地识别疟疾感染细胞，显著减少人工参与，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将令牌修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到不同解码策略中，展现了方法的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务中的时序不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的微调方法主要关注整体视频质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中时序一致性往往受到影响，需要专门针对时序一致性的优化方法。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频域空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧间信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不降低其他性能指标。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性增强方法，能够在不牺牲其他质量指标的前提下改善视频生成模型的时序连贯性。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强自动驾驶下游感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升角案例感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽略了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务的评估。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练轮次翻倍，当基线方法也使用双倍轮次时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: 该框架能够大规模生成多视角角案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的角案例感知能力。实验表明Dream4Drive在各种训练轮次下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Dream4Drive提供了一个灵活生成大规模多视角角案例的框架，并贡献了DriveObj3D大规模3D资产数据集，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: 提出了MoE-GS框架，将混合专家技术首次引入动态高斯泼溅，通过体积感知像素路由器自适应融合多个专家输出，提升渲染质量，并通过效率优化和蒸馏策略解决模型容量增加的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，没有单一方法能有效处理所有动态挑战，需要更统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出MoE-GS框架，集成多个专业专家，通过体积感知像素路由器将体积高斯级权重投影到像素空间进行自适应融合；采用单次多专家渲染、门感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略来提升效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在保持效率的同时，持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术引入动态高斯泼溅的方法，通过专家集成和效率优化策略，实现了更好的渲染质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达检测网络，通过估计物体二次表面参数来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏问题，在BEV空间实现多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和精确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示并阻碍多模态融合。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次表面参数，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达稀疏性；使用预测深度将图像特征从透视视图转换到BEV空间；采用基于pillar的方法处理点云分支，最终使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行预测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft (VoD)物体检测基准测试中表现出优越性能，有效融合了相机和4D雷达特征。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合指导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D成像雷达稀疏性问题，提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过小波变换特征增强和基于匈牙利算法的多帧轨迹补全，有效解决了GEO空间目标的检测难题，在复杂背景下实现了高精度的目标检测。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个前景中心的协作感知框架，通过将背景上下文信息压缩到前景特征中，在带宽受限的车载网络中实现高效的协作感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车载网络带宽限制下协作感知的挑战，传统方法丢弃背景信息导致上下文缺失，需要找到在传输前景特征的同时保留背景上下文的方法。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而无需传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法，证明了上下文丰富的前景共享的有效性。

Conclusion: FadeLead通过将背景上下文压缩到前景特征中，成功克服了带宽限制下的协作感知挑战，为长尾场景提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Result: 在三个自收集数据集上平均识别精度达92.12%，仅消耗136.16 pJ能量，处理速度为8.84动作/秒，解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Conclusion: MobiAct实现了低能耗、低计算的MAV动作识别，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了效率，适合资源受限的MAV平台。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Result: 在SDXL-Turbo、SD-Turbo和Pixart-DMD等多个模型上，在四个不同复杂度的基准测试中（低密度、高密度和多对象场景）都取得了显著改进，对象计数准确率最高提升13.7%。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将不可微的检测器转换为可微的批评器，显著提高了文本到图像模型的计数能力，同时保持了图像质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and

*Zhida Zhao,Talas Fu,Yifan Wang,Lijun Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Policy World Model (PWM)的新驾驶范式，将世界建模和轨迹规划统一在一个架构中，通过无动作的未来状态预测方案利用学习的世界知识来提升规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前驾驶世界模型主要用于世界模拟，与轨迹规划分离，虽然近期有研究尝试统一世界建模和规划，但世界建模对规划的协同促进机制仍需进一步探索。

Method: PWM通过协作的状态-动作预测实现类人的预期感知，采用动态增强的并行令牌生成机制，配备上下文引导的令牌器和自适应动态焦点损失来提高视频预测效率。

Result: 尽管仅使用前视摄像头输入，该方法在性能上匹配或超过了依赖多视角和多模态输入的最先进方法。

Conclusion: PWM不仅统一了世界建模和轨迹规划，还能通过学习的知识提升规划可靠性，展示了世界建模与规划协同的有效性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Motivation: 手写签名验证在身份认证中至关重要，但由于用户内部变异性和伪造风险，实现高精度验证仍然具有挑战性。

Method: TS-GATR将签名表示为图，节点捕获动态特征，使用注意力机制建模复杂关系。采用双图注意力变换器模块分别建模局部和全局空间特征，并集成GRU捕获长期时间依赖。

Result: 在MSDS和DeepSignDB等基准数据集上的实验表明，TS-GATR超越了当前最优方法，在各种场景下均实现了更低的等错误率。

Conclusion: TS-GATR通过有效建模签名的时空特征，显著提升了动态签名验证的性能。

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深测量和基于像素的海底分类，解决了现有方法将这两个任务孤立处理的问题，实现了协同增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将水深测量和海底分类任务分开处理，丧失了它们之间的相互促进作用，限制了深度学习方法在浅水环境测绘中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权来平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质性海岸站点的广泛评估中，相比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法，RMSE降低了75%；与最先进的单任务和多任务基线相比，水深RMSE降低了10-30%，海底分类准确率提高了8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模深度与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了一个稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Result: 实验表明现有算法在尺度偏移问题上存在局限性，提出的Catto算法能有效缓解尺度偏移影响，并揭示了四个重要研究见解。

Conclusion: 尺度偏移领域泛化是一个重要且实用的研究方向，需要更多关注和研究。

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需单独的VAE管道即可实现竞争性图像重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，并添加参数密集的VAE管道来捕获视觉细节，但这忽视了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统的功能层次结构，将不同功能视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号对齐到对应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入交叉重建策略和多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越SOTA方法，包括使用VAE管道的方法，同时参数数量减少71.7%，有效捕获了CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP通过利用CLIP中间特征，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道，实现了参数高效的fMRI图像解码。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Motivation: 解决传统方法需要大量标注数据和预定义类别限制的问题，实现无需训练的开集词汇图像分割与识别。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2) 利用CLIP的视觉和文本编码器进行跨模态对齐，通过相似度计算实现开集识别。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在无需训练的情况下实现高效、灵活和可泛化的开集词汇图像分割与识别的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型作为移动手机代理的基础，在处理多任务时性能有限，现有方法难以确定最优的训练数据组合以获得最佳性能。

Method: 使用可训练网络预测任何给定数据集比例下的下游任务性能，从而确定最优的数据混合配置。

Result: 在PhoneAgentBench基准测试中性能提升3.38%，在多个基准测试中平均得分提升2.57%，在BFCL-v3任务上指标提升12.47%。

Conclusion: DaMo能有效优化多任务学习中的数据混合，具有强大的预测能力和良好的泛化性，且能扩展到其他模型架构。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像配准中忽视了正则化的重要性，导致缺乏鲁棒性和解剖学合理性。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，整合应变和剪切能量项，并包含折叠预防机制惩罚负变形雅可比区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影如折叠，避免过度平滑，提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE通过自适应正则化策略在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: AegisRF通过注入对抗性扰动来保护NeRF模型的知识产权，同时使用可学习的敏感度场来约束几何扰动，保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的强大工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得日益重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间，因为这会破坏场景结构。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场（在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗扰动）和敏感度场（学习空间变化的敏感度来自适应约束几何扰动）。

Result: 实验证明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF有效保护NeRF模型的知识产权，在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权的使用。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数视觉语言模型评估都集中在单视角设置上，而多摄像头配置在机器人平台中越来越普遍，但VLM是否能有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 构建MV-RoboBench基准测试，包含8个子任务的1.7k个QA项目，评估包括开源和闭源模型在内的多种VLM，并采用CoT启发技术增强版本。

Result: 最先进的模型表现远低于人类水平，揭示了VLM在多视角机器人感知中面临的重大挑战。空间智能与机器人任务执行在多视角场景中呈正相关，但现有单视角基准测试的强性能不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench作为开放资源发布，旨在促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，提供数据和标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: MLLMs在客观多模态感知任务中表现出色，但在主观、情感细腻的心理分析领域应用不足。

Method: 将包含多个实例的绘图分解为语义子图，构建层次表示；分析各层次子图提取心理洞察；引入HTP知识库和特征提取模块生成心理档案；整合多方面信息生成评估。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了MLLMs与专业领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化、可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，能够生成具有精确控制属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决了地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取真正代表整体地层属性的孔隙尺度图像是地下表征的基本挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，且物理样本仅在稀疏井位可用。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的四个深度薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数作为条件输入，捕捉通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了出色的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197。生成的图像显示优于真实子图像的代表性，双重约束误差为1.9-11.3%，而随机提取的真实子图像为36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI加速范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提高高加速因子下的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床吞吐量，需要新的方法来加速MRI扫描过程。

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，然后重建高度欠采样的数据。模型可基于多种数据源进行条件预测，包括其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数和患者信息。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，该方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本转变，为MRI加速提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: PRGCN通过跨序列模式重用解决单目3D人体姿态估计问题，使用图记忆库存储姿态原型，结合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力机制，在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP上达到SOTA性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理孤立序列，未能利用跨序列的结构规律和重复运动模式，限制了3D姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库存储姿态原型，通过注意力机制检索并融合解剖约束，采用双流混合架构结合Mamba和自注意力。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP上分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，展现了优越的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动领域发展至关重要，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提出重采样和插补方法来解决甲烷羽流检测中标签与覆盖率之间的虚假关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像因云层等因素存在系统性缺失像素，如果不处理这些缺失数据，会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型可能错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联起来。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 重采样和插补方法都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中，去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏技术能有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Motivation: 当前主流方法通过数据增强缓解域差异，但由于域偏移和有限域知识，模型容易陷入伪相关陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征而非本质的域不变表示。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1) 跨注意力提示模块，通过视觉提示与跨注意力集成减轻伪特征偏差；2) 双分支适配器，通过高频特征提取实现域适应，同时分离因果-伪特征。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上，Cauvis相比现有域泛化方法获得15.9-31.4%的性能提升，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，通过因果视觉提示实现了更好的域泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉token占总token的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够完成任务。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应何时收敛到其正确回答能力的峰值，训练为离散分类器但推理时可插值连续分辨率进行细粒度控制。

Result: 在五个涵盖文档和自然图像的多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时，计算量减少了高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的高计算成本问题，实现了计算效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时效果不佳，基于视频插值的方法生成帧模糊且选择策略效率低，需要更清晰的中介帧和更有效的选择机制

Method: 提出混合视频生成(HVG)结合视频插值和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中介帧，使用基于特征匹配的选择器(FMS)选择适合姿态估计的帧

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了姿态估计性能，特别是在小重叠或无重叠情况下

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过混合视频生成和特征匹配选择器有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机姿态估计挑战，为小重叠场景提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Method: 研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型在计数任务中的推理能力，进行受控实验分析，包括层间分析，并采用针对性训练方法仅微调输出层。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。层间分析显示错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可使准确率提升高达21%，并在真实数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在计数任务中的失败主要源于输出映射问题，通过针对性微调输出层可显著提升性能，这为改进模型推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具备时间感知能力，时间信息在其嵌入空间中具有结构化特征，通过构建时间线表示可以有效支持时间推理任务。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势：RGB相机提供高空间分辨率和纹理细节，事件相机提供高时间分辨率和动态范围。但两者成像机制不同导致显著的时空不对称，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 提出分层不对称蒸馏(HAD)框架，采用分层对齐策略，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，为多模态目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着物体检测模型在自动驾驶汽车等网络物理系统中的部署增加，确保其对抗威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域的攻击，而视频域的攻击，特别是在无盒设置下的攻击，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道，设计融合算法将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性。攻击无需访问模型架构、参数或输出，且不引入可察觉的伪影。

Result: 在五个最先进的物体检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型上评估，在所有场景中实现了100%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中一个先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗环境中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫需求。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: VGD通过显式几何学习和特征一致性学习，成功解决了环绕视角场景重建中的几何一致性与新视角质量提升的平衡问题。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Method: 结合对比学习和模态判别学习，引导单模态模型将内部表征结构化为模态共享和模态特定信息，实现跨任务泛化。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical

and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将视频理解模型的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频对象分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现强劲，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与对象区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来改进注意力图以实现精确分割。

Method: 使用分解注意力融合机制，包括对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频帧融合，抑制无关激活并增强对象焦点线索，将注意力图转换为粗分割掩码，再结合注意力引导的SAM2提示获得精细掩码。

Result: DecAF在无需训练的方法中表现优异，在参考和推理视频对象分割基准测试中达到与训练方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需训练的视频对象分割，通过改进注意力图质量，为多模态大语言模型在视频分割任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样化的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可靠性和准确性，解决了现有方法单一确定性预测的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法通常生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，难以满足法医分析和安全监控等高要求应用的需求。

Method: 引入条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，在扩散过程中加入伯努利噪声以更好反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，并设计时间步交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)来利用语义特征和时间步信息。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法，展现出强大的实际部署潜力。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个多样化定位图有效解决了伪造区域的不确定性和变异性问题，提高了预测的可信度，为图像伪造定位任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸片X光中视觉语言模型的跨模态可解释性，发现当前模型在临床可靠定位方面仍有不足，特别是在小病灶或弥散性病变上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中展现出卓越的零样本性能，但其定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索。在医学领域，可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多种病理上的对齐程度，评估了七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体。

Result: 发现：(1)所有模型变体在大而明确的病理上表现合理，但在小或弥散性病变上性能显著下降；(2)在胸片X光特定数据集上预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型对齐效果更好；(3)模型的整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管具备强大的识别能力，但在临床可靠定位方面仍有不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来捕获图像几何规律性，在数值实验中达到了卡通图像的最小化渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在框架中无法充分适应复杂信号规律性，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2且未知时，小波、曲波等框架都是次优的。深度卷积神经网络虽然取得了更好的数值结果，但需要更简化的模型。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过第二次小波变换计算小波系数模的变换。提出去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来捕获图像几何规律性。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都达到了最小化渐近界。证明了这些ℓ¹范数能够捕获不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种不同的谐波分析方法来抑制信号噪声并指定函数的几何规律性，在谐波分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Conclusion: GenComm通过生成通信机制有效解决了异构多智能体协作中的领域差距问题，实现了高效且可扩展的感知增强。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法面临数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间边界模糊、以及细粒度语义区分不足三个关键瓶颈

Method: 提出AMR框架，包含两阶段训练：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入原始查询和主动查询双查询集，通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比先前最先进方法实现了性能提升

Conclusion: AMR框架有效解决了时刻检索中的数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义区分问题，无需额外数据标注即可显著提升模型性能

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式推理过程和强化学习，显著提升了医学视觉语言模型的诊断性能

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在复杂场景中会出现过重构伪影（局部模糊和针状扭曲），现有方法归因于大规模高斯分裂不足，但本文发现根本原因是梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法：1）重要性感知致密化准则，结合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的基元增长；2）重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多样化真实数据集上的实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重构伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持了精细的几何细节。

Conclusion: 重新激活机制在与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）集成时也能带来一致改进，证明了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

*Zihao Chen,Yi Zhou,Xudong Jiang,Li Chen,Leopold Schmetterer,Bingyao Tan,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CST是一个用于医学图像无配对跨模态转换的框架，通过集成曲线结构提取模块来保持细小的曲线结构（如微血管），提高转换保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像转换方法在医学成像中会扭曲细小的曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，特别是在眼科和血管成像中这些细微形态变化具有重要临床意义。

Method: CST框架在基线模型基础上增加曲线结构提取模块进行拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法中。作者将其集成到CycleGAN和UNSB两个代表性骨干网络中。

Result: 在三种成像模态（OCT血管造影、彩色眼底和X射线冠脉造影）上的综合评估表明，CST提高了转换保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST通过强化学习映射中的几何完整性，为医学成像中的曲线结构感知跨域转换建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

*Rashik Shadman,M G Sarwar Murshed,Faraz Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术，为基于深度学习的活体检测系统提供视觉解释，提高系统透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习活体检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解模型行为，特别是视觉解释对于确定生物特征图像被判定为真实或伪造的关键区域至关重要。

Method: 提出了Ensemble-CAM技术，用于为基于深度学习的面部活体检测系统提供视觉解释。

Result: 该方法能够提供详细的视觉解释，帮助理解深度学习活体检测系统的决策过程。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够增强基于深度学习的面部活体检测系统的透明度和可信度，通过视觉解释更好地理解模型行为。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和Lyapunov稳定性正则化，从高维视频中提取物理可解释的动态系统变量，抑制背景运动等干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量具有挑战性，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰视觉因素。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关性分析选择物理意义维度，并用Lyapunov稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和纯变换器基线中达到最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生不仅准确而且物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出ADQ自适应量化框架，解决激活值分布不均和权重量化码本不匹配问题，在ImageNet上ResNet-18仅用2.81位平均位宽达到71.512%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法面临激活值分布高度不均匀和权重量化码本静态不匹配两大挑战

Method: 自适应权重量化方案：分位数初始化码本、EMA在线码本适应、敏感度指导的混合精度分配；激活值采用硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射

Result: ImageNet上ResNet-18仅用2.81位平均位宽达到71.512% Top-1准确率，优于同类方法；CIFAR-10消融实验验证各组件有效性

Conclusion: ADQ框架通过自适应分布感知量化有效解决了现有量化方法的局限性，在保持高精度的同时显著降低位宽

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多模态人体运动生成框架，使用自回归扩散变换器统一处理文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，支持时空控制和任务组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以统一处理多样化的多模态人体运动生成任务，缺乏对内容一致性、风格和时间动态的有效控制，需要构建大规模标准化数据集。

Method: 提出参考运动作为条件信号增强生成一致性，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，构建OmniMoCap-X数据集并使用GPT-4o自动生成结构化标注。

Result: 实验证明OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现最先进性能，能够交互式生成真实、连贯且可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X通过统一框架和高质量数据集成功解决了多模态人体运动生成的挑战，为现实动画应用提供了强大工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CPL-NC框架，通过类别感知原型缓存和负对比学习机制，解决视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的测试时适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移时性能下降，现有测试时适应方法忽略了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类别的混淆问题。

Method: 使用类别感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，结合负对比学习机制约束困难负样本，采用非对称优化仅更新文本原型。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是一个轻量级框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型的文本引导图像编辑能力显著提升，但研究进展受限于缺乏大规模、高质量、开放可用的真实图像数据集。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages真实照片生成多样化编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保编辑类型全面覆盖，通过MLLM质量评分和精心筛选保证内容保持和指令忠实度。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和评估下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了大规模、高质量、任务丰富的资源基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Motivation: 单目深度估计领域缺乏标准化的评估方法，现有评估指标的选择多样且其权衡和行为未被充分理解，需要系统分析指标性能并与人类判断进行比较。

Method: 通过定量分析现有指标对地面真值各种扰动的敏感性，特别关注与人类判断的对比，并开发基于相对表面法线的新指标、深度可视化工具和组合指标构建方法。

Result: 分析发现现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感，新提出的相对表面法线指标能更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 需要改进深度估计评估指标以更好地反映人类感知，相对表面法线指标和组合指标方法为解决现有指标的局限性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking

Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,

Conclusion: 该框架为月球探索提供了基于本体感知的地形测绘解决方案，能够评估地形对机器人运动的影响，支持在复杂环境中的自主导航。

Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for
future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve
geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged
robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data,
and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped
with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can
capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify
its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by
proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped
robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability
margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are
incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain
interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a
simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot
Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain
conditions.

Abstract: In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs,
has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a
standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor
propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the
visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to
acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best,
spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising
from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that
purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics
between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response
in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and
SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other
geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our
assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent
spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in
datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights
remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other
acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and
shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite
major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range
sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for
underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D
sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called
SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D
Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater
autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline
exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite
of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the
novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,
SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from
non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to
application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with
real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and
local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed
approach in full are planned in the very near future.

Conclusion: ∇-SDF为机器人和计算机视觉中的下游任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，在效率、精度和可微性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 针对四轮独立转向驱动系统（4WIS）的运动规划与控制研究，该系统受机械约束限制无法实现全360度转向。论文提出了考虑转向约束的数学公式和速度空间分区方法，设计了能够处理不连续性的运动规划器和控制器。

Motivation: 四轮独立转向驱动系统（4WIS）的配置空间存在约束和不连续性，影响机器人运动的平滑性。需要开发能够明确考虑转向约束和速度过渡平滑性的运动规划与控制方法。

Result: 将提出的运动规划器实现为ROS导航包的扩展，并在仿真和物理机器人上进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理4WIS系统的转向约束和不连续性问题，实现平滑高效的运动规划与控制。

Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel
drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints
prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The
configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities
that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that
partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We
further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance
that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition
smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation
from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing
by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement
the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and
evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance
remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated
forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of
satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for
efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an
algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term
conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a
convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate
empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of
globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation
produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of
collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability
of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty,
yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a
high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a
simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing collision risk.

Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by
the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control
strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which
impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this
study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model
Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist
integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is
formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending
deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from
deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online
adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s.
Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE
of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and
settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the
controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic
systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in
wearable assistive devices.

Conclusion: 基于采样的混合模式控制方法在机器人相关任务中表现出色，能够处理复杂的模式切换和复合行为。

Abstract: This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control
problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach
reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization
problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and
the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation
is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We
find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied
to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to
synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve
challenging tasks. Last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
real-world robotic examples that require reactive switching between long-term
planning and high-frequency control.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics and autonomous systems have broadened the use of
robots in laboratory settings, including automated synthesis, scalable reaction
workflows, and collaborative tasks in self-driving laboratories (SDLs). This
paper presents a comprehensive development of a mobile manipulator designed to
assist human operators in such autonomous lab environments. Kinematic modeling
of the manipulator is carried out based on the Denavit Hartenberg (DH)
convention and inverse kinematics solution is determined to enable precise and
adaptive manipulation capabilities. A key focus of this research is enhancing
the manipulator ability to reliably grasp textured objects as a critical
component of autonomous handling tasks. Advanced vision-based algorithms are
implemented to perform real-time object detection and pose estimation, guiding
the manipulator in dynamic grasping and following tasks. In this work, we
integrate a vision method that combines feature-based detection with
homography-driven pose estimation, leveraging depth information to represent an
object pose as a $2$D planar projection within $3$D space. This adaptive
capability enables the system to accommodate variations in object orientation
and supports robust autonomous manipulation across diverse environments. By
enabling autonomous experimentation and human-robot collaboration, this work
contributes to the scalability and reproducibility of next-generation chemical
laboratories

Abstract: Legged robots can sense terrain through force interactions during locomotion,
offering more reliable traversability estimates than remote sensing and serving
as scouts for guiding wheeled rovers in challenging environments. However, even
legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable
terrain. We present Safe Active Exploration for Granular Terrain (SAEGT), a
navigation framework that enables legged robots to safely explore unknown
granular environments using proprioceptive sensing, particularly where visual
input fails to capture terrain deformability. SAEGT estimates the safe region
and frontier region online from leg-terrain interactions using Gaussian Process
regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for
real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to
safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively
estimated traversability in simulation.

Conclusion: GADGET框架能够有效解决高维杂乱环境中的路径规划问题，具有优秀的泛化能力和安全性，在真实物理执行中表现良好。

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments
needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and
hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive
parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize
effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning
framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic
manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable
and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a
diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories
conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal
configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism
that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with
classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating
environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the
denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments
and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that
GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in
spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance
further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong
performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.
Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3
(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates
its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world
settings.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

Conclusion: 这些贡献为更灵活和自主的实验室自动化提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
laboratory automation. More information is available at

Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream
traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured,
off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual
uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially
independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of
3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we
introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially
correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic
world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics
engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured
convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate
predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a
publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation
and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation
baselines.

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA

transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

TL;DR: 提出使用离线强化学习来利用非专家数据增强模仿学习性能的方法，通过简单的算法修改显著提高了策略的恢复能力和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习依赖高质量专家数据，限制了在真实世界多样化场景中的适应性。非专家数据（如游戏数据、次优演示等）具有更广覆盖和更低收集成本，但传统模仿学习方法无法有效利用。

Method: 采用离线强化学习作为工具来利用非专家数据，通过扩大策略分布的支持范围，使模仿学习算法能够更稳健地解决任务。

Result: 在操作任务中，该方法显著增加了学习策略成功的初始条件范围，能够利用所有收集的数据（包括部分或次优演示）来提升任务导向策略性能。

Conclusion: 算法技术对于在机器人学中利用非专家数据进行稳健策略学习具有重要意义，离线强化学习可以有效地增强模仿学习策略的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform
complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and
biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent
prosthetic systems.

TL;DR: LaViRA是一个零样本视觉语言导航框架，通过语言-视觉-机器人动作的层次化分解，在未见环境中实现高效导航，显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本视觉语言导航中的关键权衡：要么依赖环境特定的路径点预测器限制场景泛化，要么在导航中未充分利用大模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出LaViRA框架，将动作分解为语言动作（高层规划）、视觉动作（感知接地）和机器人动作（鲁棒导航）的层次结构，利用不同规模多模态大语言模型的优势。

Result: 在VLN-CE基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，在未见环境中展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LaViRA通过模块化分解实现了强大的推理、接地和实际控制能力，同时保持透明度和效率，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language
instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical
trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit
scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large
models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot
framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision
Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This
modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different
scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a
system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.
LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the
VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen
environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for
visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is
introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time
localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an
optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally
equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,
the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.
Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

TL;DR: LITEN方法通过连接VLA低级策略和高级VLM，利用过去经验进行上下文学习，使机器人能够从失败中反思并调整策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言动作模型缺乏在任务失败时动态调整行为的能力，需要一种能够从执行经验中学习的方法。

Method: 在推理阶段生成并执行低级VLA计划，在评估阶段反思执行结果并提取有用结论，将经验纳入后续推理上下文。

Result: 实验表明LITEN能够有效从过去经验中学习，生成使用高可用性指令完成长时程任务的计划。

Conclusion: LITEN通过连接高低级模型并利用执行经验进行上下文学习，显著提升了机器人解决复杂控制任务的能力。

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we
fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy
accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics,
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving
complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically
readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we
introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA
low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by
including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and
capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning
phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an
assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful
conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar
approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on
unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires
structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate
LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that
use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖单步路径点预测，缺乏长期环境理解，导致探索效率不高。

Method: 采用迭代预测-探索框架，基于当前观察预测地图缺失区域，使用实际地图与预测全局地图的差异指导探索，并设计基于强化学习的奖励机制更新长期探索策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在相同时间限制下显著优于最先进的探索策略，获得更优的全局地图覆盖率。

Conclusion: SEA方法通过语义地图预测和强化学习层次策略，实现了更高效的机器人探索，提升了长期环境理解能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration
through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical
exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on
one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term
environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We
propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts
the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference
between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to
guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that
leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration
strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited
steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior
coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一个3D优化框架，联合校准AI推理扩展中的准确性、成本和延迟，解决了传统1D和2D优化方法无法考虑多约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI推理扩展方法使用1D启发式或2D双变量权衡，无法同时考虑成本、延迟等实际部署约束，需要更全面的优化框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上，评估了四种优化方法来解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化实现了最佳平衡，而精度最大化在优先考虑精度时仍然有利。该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展建立了理论基础。

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法覆盖的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

Motivation: 当前AI模型在临床应用中受限于样本量不足，需要可靠的脑功能影像基础模型来提升性能

Method: 多任务预训练：标记脑-环境交互；半监督微调：使用预训练的脑-环境交互伪标签

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病、精神分裂症等疾病的早期诊断中取得有前景的结果

Conclusion: 该基础模型具有促进当前神经影像在临床常规应用中应用的巨大潜力

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

*Wang Zixian*

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表偏好建模，在噪声环境中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，无法处理偏好不确定性、训练不稳定性和列表偏好场景。ADPO旨在解决这些问题，提供更鲁棒的偏好优化方法。

Method: 引入软偏好概率编码不确定性；使用任意参考策略锚定实现训练稳定；通过Plackett-Luce分布进行列表偏好建模；开发了三种实用变体：成对锚定Soft-DPO、列表锚定Soft-DPO和KDE列表平滑。

Result: 在上下文赌博机中，锚定比标准DPO提升WinMass 38-63%；KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在顺序强化学习中，锚定提升噪声偏好性能15-29%。

Conclusion: ADPO成功将DPO、Bradley-Terry目标和Top-1-vs-Rest公式统一为特例，为不同噪声环境提供了明确指导：清洁或中等噪声使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，极端污染使用KDE列表ADPO。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Conclusion: MLX框架在苹果硅设备上展现出高效运行设备端机器学习应用的潜力，为苹果生态系统内的机器学习应用提供了更便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Conclusion: 将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF相结合，为噪声现实世界部署提供了理论洞见和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应平衡正负样本贡献，保持策略熵并稳定优化过程。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源模型，32B BAPO模型在同规模模型中达到SOTA，甚至优于o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO通过解决离线强化学习中的优化不平衡问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练，为大语言模型对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络的泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常被认为能再现定性泛化趋势。本文旨在揭示这些后验泛化度量的脆弱性。

Method: 通过实验分析各种泛化度量（如路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理）对微小训练修改的敏感性。

Result: 发现许多泛化度量对超参数调整高度敏感，例如学习率调整或SGD变体切换可以反转学习曲线的斜率。PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数调整较不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 许多后验泛化度量是脆弱的，新度量开发者应明确审计其脆弱性，以确保度量的可靠性。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并引入旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在局限性：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，不适合细粒度适配；而选择性原位适配方法虽然更精确有效，但内存消耗显著增加。需要平衡这一权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数（连接），然后为这些选定参数引入旁路连接。在微调过程中，只更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实证结果表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数就能达到最先进的性能，同时将CUDA内存使用量减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了参数高效微调中的权衡问题，在保持高内存效率的同时实现了细粒度模型适配。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

TL;DR: 提出对抗性师生蒸馏框架，通过可微分数值求解器监督紧凑神经算子，并使用PGD风格主动采样搜索最坏情况输入，提升神经算子的分布外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非线性PDE求解器计算成本高，神经算子虽然推理快但分布外泛化能力差，需要提升其在未见输入上的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用可微分谱求解器进行梯度对抗搜索，通过PGD风格主动采样在平滑性和能量约束下寻找最坏情况输入来扩展训练集。

Result: 在Burgers和Navier-Stokes系统上的实验表明，对抗蒸馏显著提高了分布外鲁棒性，同时保持了神经算子的低参数成本和快速推理优势。

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，为快速PDE求解提供了鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Motivation: 自编码器在时间序列异常检测中广泛应用，但其学习到的表示对训练时间序列中的异常敏感，导致准确性降低。需要解决训练数据被污染时的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出编码-分解范式，将编码表示分解为稳定表示和辅助表示；使用基于互信息的新指标替代传统的重构误差来识别异常。

Conclusion: 提出的编码-分解范式和基于互信息的异常检测方法有效提升了在受污染训练数据下的检测性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Motivation: 当前医疗实践依赖标准化治疗框架和经验方法，忽视患者个体差异，导致次优健康结果。需要个性化医疗方法来适应特定患者特征。

Method: 使用LLM处理非结构化医疗文本为结构化数据，CTGAN生成合成患者数据，T-learner预测个体治疗反应，上下文bandit优化在线治疗选择。

Result: LLM处理准确率93.2%，CTGAN生成数据准确率55%，T-learner预测准确率84.3%，KernelUCB在5000轮中获得0.60-0.61平均奖励分数，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了在线学习环境的冷启动限制，提高了计算效率，在个性化医疗方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，解释人工神经网络中类别学习如何导致类别边界附近的神经表征扩展，这是通过最大化类别与神经活动之间的互信息来实现的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人工神经网络中类别学习如何影响神经表征，特别是为什么在类别边界附近会出现表征扩展现象，这被称为类别感知。

Method: 通过最小化贝叶斯成本（交叉熵损失的平均值）来最大化类别与决策层前神经活动之间的互信息，并分析Fisher信息矩阵在神经表征中的作用。

Result: 研究发现最优学习使神经Fisher信息遵循类别特定的Fisher信息，导致类别边界附近的神经空间扩展，且最大值通常不在边界上而是在边界附近。

Conclusion: 类别学习通过最大化互信息诱导神经表征在决策边界附近扩展，这一现象可以通过Fisher信息矩阵的理论框架来解释，并与信息瓶颈方法相关。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深度复杂的结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发了ShapeCART算法来学习SGT；进一步扩展到双变量形状函数（S²GT）和多路树（SGT_K）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优的性能，同时减少了模型大小。

Conclusion: SGT在保持可解释性的前提下，通过非线性形状分割显著提升了决策树的表达能力，实现了性能与模型复杂度的更好平衡。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习后门攻击方法基于规则选择关键层，未考虑层间关系，导致效果不佳且易被检测。需要更智能的层选择策略来提高攻击效果和隐蔽性。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，采用基于伯努利采样的轻量级强化学习，通过策略梯度更新优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: POLAR在对抗6种最先进防御方法时，相比最新攻击方法效果提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在联邦学习后门攻击中的有效性，能够动态学习攻击策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时显著提高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证研究发现，Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) 的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而权重衰减才是真正稳定内部表示更新动态的关键因素，这挑战了现有的学习率迁移认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何将小神经网络的最优学习率有效迁移到大网络中，以解决超参数调优在大规模训练中的高昂成本问题。

Method: 采用大规模实证研究方法，在实际训练设置（如LLM训练）中验证muP假设的有效性，并分析权重衰减的作用。

Result: 研究发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，而权重衰减在整个训练过程中都能稳定内部表示的更新动态，促进学习率迁移。muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现从根本上挑战了关于学习率迁移的普遍认知，解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功实现迁移，并建议可以用改进的预热调度来替代muP。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

Motivation: 解决课程学习在LLM推理中的基本问题：何时有效、哪种方向更好、答案是否取决于评估指标，通过统一框架比较不同的难度度量方法。

Method: 使用统一离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个维度：问题难度、模型惊讶度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性，在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控后训练实验。

Result: 发现没有通用最优课程策略，前向与反向课程学习的相对效果取决于模型能力和任务复杂度；同一度量中不同难度样本在不同任务中产生不同收益；任务对齐课程关注最终表示和泛化，内部状态课程调节置信度和不确定性等内部状态。

Conclusion: 挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务提供实用指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用向量权重替代标量权重，虽然提升了表达能力和准确性，但导致参数和内存呈乘性增长，需要压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，使其位于低维流形上，然后进行K-means聚类，用共享质心替换每边向量。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster将参数存储减少高达80倍，且准确性无损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数爆炸问题，实现了高效的模型压缩，同时保持性能不变。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在社交网络中，用户推荐的成功率高度依赖于上下文因素，准确估计这些影响力概率对于理解信息传播过程和改进病毒式营销策略至关重要。然而，从数据中学习这些概率具有挑战性：静态数据只能捕捉相关性，而在线学习算法要么浪费资源进行随机探索，要么偏向于探索影响力概率较高的空间。

Method: 采用上下文线性赌博机框架，提出了一种不确定性引导的探索算法，通过调整参数可以在遗憾最小化与估计误差之间实现任何可达到的权衡对。

Result: 在半合成网络数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机方法。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了学习同伴影响力概率时的基本权衡关系，并提供了能够灵活控制探索与利用平衡的有效算法，为信息传播建模和营销策略优化提供了理论和方法支持。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

Conclusion: MusicRFM框架成功展示了在保持预训练模型冻结的情况下实现细粒度音乐控制的能力，为音乐领域的RFM应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争性性能。

Conclusion: InvarGC方法能够有效解决传统Granger因果分析的局限性，在存在潜在混杂和未知干预的情况下恢复因果结构。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 结果表明依赖合成数据的AI系统存在关键漏洞，需要能够应对潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于纯值函数的连续控制框架，通过结构最大化Q函数实现高效稳定的学习，无需单独学习actor网络，在约束动作空间中表现优于传统actor-critic方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于值的算法仅限于离散动作空间，在连续动作空间中计算不可行。虽然actor-critic方法被广泛使用，但训练过程不稳定。本文旨在开发一种纯值函数的连续控制方法。

Method: 采用结构最大化Q函数的方法，引入关键架构和算法选择，实现无actor的Q学习框架。

Result: 在标准仿真任务中表现出与最先进基线相当的性能和样本效率，在约束动作空间中优于传统actor-critic方法。

Conclusion: 证明了纯值函数方法在连续控制任务中的可行性，特别是在非平滑值函数环境中具有优势。

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种特征空间微调方法LoRFA和VeFA，通过轻量级特征变换补偿下游潜伏变量影响，在保持预训练知识的同时提升分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当下游领域数据有限或与预训练分布差异大时，现有参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作可能导致模型过度专业化。

Method: 在特征空间进行微调，提出LoRFA（低秩特征适应）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适应），基于效应等价建模理论补偿下游潜伏变量的影响。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上，特征空间适应方法取得了与标准微调相当的结果，并在鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 特征空间适应能够有效保留预训练表示，提高模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，是缓解灾难性遗忘的有效方法。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对线性部分监测问题的非随机对抗性算法，通过探索优化方法实现高效实现，获得了更透明的遗憾界分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典部分监测问题只能处理有限结果空间，而线性部分监测可以建模无限结果空间，同时在线性结构和观测之间提供更灵活的损失-反馈解耦机制。

Method: 采用探索优化方法的简单实例，适用于非随机对抗性有限动作的线性部分监测问题，实现高效计算。

Result: 获得了依赖游戏结构的透明遗憾界，包含反映观测与损失对齐程度的实例特定量，在易游戏中达到√T速率，在难游戏中达到T^{2/3}速率。

Conclusion: 该算法在线性部分监测框架下统一了多种部分信息设置，在某些有趣情况下对游戏结构的依赖是最优的。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Motivation: 整合多样化数据对于改善科学探索至关重要，本研究旨在开发一个能够自动分类小鼠在环境中各种行为的模型，为跨学科研究提供支持。

Method: 使用开源Qwen2.5-VL模型，通过提示工程、上下文学习和帧级预处理来增强模型性能，无需进行模型微调。

Result: 这些方法都提高了分类性能，组合使用时在所有行为类别（包括罕见的冻结和逃跑行为）上都获得了较高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该模型将帮助跨学科研究人员整合不同时间点和环境中的行为特征，构建能够解决复杂研究问题的综合数据集。

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Conclusion: 该框架在严重环境干扰下表现出鲁棒性，适用于网络物理系统中的安全智能导航。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

TL;DR: 本文为随机自然梯度变分推断(NGVI)在非共轭模型中的理论分析提供了新进展，包括相对平滑性条件、改进算法的全局收敛性证明，以及在特定结构下的快速全局收敛结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NGVI在实践中广泛使用且效果显著，但其理论基础在非共轭似然情况下仍然有限。现有收敛性分析主要针对共轭模型，无法扩展到非共轭设置，其中变分损失变得非凸且难以分析。

Method: 针对均值场参数化，首先推导变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件；然后提出包含非欧几里得投影的改进NGVI算法；最后在特定似然结构假设下分析变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Result: 证明了改进NGVI算法的全局非渐近收敛到驻点；在额外结构假设下，建立了NGVI快速全局收敛到全局最优解的结果。

Conclusion: 这些结果为NGVI在挑战性推断设置中的几何性质和收敛行为提供了新的理论见解，填补了非共轭模型下NGVI理论分析的空白。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 多任务后训练中的梯度不平衡问题：某些任务产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务，但大梯度并不一定带来更大的学习收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务后训练假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但本文发现这一假设在RL后训练中不成立，某些任务会产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏差。

Method: 通过分析RL后训练中不同任务的梯度大小和学习收益，研究梯度不平衡现象及其影响。

Result: 发现大梯度任务的学习收益可能与小梯度任务相似甚至更低，梯度不平衡不能通过训练奖励或优势值等典型统计量解释，而是源于任务间的固有差异。

Conclusion: 警告不要简单地混合数据集，呼吁未来研究开发基于梯度的校正方法来解决LLMs中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Conclusion: 语义世界模型通过预测任务相关语义信息而非像素，能够更好地服务于规划决策，并继承预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Conclusion: 该框架有效降低了多智能体强化学习的通信负担，同时保证了收敛性能，为通信受限环境下的多智能体学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: ADGNN能有效克服过平滑问题，在保持节点独特性的同时高效获取图的全局结构信息。

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，并通过CUP算法的可控导航机制，有效解决了传统方法在遗忘效果与模型保真度之间的权衡挑战，提供了更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）中设计选择对模型质量的隐性影响，通过理论和实证研究揭示了训练过程中的各种"旋钮"如何导致模型在时间行为、几何结构等方面的隐性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解时间序列基础模型训练过程中各种设计选择如何影响模型质量，而不是开发新模型并声称其在现有基准上表现更好。

Method: 使用理论和受控实证评估相结合的方法，分析补丁大小、嵌入选择、训练目标等设计选择如何导致模型在基本属性上的隐性偏差。

Result: 识别了多种设计选择及其导致的隐性偏差，这些偏差可能是直观的或非常反直觉的，取决于模型和数据的特性。通过异常值处理的案例研究展示了多种偏差如何复杂地相互作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果对学习"苦涩教训"和构建时间序列基础模型具有重要意义，强调了理解设计选择隐性影响的重要性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOT是一种用于计算可解释决策树策略的新方法，将优化问题表述为混合整数线性规划，通过解耦MDP动态与树结构约束实现高效并行搜索，大幅提升运行时间和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策中需要可解释的强化学习策略，但在马尔可夫决策过程中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出SPOT方法，将决策树策略优化问题表述为混合整数线性规划，采用缩减空间的分支定界方法，解耦MDP动态与树结构约束以实现高效并行搜索。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著的速度提升，可扩展到具有更多状态的大型MDP，产生的决策树策略既可解释又紧凑，在保持透明性的同时不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，以比现有方法快一个数量级的速度提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

*Yiyu Qian,Su Nguyen,Chao Chen,Qinyue Zhou,Liyuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SILVER with RL-guided labeling，通过将RL策略自身动作输出纳入边界点识别，将SILVER框架扩展到多动作和高维环境，显著提高了深度强化学习的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能卓越但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域，需要扩展到更复杂的环境。

Method: 首先从图像观测中提取紧凑特征表示，执行基于SHAP的特征归因，然后使用RL引导标签生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，结果表明该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 该工作通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释强化学习在高维多动作设置中的应用。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GraMixC模块，通过提取配置、对齐和融合来改进下游任务的预测性能，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类具有按相似性分组对象的天生能力，聚类算法旨在模拟这种认知机制。最近社区检测的进展使得能够在多个分辨率尺度上发现有效的层次聚类配置，而无需标记数据。

Method: 引入GraMixC模块，该模块提取配置，使用反向合并/拆分(RMS)技术对齐它们，并通过注意力头融合它们，然后将其传递给任何下游预测器。

Result: 在DSN1 16S rRNA培养介质预测任务中，GraMixC将R2得分从0.6提高到0.9，在多个方法上创造了新的最先进水平。在标准表格基准测试中也持续优于单分辨率和静态特征基线。

Conclusion: 配置比寄存器令牌具有更低的冗余性，无需临时选择，可以通过无监督或自监督方法学习。GraMixC模块能够有效提取和融合这些配置，显著提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了FnRGNN框架，用于图神经网络节点回归任务的公平性处理，通过结构级、表示级和预测级的多层次干预来减少群体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在结构化数据学习中表现出色，但回归任务中的公平性问题研究不足。现有方法主要针对分类任务和表示级去偏，无法完全处理节点级回归的连续特性。

Method: FnRGNN框架在三个层次进行干预：结构级边重加权、表示级通过MMD进行对齐、预测级通过Sinkhorn分布匹配进行归一化。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，FnRGNN能够减少群体差异，同时不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 多层次的公平性处理策略能够在复杂图拓扑下确保鲁棒的公平性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出CAB框架，通过注意力桥接实现跨架构蒸馏，将Transformer教师模型的知识高效转移到状态空间学生模型中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽在序列建模中具有可扩展性优势，但其训练成本高且生态系统不成熟，且与Transformer的结构异质性使得知识蒸馏困难

Method: CAB框架使用轻量级注意力桥接实现token级监督，并采用灵活的层间对齐策略来适应师生模型架构差异

Result: 在视觉和语言领域的广泛实验表明，该方法在有限训练数据下持续提升状态空间模型性能，优于标准和跨架构蒸馏方法

Conclusion: 基于注意力的知识可以有效转移到循环模型中，为构建更强的SSM社区快速利用Transformer专业知识提供了可能

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出高斯蒸馏方法，通过深度潜在因子模型将教师集成压缩为单一学生分布，解决知识蒸馏中不确定性保持问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成虽能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用；现有知识蒸馏方法在压缩模型大小时难以保持不确定性

Method: 使用深度潜在因子模型将教师集成视为随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化算法稳定估计均值和协方差函数，实现分布蒸馏

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，高斯蒸馏优于现有基线方法，在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上表现良好

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够压缩教师集成同时保持不确定性量化能力

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

TL;DR: QiMeng-SALV提出信号感知学习框架，通过提取部分错误模块中的已验证信号实现来优化Verilog代码生成的强化学习训练，解决了功能奖励不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面取得显著进展，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，难以生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 通过比较生成模块与参考模块的信号功能正确性，利用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码段，引入信号感知DPO在正确的信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中达到最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，并显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV实现了从传统模块级优化到细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，有效解决了Verilog代码生成中功能奖励不足的问题。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs)通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，显著提升离散扩散模型的文本生成质量，在困惑度上比基线降低61%，接近甚至超越自回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型通过并行解码提供替代自回归生成的方案，但存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限。

Method: 提出Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，采用自条件策略高效训练LDDMs。

Result: LDDMs将生成困惑度比基线降低高达61%，接近甚至超越自回归模型，生成文本更连贯；在推理任务中提升Countdown和Game of 24等算术基准性能。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为高质量非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Method: 应用深度学习和数据插补技术，采用数据平衡方法，进行特征选择识别关键环境因子，构建融合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量的多模态集成模型。

Result: 数据平衡显著提升模型性能，蛙类计数任务MAE从189降至29；多模态集成模型优于单一模型，在未知区域泛化能力强；图像与表格数据融合在栖息地分类中达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和插补）能够显著提升生态预测模型在数据稀疏或不完整情况下的性能，为更精确、可扩展的生物多样性监测提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,

Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention

long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的预测形式对实际应用价值的影响，指出虽然这些模型在预测精度上表现良好，但预测形式(点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成)决定了其能支持的操作任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TSFMs主要关注预测精度，但忽略了预测形式对实际应用价值的关键影响。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保持时间依赖性，而大多数模型只提供点预测或参数预测。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFMs，建立预测类型转换的理论框架，证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型。

Result: 研究发现三分之二的TSFMs只产生点预测或参数预测，而许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测。证明了边际分布相同的无限多联合分布对操作问题给出不同答案。

Conclusion: 预测类型而非精度往往决定了实际效用，需要任务对齐的评估框架来确保预测形式满足操作需求。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Motivation: 传统对抗样本是在原始样本附近添加微小扰动导致模型误分类，而本文探索相反方向：生成与原始样本差异很大但仍保持相同分类结果的样本。

Method: 提出了负迭代快速梯度符号方法(NI-FGSM)、负迭代快速梯度方法(NI-FGM)及其动量变体(NMI-FGSM、NMI-FGM)，通过迭代优化生成与原始样本差异最大化但分类结果不变的对抗样本。

Result: 成功生成了与原始样本显著不同但分类结果相同的对抗样本，证明对抗样本不仅分布在原始样本邻域，而是广泛分布于整个样本空间。

Conclusion: 对抗样本的分布范围比传统认知更广泛，这些新方法可用于特定场景下的机器学习系统攻击，为模型安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BBMDP，一种用于分支定界法中变量选择的MDP公式，通过强化学习算法学习最优分支启发式策略，在四个标准MILP基准测试中优于现有最先进的RL智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分支定界求解器的性能受变量选择启发式策略影响，现有工作尝试用强化学习学习最优分支策略，但缺乏统一的MDP公式化方法。

Method: 提出了BBMDP，一个用于分支定界变量选择的原始MDP公式，能够利用广泛的RL算法来学习最优分支启发式策略。

Result: 计算实验验证了该模型，其分支智能体在四个标准MILP基准测试中优于先前最先进的RL智能体。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP公式化方法，能够有效学习分支定界中的最优变量选择策略，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出Scalable LinUCB算法，通过动态低秩参数化逆Cholesky因子，实现快速内存高效的线性上下文赌博机操作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LinUCB在推荐系统中广泛应用，但其训练、推理和内存成本随特征维度和动作空间大小增长，关键瓶颈是需要更新、求逆和存储设计矩阵

Method: 使用动态低秩参数化逆Cholesky因子，推导数值稳定的秩1和批量更新，无需直接形成整个矩阵，采用投影器分裂积分器控制内存增长

Result: 实现平均每步更新成本O(dr)和内存O(dr)，推理复杂度为O(dr)每动作评估，在推荐系统数据集上验证有效性

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法显著降低了LinUCB的计算和内存需求，使其更适合大规模推荐系统应用

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前新优化技术在扩散模型训练中的评估往往缺失，需要系统性地比较不同优化算法在扩散模型训练中的效果。

Method: 通过基准测试比较多种优化算法（包括Muon、SOAP、AdamW等）在训练扩散模型进行去噪流轨迹时的性能表现。

algorithms for training a diffusion model for denoising flow trajectories. We
observe that Muon and SOAP are highly efficient alternatives to AdamW (18%
lower final loss). We also revisit several recent phenomena related to the
training of models for text or image applications in the context of diffusion
model training. This includes the impact of the learning-rate schedule on the
training dynamics, and the performance gap between Adam and SGD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从多变量时间序列中提取系统“年龄”代理特征的方法，通过优化公式的单调性来发现能代表系统老化过程的潜在特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接的“年龄”信息。需要从现有数据中发现能代表系统老化过程的代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式与时间之间的Spearman秩相关系数的绝对值来评估单调性，从而发现具有高单调性的潜在特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将单调性较低的单传感器组合成具有高单调性的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，两个Spearman ρ值分别为0.13和0.09的特征被组合成ρ值为0.95的代理特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够发现可解释的公式，这些公式可以作为系统“年龄”的有效代理特征。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图-文本对齐框架，能够根据监督质量在表达性多对多和保守一对一目标之间动态调整，解决了现有方法在噪声监督下的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图-文本对齐器存在两个关键限制：假设节点与文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了现实图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标，无法适应不同的数据质量，在噪声监督下表现脆弱。

Method: ADAligner实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性，并相应调整优化策略：在监督干净时促进软性、子图级别的多对多对齐，在噪声情况下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上始终优于先前的图-文本对齐器。在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，相比多模态基线加速预训练约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实网络环境中的图-文本表示学习建立了一个可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制解决了图-文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法，通过智能分割参数矩阵，直接保留高分解误差的列，仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率，显著提升LLM压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法对整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽略了不同矩阵部分SVD近似误差的显著差异，导致压缩效果不理想。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，同时自适应分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上持续优于最先进的SVD压缩方法，获得更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，有效解决了传统SVD压缩的局限性，为LLM高效压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应秩分配(ARA)方法解决SVD压缩大语言模型时的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解，在80%压缩比下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与参数关系，且忽视增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计实现保留秩与可训练参数的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数引导参数选择趋向全局最优解

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD基础的大语言模型压缩中实现了最先进的秩分配性能

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

TL;DR: 提出IFeF-PINN算法，通过傅里叶特征增强来克服PINNs中的频谱偏差问题，采用迭代训练策略提高高频PDE的逼近精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理信息神经网络(PINNs)中频谱偏差的问题，即神经网络倾向于先学习低频特征，导致高频PDE求解不准确。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征增强潜在空间，创建两阶段训练：估计特征空间基函数和执行回归确定增强基函数系数。对于线性模型，回归问题是凸的，迭代训练方案收敛。

Result: 通过经典基准问题的广泛数值评估，显示该方法在性能上优于最先进算法，并在整个频域上展示了改进的逼近能力。

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强有效克服了频谱偏差，提高了PINNs对高频PDE的求解精度，迭代训练方案具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet是一个动态实例级公平性校正框架，通过偏置检测器和条件低秩适配技术，仅在识别为有偏见的实例上激活公平性校正，同时保持无偏见实例的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法往往牺牲模型性能，依赖静态校正策略，难以处理数据稀疏问题，特别是少数群体的数据稀疏。对敏感属性的利用也不理想，要么过度依赖完整标签，要么完全忽略这些属性。

Method: 集成偏置检测器与条件低秩适配(LoRA)，选择性激活公平性校正机制；提出新的对比损失函数训练LoRA模块，最小化不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异；灵活处理完整、部分或完全缺失的敏感属性标签。

Result: 理论分析表明，在偏置检测器中等TPR/FPR条件下，FairNet能提升最差群体性能而不降低整体模型性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升。在多种视觉和语言基准测试中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一个灵活有效的公平性校正框架，能够动态处理不同敏感属性标签情况，在提升公平性的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的遗忘学习方法BS框架，通过同时抑制目标响应和模型信念来对抗梯度上升方法导致的概率质量挤压效应，实现更彻底的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘学习方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但这种方法会导致概率质量重新分配到高似然区域，产生语义相关的重新表述，造成虚假遗忘。

Method: 提出bootstrapping框架，将挤压效应与模型自身的高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。BS-T衰减高概率token，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成，共同实现更彻底的遗忘。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和多种模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，能够实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: 通过显式地将挤压效应与模型信念联系起来，BS框架能够更有效地对抗虚假遗忘问题，为语言模型的安全部署提供更可靠的遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Method: 使用低秩伯努利专家元模型进行内存高效的dropout率映射，基于任务数据的先验优化条件dropout后验的摊销变分推断。

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的dropout率，处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，在元学习中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Method: 在不同数据集上测试对抗鲁棒模型的表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层对预测差异的影响，通过重新训练分类器来改善预测行为的普适性

Result: 在特定设置下验证了Jones关于高表示相似性的主要主张，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不随鲁棒性增加而收敛；分类层是预测差异的来源；通过重新训练分类器可以实现更普适的预测行为

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下存在部分普适性，但远离严格普适性的概念，支持特定条件下的部分普适性而非严格普适性

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

TL;DR: g-DPO通过序列空间聚类和分组近似方法，解决了DPO在蛋白质语言模型中对齐实验设计目标时的可扩展性瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时显著加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO方法面临可扩展性瓶颈：训练对的数量随标记序列数量呈二次方增长，导致即使对于中等规模的数据集，训练时间也变得难以承受。

Method: g-DPO框架：(i)使用序列空间聚类来修剪冗余训练对，同时保留训练信号；(ii)通过基于分组的近似方法来分摊似然计算成本。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO保持了与标准DPO在计算机模拟和体外实验中统计上无法区分的性能，同时收敛速度提高了1.8到3.7倍，且随着数据集规模增大，增益预期会更大。

Conclusion: g-DPO是一个有效的框架，能够在保持DPO性能的同时显著提高训练效率，解决了蛋白质语言模型对齐中的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Conclusion: INPO框架通过减缓发散速度和改善模型效用鲁棒性，在图遗忘任务中取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

*Xin Nie,Liang Dong,HaiCheng Zhang,JiaWang Xiao,G. Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ是一个高效的量化框架，通过引入分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，在CPU边缘设备上优化LLM部署，显著降低内存使用和延迟，同时消除反量化开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPU边缘设备上部署LLM面临内存和计算资源有限的挑战，现有均匀量化方法无法很好地适应权重分布，且在低比特宽度下反量化开销高。

Method: 提出ELUTQ框架和HLQ量化格式，该格式能更好地捕捉权重统计特性，同时不增加基于查找表的GEMM操作计算成本，可无缝集成到各种量化流程中。

Result: 在LLaMA3-8B上，HLQ在3位精度下降低困惑度约8%，2位精度下降低85%；2位LLaMA2-7B在Apple M2芯片上达到超过25 tokens/s的推理速度。

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ量化格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，实现了高效的量化推理性能。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpikeQuant是一种结合脉冲神经网络(SNN)和混合精度量化的方法，用于在边缘设备上高效部署大语言模型(LLM)，通过将激活值重新编码为二进制脉冲计数来避免MAC操作和显式反量化，显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM量化面临的三个关键挑战：MAC操作能耗高、反量化引入额外开销、统一比特宽度会裁剪重要值。受SNN的二进制脉冲表示和IF机制的启发，利用其天然支持混合精度存储和高效计算的优势。

Method: 选择性对具有显著值的激活应用混合精度量化，并将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数；通过将量化尺度嵌入IF机制的阈值中，在权重和激活上执行高效的线性变换，避免显式反量化操作。

Result: 在W4A4量化下持续实现接近FP16的困惑度，同时相比现有方法能耗降低高达4.6倍。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant为准确且节能的LLM部署提供了有效解决方案，特别适合能源受限的硬件环境。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于一致性的方法主要依赖单个LLM生成多个响应，但受限于训练数据的不完善性，包括偏见和信息不足等问题，导致幻觉问题。

Method: 将单模型一致性方法扩展到多个LLM，形成联盟一致性方法，结合不同训练数据、训练方案和模型架构的LLM响应。

Result: 相比单模型一致性方法，多模型一致性方法在幻觉检测和缓解方面有显著改进，且通常能降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 多模型一致性方法能有效提升幻觉检测和缓解性能，同时克服单模型方法的高推理成本缺点，为LLM应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于原型的框架，用于为12导联ECG分类模型生成稀疏反事实解释，通过SHAP阈值识别关键信号段，使用DTW和聚类提取原型，并保持信号修改最小化(78%)的同时达到81.3%的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决最先进模型在时间序列数据（特别是医疗领域如ECG分类）中的可解释性挑战，提供可操作且可解释的洞察。

Method: 使用SHAP阈值识别关键信号段并转换为区间规则，采用动态时间规整(DTW)和聚类提取代表性原型，将原型与查询R峰对齐以确保解释一致性。

Result: 生成的反事实解释仅修改原始信号的78%，在所有类别中保持81.3%的有效性，时间稳定性提高43%。心肌梗死(MI)类别的有效性达98.9%，但肥厚(HYP)检测面临挑战(13.2%)。

Conclusion: 该方法支持近实时生成(<1秒)临床有效的反事实解释，为交互式解释平台奠定基础，确立了AI诊断系统中生理感知反事实解释的设计原则。

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL)方法，解决传统两阶段营销策略中预测与决策不匹配、偏差-方差权衡的问题，通过双层优化框架联合利用观察和实验数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台需要优化营销策略，但传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策不匹配问题，且观察数据有偏差、实验数据稀缺导致高方差估计。

Method: 开发基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数连接离散优化梯度；建立双层优化框架，通过隐式微分联合利用观察和实验数据。

Result: 在公共基准、工业营销数据集和大规模在线A/B测试中验证了有效性，相比最先进方法有显著改进，已在美团平台部署。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL方法能系统解决营销策略优化中的核心挑战，实现最优的偏差-方差权衡，提升决策质量。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

TL;DR: 提出REBMBO方法，将高斯过程与能量基模型结合，使用PPO算法实现自适应多步前瞻，克服传统贝叶斯优化的单步偏差问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法存在显著的单步偏差，容易收敛到局部最优，在复杂或高维任务中表现不佳

Method: 集成高斯过程进行局部指导，使用能量基模型捕获全局结构信息，将每次BO迭代定义为马尔可夫决策过程，采用PPO算法实现自适应多步前瞻

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中表现出优越性能，在不同GP配置下显示出良好的适应性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: REBMBO方法有效克服了传统BO方法的局限性，在复杂优化任务中具有显著优势

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Result: 在综合控制套件上的基准测试表明，MED-LQ在各种场景下实现竞争性性能。

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大型MDP中更广泛应用潜力，为未知动态线性系统控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Conclusion: 在分子数据的联邦多样性分析中，整合领域知识通过化学信息指标和客户端可解释性分析至关重要。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的新方法，通过学习建筑疏散模式实现高效疏散模拟，相比传统方法建模负担更轻、速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细化建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段快速迭代过程中应用，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 建立399个不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集，提出解耦特征表示嵌入物理特征，基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比现有条件GAN方法，SSIM提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度快16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了快速设计迭代效率，为智能建筑安全优化提供了新思路，降低了建模负担，支持大规模假设探索。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，这限制了其在下游任务中的表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个不同的潜在空间，通过新的证据下界公式促进潜在空间之间的因子分解，一个空间专门用于任务显著特征，另一个用于残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过明确分离任务相关特征和残差信息，显著提升了LoRA在下游任务中的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/idiap/FVAE-LoRA

Conclusion: 提出的重叠加权正交元学习器能够有效解决时变环境下异质性处理效应估计中的治疗序列重叠不足问题，提供更可靠的HTE估计，且具有模型无关性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究带有弃权机制的政策学习，允许策略在不确定时选择默认选项，并提出两阶段学习器实现快速后悔保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统政策学习算法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许策略在不确定时弃权，转向安全默认选项。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：首先识别一组近似最优策略，然后基于它们的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 在已知倾向得分时获得O(1/n)型快速后悔保证，并扩展到未知倾向得分情况。弃权机制可改善边界条件下的保证，连接分布鲁棒学习，支持安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是政策学习中的多功能工具，可在不确定时提供安全机制，改善学习保证，并支持鲁棒和安全策略改进。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模增大而部署环境资源受限，内存高效的深度神经网络训练变得越来越重要。

Method: 提出动态通道选择方法，在预选层中随机重新采样通道，利用架构相关的层重要性先验知识和动态随机通道选择提供更优的梯度近似。

Result: 在多种下游任务和架构上实现最先进性能，达到99%激活稀疏度、95%权重导数稀疏度，权重导数计算的FLOPs减少97%。

Conclusion: TraDy在保持严格内存约束的同时，实现了高效的深度学习训练，为资源受限环境下的模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了分层推测解码算法，通过将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构来加速Transformer语言模型的推理过程，相比最佳单草稿基线可获得1.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码技术使用单一草稿模型，但实际应用中存在多个潜在草稿模型，从快速但不准确到慢速但可靠不等。如何有效利用这些模型组合来进一步降低推理延迟是研究动机。

Method: HSD算法将草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型提出token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证这些token，最终由目标模型验证所有token。

Result: 推导了任意此类层次结构的期望延迟表达式，证明选择延迟最优的层次结构可以在多项式时间内完成。实验表明HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可获得1.2倍加速。

Conclusion: HSD算法通过层次化利用多个草稿模型，有效降低了Transformer语言模型的生成延迟，超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

TL;DR: SEMPO是一个轻量级时间序列基础模型，通过能量感知频谱分解和混合提示Transformer，在减少预训练数据量和模型规模的同时，实现了强大的零样本和少样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练数据和庞大网络架构，在资源受限环境中部署困难。为了解决通用性与可负担性之间的矛盾，需要开发轻量级但性能强大的模型。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量但信息丰富的频率信号，提高预训练数据利用率；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应地将时间序列token路由到基于提示的专家模块，实现参数高效适配。

Result: 在包含16个数据集的2个大规模基准测试中，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景下均优于现有最优方法，显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小。

Conclusion: SEMPO成功解决了时间序列基础模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题，在保持强大泛化能力的同时显著降低了计算和存储需求。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出增强型TimeAutoDiff框架，通过合成ICU时间序列数据来训练和评估预测模型，显著减少真实-合成数据评估差距，并在细粒度人口亚组中提高性能评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI中模型评估的隐私保护和可信度问题，特别是在ICU环境中，需要在不暴露敏感电子健康记录的情况下进行细粒度、可信的模型评估。

Method: 基于先前的扩散和VAE生成器，引入增强型TimeAutoDiff，在潜在扩散目标中加入分布对齐惩罚项，在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上对24小时死亡率和住院时间任务进行基准测试。

Result: 增强型TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成数据评估差距减少70%以上（Δ_TRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC），同时保持训练效用（Δ_TSTR ≈ 0.01）。在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少高达50%，并在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 这项工作为重症监护中可信、细粒度的模型评估提供了实用的隐私保护路线图，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析，而无需暴露敏感EHR数据，有助于提升医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其不确定性，现有高维推断方法计算昂贵且维度缩放受限。

Method: 使用在线SGD程序，开发在线方差估计器，并建立该估计器的高概率偏差界。

Result: 当迭代次数t ≳ d^(1+δ)时，SGD迭代满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存为O(d)，优于现有方法的O(td² + d³)运行时间。

Conclusion: 提出了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架，在接近最优缩放机制t ≳ d^(1+δ)下为SGD迭代构建置信区间。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

TL;DR: 本文分析Transformer在算法学习中的局限性，发现其在图连通性问题中倾向于学习简单的启发式方法而非通用算法。通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了模型容量限制对学习策略的关键影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在实际应用中经常学习脆弱的启发式方法而非可泛化的算法，特别是在图连通性问题上表现明显。本文旨在从理论和实验角度解释这一现象。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，理论证明L层模型能够解决直径不超过3^L的图连通性问题，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂。分析训练动态，研究模型在不同容量范围内的学习策略。

Result: 研究发现：在模型容量范围内的图（直径≤3^L）驱动模型学习正确的算法解，而超出容量的图则导致模型学习基于节点度的简单启发式方法。通过限制训练数据在模型容量内，可以使标准和解耦Transformer都学习精确算法。

Conclusion: 模型容量是决定Transformer学习算法还是启发式方法的关键因素。通过适当限制训练数据范围，可以引导模型学习更通用的算法解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽略不确定性或缺乏将不确定性纳入正式保证的原则性机制，导致解释可能具有误导性或不可靠。

Method: 开发了新颖的局部化共形预测程序，利用离线树基输入空间分区实现高效的MILP编码，生成具有预测不确定性和最优性严格保证的反事实解释。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上评估CONFEX，证明该不确定性感知方法能产生鲁棒且合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX通过结合共形预测和混合整数线性规划，为反事实解释提供了严格的不确定性保证，提高了解释的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Motivation: 现有的最先进成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算成本高的参考模型，限制了实用性。

Method: 利用训练和测试分布的不对称性，通过高损失区域异常值的缺失来预测模型脆弱性，使用简单的损失攻击的真负率来估计模型级脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，特别在大语言模型风险评估方面显示出潜力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏微调技术的效果取决于如何最优选择要微调的模型参数，现有方法在这方面存在局限。

Method: GaLLoP只微调那些在下游任务上梯度幅度最大、预训练幅度最小的参数，优先选择任务相关性强但对预训练知识破坏小的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上均优于或匹配其他参数高效微调技术（如LoRA、DoRA、SAFT），并减轻灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过选择性微调关键参数，实现了更好的性能稳定性和泛化能力，同时保持预训练知识。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: 数据驱动方法依赖I.I.D.数据假设，现有泛化技术需要环境标签，但实际中由于数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性，环境标签往往无法获得。

Method: 通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，实现直接从数据中进行环境分配。

Conclusion: DynaInfer提供了一种无需环境标签的有效环境推断方法，解决了实际应用中环境标签不可获得的问题。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能在元学习设置中作为元学习器，利用少量上下文示例适应新任务，而无需额外训练。现有理论分析大多未涉及正式的元学习场景。

Method: 使用简化Transformer架构，通过梯度下降训练，在线性分类设置中处理类别条件高斯混合模型任务，其中均值向量位于共享的k维子空间。

Result: 训练足够多任务后，Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例即可泛化到新任务，性能接近知道共享子空间的最优学习器，显著优于仅使用上下文数据的方法（需要Ω(d/R^4)示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer可作为有效的元学习器，在元学习设置中实现接近最优的性能，且所需训练任务数量和每任务示例数与环境维度d无关。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.
