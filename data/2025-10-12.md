### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过合成图像增强和多尺度特征融合，解决了小目标检测和真实数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB数据标注有限的挑战，需要开发能够在真实数据上严格评估的实时检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成-真实样本权重平衡策略，并使用数据增强技术平衡数据集类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测管道，保持实时性能，验证了各模块贡献及系统在极端光照和海况下的处理能力。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，并通过组件分析量化了各架构模块的贡献。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval是一个新的文本到视频评估基准，专注于动态相机运动评估，包含45k人工标注和新的背景/前景一致性指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个问题：缺乏对动态相机运动的关注，以及将视频级评分聚合为模型级评分时忽略了视频级评估的重要性

Method: 构建包含强调动态相机运动的提示词基准，收集45k人工标注，提出新的背景场景一致性指标（基于VBench运动平滑度改进）和前景对象一致性指标（跟踪对象实例内的点）

Result: 新指标在视频级和模型级与人类偏好相关性更强（提升超过2个百分点），成为更全面的动态相机运动T2V评估基准

Conclusion: DynamicEval通过关注动态相机运动和提供视频级评估，为文本到视频模型提供了更全面的评估框架

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RISP方法，结合重启惯性机制和基于分数的图像先验，在解决病态成像逆问题时实现快速收敛和高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED主要关注设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速依赖启发式方法。需要弥合这一差距，在保持高质量重建的同时实现快速收敛。

Method: RISP方法结合了重启惯性机制用于快速收敛，同时使用基于分数的图像先验来保证高质量重建。该方法不需要图像先验的凸性假设。

Result: 理论证明RISP比RED具有更快的驻点收敛速度。实验在多种成像逆问题上验证了RISP能够实现快速收敛并获得高质量重建结果。

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性机制和基于分数的先验，成功解决了成像逆问题中收敛速度与重建质量之间的权衡问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图像纯化策略的降噪框架，解决超低剂量CT图像的空间错位问题，结合频域流匹配模型在真实临床数据集上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT显著降低辐射暴露但引入严重噪声和伪影，导致与正常剂量CT图像对之间存在空间错位，现有降噪网络难以直接应用。

Method: 构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集；提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的图像对；设计频域流匹配模型与IP策略协同工作。

Result: IP策略显著提升多个主流降噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能；FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 为解决真实世界uLDCT降噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法D2RA，能够在资源受限的对抗环境下有效移除或削弱水印，揭示了当前水印设计的基本弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，确保内容归属和溯源的水印方法需求日益增长。虽然现有的语义水印方案通过潜在或频域表示提高了鲁棒性，但在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然存在脆弱性。

Method: D2RA是一种无需训练、单图像攻击方法，通过将水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，在不访问底层模型的情况下抑制水印信号，同时保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在多种水印方案上的实验表明，该方法能持续降低水印可检测性，揭示了当前水印设计的基本弱点。

Conclusion: D2RA攻击方法有效暴露了现有水印方案的脆弱性，为改进水印设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个视频风格迁移框架，通过插入低秩适配器和构建合成训练数据，在保持视频内容的同时实现文本指定的风格转换，优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移任务中缺乏配对视频数据监督的挑战，目标是保持输入视频内容的同时根据文本提示渲染目标风格。

Method: 在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器到自注意力层，利用配对的静态图像数据训练，通过共享增强构建合成训练片段，并引入上下文-风格分类器自由引导(CS-CFG)。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在质量和数量上都优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TRAVL微调方法和ImplausiBench基准，用于评估和改进视频生成模型的物理合理性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法

Method: 开发TRAVL微调配方，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块；创建ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频

Result: 现有视频语言模型难以识别物理违规，TRAVL改善了运动编码和判别能力

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为探索和改进多模态模型的物理合理性提供了统一框架

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义光谱-空间融合网络(S3FN)，利用LLM生成的文本描述来增强高光谱图像分类性能，解决了传统单模态模型在训练样本有限和高维数据下的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临训练样本有限、数据维度高导致过拟合的问题，且现有模型多为单模态，仅依赖光谱-空间数据。需要引入额外信息来提升分类性能。

Method: 使用LLM为每个类别生成文本描述，通过BERT或RoBERTa等预训练文本编码器将描述嵌入向量空间，提取有意义的标签语义，实现更好的特征-标签对齐。

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集上评估，性能显著提升，证明了文本语义与光谱-空间数据之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 文本语义与光谱-空间数据的融合为语义增强的高光谱图像分类模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAGUL框架，一种轻量级的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露私有敏感信息，需要有效的遗忘机制来解决隐私保护问题。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力识别视觉token的重要性，通过外部模块在低重要性视觉token中编码遗忘信息，而不改变预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法性能优于或与微调基线相当，能有效防止信息泄露并保持参考模型行为。

Conclusion: CAGUL是一种实用有效的VLM遗忘解决方案，无需重新训练成本，不改变预训练模型参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaSC算法，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型从无人机RGB图像自动计数玉米幼苗，支持两种处理模式：拼接图像分块和原始视频帧对齐，在V2-V10生长期准确区分玉米与杂草，实现行级精确计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工计数玉米株数劳动密集、效率低且易出错，特别是在大面积或变化大的田间，需要自动化解决方案来支持作物管理和研究。

Method: 使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长期玉米幼苗，通过两种模式处理：拼接图像分块和原始视频帧对齐，基于检测结果进行行和范围分割实现精确计数。

Result: 与田间人工计数对比显示强相关性（拼接图像R²=0.616，原始帧R²=0.906），处理83帧全分辨率图像仅需60.63秒，具备实时操作潜力。

Conclusion: MaSC是一个可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米株数计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet（QCN）作为CapsNet的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但准确率略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet在检测重叠数字和对抗仿射变换方面优于传统CNN，但训练和测试速度慢，限制了其在需要快速网络的实时应用中的使用。

Method: 通过减少胶囊数量来构建更快的网络，并采用更强大的解码器来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上推理速度提升5倍，但准确率有轻微损失。

Conclusion: QCN是开发快速实时CapsNet应用的良好起点，在保持大部分准确性的同时显著提升了速度。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Rectified-CFG++，一种自适应预测器-校正器引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过几何感知的条件规则确保轨迹在数据流形附近保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG在整流流模型中使用时会导致严重的离流形漂移，产生视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要一种更稳定的引导方法。

Method: 采用自适应预测器-校正器引导，每个推理步骤先执行条件RF更新将样本锚定在学习到的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正，在条件和无条件速度场之间插值。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文生图模型上，Rectified-CFG++在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic、T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上一致优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++将整流流的确定性效率与几何感知条件相结合，确保了速度场的边际一致性和轨迹在数据流形有界管状邻域内的稳定性，在广泛引导强度下保持稳定性能。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PIT-QMM，一种能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云的新型大模型，用于无参考点云质量评估，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了进展，但在3D资产质量评估领域尚未充分探索，特别是无参考点云质量评估仍面临挑战。

Method: 利用文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图等不同模态数据的互补信息，构建能够端到端处理多模态输入的PIT-QMM模型。

Result: 在流行基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，且训练迭代次数更少，同时还能实现失真定位和识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

### [14] [Dual-Stream Alignment for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07652)
*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DSA Net双流对齐网络，通过结合动作特征流来提升动作分割性能，首次引入混合量子-经典机器学习框架，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作分割方法主要关注单流时空建模，但双流方法能学习动作特征来提升分割性能。本文旨在研究引入第二个动作特征流对分割性能的影响。

Method: 提出Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net)，包含帧级流和动作级流，通过Temporal Context块进行信息融合，使用交叉注意力和量子动作引导调制(Q-ActGM)，并通过双流对齐损失实现特征对齐。

Result: 在GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads和EgoProcel等多个基准数据集上评估，DSA Net实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DSA Net通过双流特征对齐和混合量子-经典框架有效提升了动作分割性能，证明了引入动作特征流和量子调制的重要性。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

TL;DR: 提出OIE方法，基于首帧服装替换的视频虚拟试穿策略，通过图像模型替换首帧服装，然后利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型合成后续帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net的双分支架构在扩散模型中成功，但难以适应基于Diffusion Transformer的模型。引入服装参考分支的潜在空间特征需要修改骨干网络，参数量大，且服装特征缺乏时间特性需要额外学习。

Method: 使用图像服装转移模型替换首帧服装，在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型按顺序合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明该方法在参数效率和计算效率方面表现优异，同时在约束条件下保持领先性能。

Conclusion: OIE方法有效解决了基于Diffusion Transformer的视频虚拟试穿挑战，实现了高效且高性能的服装替换。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

TL;DR: 提出一种使用IP-Adapter自动生成掩码的方法，在推理过程中通过二次处理将图像标记限制在主体区域，让文本提示能够更好地控制背景内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化扩散模型在生成图像时倾向于重现主体图像而忽略文本提示，需要提高文本提示的控制能力。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成主体分割掩码，在第二次处理中应用掩码限制图像标记到主体区域，使文本提示能够关注图像的其他部分。

Result: 对于描述位置和地点的文本提示，该方法能准确描绘主体同时精确匹配提示，相比其他方法显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 提出的掩码二次处理方法有效提升了文本提示在个性化扩散模型中的控制能力，实现了更好的主体保持和提示匹配效果。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)解决金字塔网络中解剖结构错位累积问题，并通过双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学影像数据集上实现优于现有方法的配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现出色，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像变形需求下的迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 提出特征增强残差模块(FERM)作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征和估计最终变形场。同时提出双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在精度上优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数规模。

Conclusion: TCIP模型通过FERM和TCI的有效集成，显著提升了医学图像配准的精度和适应性，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，而实际视频工作流程需要混合不同粒度的用户控制，从精确的4D对象轨迹和相机路径到粗略的文本提示。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推断来近似组合分布，使用多个视频生成骨干网络；通过逐步KL散度最小化解决优化挑战，并提出上下文条件分解技术减少解空间模式以避免局部最优。

Result: 实验表明，该方法相比先前工作产生了具有更好可控性、多样性和3D一致性的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效平衡视频生成中的控制精度和多样性需求，为混合粒度控制提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model

that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中心的方法在捕捉全局数据分布方面表现优异，但往往忽视了重要的局部相似性信息，导致性能受限。

Method: 构建双分支结构：强中心分支和弱配对分支，通过迭代相互学习和混合哈希专家模块实现跨分支知识交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MLH一致优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架有效结合了全局和局部信息，通过相互学习机制显著提升了深度哈希的性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter在电商图像修复任务中表现出色，特别是在复杂构图场景下，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SyncHuman展示了未来3D生成模型的一个有前景的方向，通过整合2D和3D生成模型的互补优势实现了高质量重建。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

TL;DR: 提出了ComGS框架，通过表面八面体探针(SOPs)实现可重光照的3D物体重建和场景光照估计，解决了高斯泼溅中物体-场景组合的不一致性问题，实现高质量实时渲染。


<details>

Motivation: 高斯泼溅(GS)虽然能实现沉浸式渲染，但在3D物体-场景组合时存在挑战，因为烘焙的外观和阴影信息会导致不一致。需要可重光照的物体重建和场景光照估计来解决这个问题。

Conclusion: ComGS框架成功解决了高斯泼溅中物体-场景组合的挑战，通过高效的SOPs和简化的光照估计方法，实现了高质量的实时渲染和快速编辑。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UltraLED框架，仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像实现超高动态范围重建，通过曝光校正和亮度感知RAW去噪来恢复暗区细节，避免重影和运动模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大的问题，传统RGB包围曝光方法容易产生重影和对齐问题，而单帧短曝光RAW图像具有更高位深和可预测噪声特性，更适合UHD重建。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围；2）使用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复。构建9档包围曝光流程合成真实UHDR图像数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明UltraLED显著优于现有单帧方法，能够有效恢复暗区细节同时保留高光信息。

Conclusion: 仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量的UHDR重建，该方法在动态场景中具有鲁棒性，避免了传统多帧方法的重影问题。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低帧率RGB视频和高帧率事件流来重建动态3D高斯泼溅的方法，通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，解决了大帧间运动带来的不确定性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机可以异步捕捉快速视觉变化且对运动模糊具有鲁棒性，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中的运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3) 使用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据能有效优化动态3D高斯泼溅。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化RGB和事件模态，利用事件运动先验指导变形场，成功解决了低帧率视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅的挑战，实现了更好的重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

### [28] [GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791)
*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GTR-Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在地理时空推理方面的能力，特别是针对大规模摄像头网络中移动目标的分析。测试显示当前最先进模型与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注以自我为中心的图像/视频推理或基于图形的地理推理，缺乏结合图像/视频和图形上下文的地理时空智能评估，这对交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在地图和视频之间进行多视角切换，跨多个非重叠视野视频进行联合推理，并对视频未观测到的时空区域进行推断。

Result: 评估10多个流行VLM，发现即使最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro（34.9%）也显著落后于人类表现（78.61%）。分析揭示三个主要缺陷：时空上下文利用不平衡、时间预测能力弱、地图与多视角视频理解对齐能力不足。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了有价值的见解和新机遇，揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理方面的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法通常只计算起始到顶点帧的光流，忽略了顶点到结束阶段的运动信息，这限制了识别性能。

Method: 提出了MM-COF运动表示方法，整合两个阶段的运动动态；设计了FMANet端到端神经网络，内部化双阶段分析和幅度调制为可学习模块。

Result: 在MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II和SAMM四个标准数据集上的实验表明，所提方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 可学习的双阶段框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: 提出的基于房间几何约束的深度估计框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，通过整合几何信息显著提升了深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

TL;DR: ACAVP通过引入仿射变换和颜色变换增强视觉提示的表达能力，结合TrivialAugment数据增强解决过拟合问题，在12个图像分类数据集上达到SOTA精度，超越线性探测并保持低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达力受限和过拟合问题，导致精度低于其他适应方法。

Method: 提出ACAVP方法，结合仿射变换（保留原始信息）、颜色变换（强调任务特征）和加法变换，并使用TrivialAugment数据增强防止过拟合。

Result: 在12个数据集上达到视觉提示方法的SOTA精度，平均精度超越线性探测，对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性，推理计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强显著提升了视觉提示的性能，证明了适当的数据增强对视觉提示训练具有普适性益处。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景中经常出现多人多物体的复杂交互，但现有3D人-物交互基准只考虑了部分简单交互，需要更全面的测试平台。

Method: 开发了MMHOI-Net端到端transformer网络，使用结构化双补丁表示建模物体及其交互，结合动作识别增强交互预测。

Result: 在MMHOI和CORE4D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多HOI建模中达到最先进性能，在准确性和重建质量方面表现出色。

Conclusion: MMHOI数据集和MMHOI-Net框架为下一代HOI研究提供了全面测试平台，能够有效建模复杂的多人多物体交互场景。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS是一个基于物理正则化的框架，通过金字塔多尺度监督和显式尺寸正则化，解决了3D高斯溅射在大规模城市场景中的走样问题和优化不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在紧凑场景中实现了实时逼真渲染，但在大规模城市场景中会出现严重的走样伪影和优化不稳定问题，特别是在高分辨率渲染下。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性问题，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Method: PrismGS集成了两个协同的正则化器：金字塔多尺度监督（通过监督渲染与预滤波图像金字塔的一致性来强制学习抗锯齿表示）和显式尺寸正则化（对3D高斯的尺寸施加物理基础的下界约束，防止形成退化的视图相关基元）。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的广泛实验表明，PrismGS实现了最先进的性能，相比CityGaussian获得了约1.5 dB的PSNR增益，同时在苛刻的4K渲染下保持了优越的质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的兼容现有管道的框架，通过物理基础的正则化显著提高了3D高斯的内在渲染行为，解决了大规模城市场景中的走样和稳定性问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Conclusion: 提出的端到端框架能够有效实现手语视频到语音的直接翻译，在孤立手语序列翻译任务中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Method: 提出了AlignGS框架，通过深度一致性和多面法向正则化等新颖的语义到几何指导机制，从2D基础模型中提取丰富先验知识来直接正则化3D表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的结果，并产生了具有优越几何精度的重建结果。

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器可以从有限的输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的参考检测。

Conclusion: 所提出的ERU框架能够有效处理复杂或杂乱环境中的歧义问题，提升具身参考理解的性能。

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

*Peiran Wu,Zhuorui Yu,Yunze Liu,Chi-Hao Wu,Enmin Zhou,Junxiao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MARC方法，通过结构化检索和强化学习蒸馏，实现视频token压缩95%，在保持接近基准准确率的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型扩展到视频时面临高计算成本问题，现有训练无关的token压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: 采用检索-压缩策略：使用视觉记忆检索器选择关键片段，通过压缩组相对策略优化框架将教师模型的推理能力蒸馏到学生模型。

Result: 在6个视频基准测试中，仅使用一帧token即可达到接近基准准确率，视觉token减少95%，GPU内存减少72%，延迟降低23.9%。

Conclusion: MARC在资源受限场景下具有高效实时视频理解的潜力，适用于视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等应用。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索机制，通过世界模型想象未来导航状态作为查询，选择性检索相关环境观察和行为历史，显著提升了视觉语言导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持续性视觉语言导航方法存在关键局限：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，依赖整个记忆整合或固定范围查找，且主要存储环境观察而忽略了编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器集成检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持续性VLN基准上，Memoir在所有场景均显著提升，IR2R上比最佳记忆持续性基线SPL提升5.4%，同时训练速度加快8.3倍，推理内存减少74%。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆可实现更有效的导航，想象力引导范式仍有巨大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

Motivation: 异常检测在制造业质量控制中很重要，但受限于异常样本少和标注成本高。现有研究将异常合成作为异常检测的辅助组件，缺乏系统评估，且忽略了关键因素如解耦影响、定量分析和跨场景适应性。

Method: 提出ASBench基准框架，包含四个评估维度：(i)跨数据集和管道的泛化性能；(ii)合成与真实数据比例；(iii)合成图像内在指标与异常检测性能指标的相关性；(iv)混合异常合成方法策略。

Conclusion: ASBench填补了异常合成方法系统评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要基准和指导方向。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

TL;DR: 提出ResAD框架解决端到端自动驾驶中的轨迹数据时空不平衡问题，通过预测相对于惯性参考的残差偏差来改进模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有的时空不平衡问题，这导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，并优先考虑不确定的远距离预测，从而危及即时安全

Method: ResAD框架采用归一化残差轨迹建模，预测相对于确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，并使用逐点归一化处理优化不平衡问题

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅有两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最先进PDMS分数

Conclusion: 该方法显著简化了学习任务并提高了模型性能，证明了通过残差建模和归一化处理可以有效解决轨迹预测中的优化不平衡问题

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: TTOM是一个无需训练的视频生成框架，通过测试时优化和记忆机制来提升视频基础模型在组合场景下的表现，实现更好的文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在视觉生成方面表现优异，但在组合场景（如运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进文本-图像对齐能力。

Method: 提出TTOM框架：1）在推理时通过布局注意力目标优化新参数；2）采用流式视频生成设置；3）使用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文，支持插入、读取、更新和删除操作。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中，TTOM被证明是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: TTOM能够解耦组合性世界知识，展现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力，为组合视频生成提供了有效的实时跨模态对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效改进降水临近预报性能，无需推理时额外开销，结合了确定性和概率模型的优势。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像修复框架，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制高频感知重建来重新定义VAE，在保持计算效率的同时恢复高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD图像修复面临计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡，传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段：LH-VAE通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建；第二阶段：使用HF-LoRA联合训练，包含编码器LoRA（保真度导向的高频对齐损失）和解码器LoRA（感知导向的损失），通过交替优化和选择性梯度传播保持预训练潜在结构。

Result: 实验表明Latent Harmony在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony通过重新定义VAE和引入HF-LoRA机制，成功解决了UHD图像修复中效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，实现了灵活的质量控制。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在图像隐私这一上下文相关且主观的任务中，对象标签和抽象标签哪种更适合。对象标签表示具体实体，而抽象标签捕捉更高层次的上下文信息。

Method: 比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的效果，分析不同标签数量下的性能差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；当每个图像可用标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

Motivation: 解决低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复与严重噪声抑制的挑战，同时探索性能与计算效率之间的关键权衡，为实际应用提供更实用的解决方案。

Method: 通过实验对比最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级CNN模型，在低光图像恢复任务上进行性能与效率的全面评估。

Result: SwinIR达到最高性能（PSNR 39.03 dB），但轻量级CNN表现惊人地接近（PSNR 37.4 dB），且CNN仅需10个训练周期，模型大小比SwinIR小55倍以上。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能以显著更低的计算开销提供接近SOTA的结果，在资源受限的实际场景中具有更强的实用性。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型的组合图像检索方法存在"黑箱"问题，用户无法理解检索原理，且模型难以遵循复杂细粒度的指令。

Method: 引入思维链推理机制，通过三阶段过程（描述、推理、结论）生成结构化标注，然后微调模型产生结构化输出，最后将检索意图编码到专用嵌入中。

Result: CIR-CoT在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上表现优异，在领域外CIRCO数据集上展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理提高了检索准确性和透明度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Conclusion: RayFusion通过射线融合有效提升了纯相机协作感知系统的检测性能，为解决深度估计模糊性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is
available at https://github.com/wangsh0111/RayFusion.

TL;DR: 提出RASALoRE：一种新颖的两阶段弱监督脑部MRI异常检测框架，通过区域感知空间注意力和基于位置的随机嵌入实现高效异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑部MRI扫描中弱监督异常检测的挑战，当精确的像素级标注不可用而只有切片级弱标签可用时，需要快速准确的脑部异常检测方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用判别式双提示调优机制生成高质量伪弱掩码；第二阶段使用具有区域感知空间注意力的分割网络，依赖基于位置的固定随机嵌入。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上实现了最先进的异常检测性能，显著优于现有WSAD方法，同时使用少于800万参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升，为弱监督脑部异常检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetouchLLM是一个无需训练的白盒图像润色系统，通过代码生成直接在原始图像上执行可解释的润色操作，模仿人类多步骤润色过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，润色过程不透明，难以适应多样化的用户或图像特定调整需求。

Method: 系统包含视觉批评器（识别输入图像与参考图像差异）和代码生成器（生成可执行代码），通过自然语言交互实现渐进式图像增强。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好地泛化到不同润色风格，自然语言交互实现了基于用户意图的可解释和可控调整。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释且可控的图像润色解决方案，能够适应多样化的用户偏好和调整需求。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多时序类别驱动的层次化ResNet网络，用于多光谱图像时间序列在不同语义层次上的分类，通过引入层次惩罚映射和分支结构来提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多光谱图像时间序列分类中不同语义层次类别的区分问题，特别是在训练样本有限的情况下，需要一种能够有效利用类别层次结构信息的方法。

Method: 修改ResNet架构，引入额外分支进行不同层次分类，使用层次惩罚映射避免不合理的层次转换，通过类别层次标签高效训练网络各层。

Result: 在2019年亚马逊森林12个月Sentinel 2图像上的实验表明，该方法能在不同层次上泛化良好，在微观类别水平实现准确分类，并更好地表示少数类别。

Conclusion: 所提出的模块化网络具有内在适应能力，通过微调可在新目标区域获得准确的微观类别分类，有效改善了少数类别的表示。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测的学术评估和基准测试缺乏针对性、深度伪造多样性有限、操作技术受限，无法有效应用于现实世界场景。

Method: 使用9个商业在线平台生成深度伪造内容，采用定制算法合成，捕捉真实世界深度伪造创作者的多样化和演进方法。

Conclusion: RedFace通过模拟真实世界黑盒场景，填补了学术评估与现实需求之间的差距，为深度伪造检测提供了更有效的基准测试。

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

Conclusion: 基于物理原理的NSG-VD方法能有效检测AI生成视频，通过概率流守恒原理捕捉自然视频与生成视频的分布差异，为AI生成内容检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无数据条件下的深度哈希后门攻击，在保持原始检索精度的同时实现了强大的攻击效果，并能抵抗现有防御方法。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析精度不足的问题，因为此类姿态的标注数据有限且人工标注成本高昂。

Method: 联合拟合两个3DGS模型（分别针对RGB图像和初始分割图），通过共享几何实现多视角一致性，生成姿态多样化的训练数据。

Result: 在具有挑战性的头部姿态上显著提高了人脸解析精度，同时在标准视角下保持良好性能，无需真实3D标注且仅使用少量初始图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升真实场景中人脸解析的鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 随机窗宽窗位是一种有效的CT特定增强技术，能够提高深度学习模型在肝脏肿瘤分割任务中的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: AR-Drag是第一个RL增强的少步自回归视频扩散模型，能够实现实时图像到视频生成，具有高质量和精确运动控制能力。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种注意力增强方法TCAS，通过提高视频语言模型中跨模态注意力头的时间分辨能力，解决模型对重述问题产生逻辑不一致响应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象表现为模型无法基于其基础输出对重述问题提供逻辑一致的响应，但这种现象的根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结并干预该现象的潜在因素。提出了一种称为时间条件注意力锐化(TCAS)的注意力增强方法，该方法基于注意力差异构建增强目标，以增强模型的时间分辨能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性。可解释性分析显示该方法确实提高了注意力头的时间区分能力。此外，在一般视频时间定位任务中实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解中的一个瓶颈。通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为多模态视频超分辨率提供了统一的解决方案，实现了之前无法达到的4K视频生成能力。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态推理显著提升了图像编辑的精度和效果，为复杂视觉编辑任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

### [68] [InstructUDrag: Joint Text Instructions and Object Dragging for Interactive Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08181)
*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag是一个结合文本指令和对象拖拽的扩散模型框架，能够同时进行对象拖拽和基于文本的图像编辑，解决了传统方法在精确定位和静态重定位方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本编辑方法难以精确定位对象，而对象拖拽方法仅限于静态重定位。为了同时实现精确的对象定位和语义控制，需要结合两种方法的优势。

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导精确移动对象，文本驱动编辑分支共享梯度信号实现一致变换。采用DDPM反演和噪声图先验信息注入来保持对象结构。

Result: 实验表明InstructUDrag能够实现灵活、高保真的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: InstructUDrag成功结合了文本指令和对象拖拽的优势，为图像编辑提供了更精确和灵活的控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

TL;DR: FineDual是一个三阶段的双人运动生成方法，通过建模动态分层交互从个体到个体间，生成细粒度的双人运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法几乎以时间不变的方式建模人类交互，忽略了距离和层次结构，而人类交互本质上是动态和分层的。

Method: 三阶段方法：自学习阶段通过LLM将双人整体文本分解为个体文本；自适应调整阶段预测交互距离并使用交互感知图网络建模；教师引导精炼阶段使用整体文本特征指导运动特征精炼。

Result: 在双人运动数据集上的广泛定量和定性评估表明，FineDual优于现有方法，有效建模动态分层的人类交互。

Conclusion: FineDual通过建模动态分层交互，能够生成细粒度和高质量的双人运动，解决了现有方法忽略距离和层次结构的问题。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于遥感图像单正多标签学习的自适应梯度校准框架AdaGC，通过梯度校准机制和双EMA模块生成鲁棒伪标签，在两种标签噪声类型下均达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像的多标签分类比单标签分类能提供更全面的语义理解，但获取完整标注成本高昂。单正多标签学习(SPML)作为实用替代方案，每个图像只标注一个相关标签，但现有SPML方法在遥感领域研究有限。

Method: 提出AdaGC框架，包含梯度校准机制、Mixup技术和双指数移动平均模块，通过训练动态自适应触发梯度校准，有效缓解对标签噪声的过拟合。

Result: 在两个基准遥感数据集上的广泛实验表明，AdaGC在两种不同标签噪声类型下均实现了最先进的性能，并在多样化设置中保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGC为遥感图像的单正多标签学习提供了一个新颖且通用的解决方案，通过自适应梯度校准有效解决了监督模糊性问题，在多种噪声环境下均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NTN-Diff方法，通过频率感知的零文本扩散模型解决文本引导图像修复中的语义一致性和未掩码区域保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决未掩码区域保护和掩码/未掩码区域语义一致性这两个挑战，这源于混合频率带在去噪过程中对文本提示的不同鲁棒性。

Method: 将去噪过程分为早期（高级噪声）和晚期（低级噪声）阶段，在去噪过程中解耦中低频带。使用稳定的中频带作为指导，通过零文本去噪过程处理掩码区域的低频带。

Result: 大量实验验证了NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中的优越性。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率感知的零文本扩散模型，成功解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战，实现了掩码与未掩码区域的语义一致性，同时保护了未掩码区域。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Neural Exposure Fields (NExF)，一种从具有强曝光变化的真实世界数据中鲁棒重建3D场景的新方法，通过预测每个3D点的最佳曝光值来实现高质量视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示方法在处理包含强曝光变化的数据时（如室内外混合场景或带窗户的房间），输出质量会下降，需要解决3D场景中曝光不一致的问题。

Method: 学习预测每个3D点最佳曝光值的神经场，通过神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场，在3D空间而非图像层面进行曝光优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试上取得最先进结果，比最佳基线方法提升超过55%，训练速度更快，能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图。

Conclusion: NExF能够从具有挑战性的真实世界数据中鲁棒重建3D场景，无需后处理或多曝光捕获，实现了高质量的3D一致外观重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过稀疏局部注意力和全局查询来平衡局部性和全局性，在四个参考视频分割基准上达到了新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参考视频分割（RVOS）中现有方法无法在局部性和全局性之间取得良好平衡，且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加的问题。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力，使用扩张窗口注意力聚合局部上下文信息；2）让每个查询关注从全局池中随机选择的一小组键来增强全局性；3）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互以直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个参考视频分割基准上达到新的最先进水平，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制有效平衡了局部性和全局性，显著提升了参考视频分割的性能，同时控制了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义基础的学习范式，通过跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)将2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，并设计了跨模态功能分割转换器(CAST)来生成精确的提示感知分割图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D功能分割方法使用点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽视了3D数据的固有挑战（如稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性），导致学习到的3D特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 1. 提出跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，并联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；2. 设计跨模态功能分割转换器(CAST)，集成多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D功能分割方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过将2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，能够有效解决3D功能分割中的语义边界模糊问题，显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的无数据后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来加速视频扩散模型，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但由于其表达能力有限和视频生成的时空建模复杂性，完全替换需要昂贵的预训练。

Method: 提出选择性转移方法，将层选择视为二分类问题，自动渐进地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配（ADM）目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍的加速，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现了15.92倍的延迟减少，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效地解决了视频扩散模型的计算效率问题，通过智能层选择和高效的分布匹配目标，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是在安全关键应用中。由于关键交通对象通常距离较远，需要系统具备远距离感知能力，而现有小规模VLMs在这方面的表现尚未充分评估。

Method: 创建了DTPQA基准测试，包含仅需感知能力的问题，并添加距离标注。评估了多种最先进的小规模VLMs在该基准上的表现，并与人类性能对比。

Result: 最佳小规模VLM的平均准确率约为60%，远低于人类约85%的表现。模型在特定感知任务（如区分左右）上表现尤其困难。

Conclusion: 当前小规模VLMs在纯感知任务上仍显著落后于人类，特别是在远距离感知和方向辨别等关键任务上，这限制了它们在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater

distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，本文旨在将统一建模扩展到视频领域，解决复杂多模态指令理解和视觉一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用双流设计：多模态大语言模型（MLLM）负责理解多模态指令，多模态DiT（MMDiT）负责视频生成。通过联合训练统一处理文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等任务。

Result: 实验表明UniVideo在各项任务上达到或超越了最先进的特定任务基线模型，支持任务组合和跨任务泛化，能够处理未见过的编辑指令。

Conclusion: UniVideo成功将统一多模态建模扩展到视频领域，展示了强大的任务组合能力和泛化性能，为未来视频生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于课程学习的源自由域自适应框架LFC，通过从易到难和从源到目标的课程设计，在无需源数据的情况下实现医学图像的域自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像数据隐私和安全问题，现有源自由域自适应方法主要关注伪标签优化而忽略了学习过程，渐进式学习能更好地促进知识迁移。

Method: 设计双重课程学习：从易到难课程从简单样本开始学习并逐步增加难度；从源到目标课程确保模型从源域到目标域的平稳迁移。

Result: 在眼底分割和息肉分割的跨域数据集上评估，实验结果表明该方法超越了现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了源自由域自适应问题，在医学图像分割任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: VideoVerse是一个新的文本到视频生成基准测试，专注于评估模型对现实世界中复杂时间因果关系和世界知识的理解能力，填补了现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成基准测试存在三个主要问题：1) 现有评估维度无法区分最先进的模型；2) 事件级时间因果关系评估严重不足；3) 缺乏对世界知识的系统性评估。这些问题使得现有基准无法有效评估构建世界模型所需的关键能力。

Method: 收集跨多个领域（自然景观、体育、室内场景、科幻、化学物理实验等）的代表性视频，提取具有固有时间因果关系的事件级描述，由独立标注者重写为文本到视频提示。为每个提示设计包含动态和静态属性的二元评估问题，共定义十个评估维度。最终包含300个精心策划的提示，涉及815个事件和793个评估问题。

Result: 开发了基于现代视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐的问答评估流程，并对最先进的开源和闭源文本到视频模型进行了系统性评估。

Conclusion: VideoVerse基准测试为评估文本到视频模型在理解复杂时间因果关系和世界知识方面的能力提供了全面框架，有助于分析当前文本到视频生成器与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

### [83] [Large Scale Diffusion Distillation via Score-Regularized Continuous-Time Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08431)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到通用应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过结合分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，在保持高生成多样性的同时显著提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速方面理论严谨且经验强大，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不清楚，主要面临Jacobian-vector乘积计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发了并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP内核，支持超过100亿参数模型和高维视频任务训练。提出rCM模型，将分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器集成到sCM中，结合"模式覆盖"的前向散度和"模式寻求"的反向散度。

Result: 在高达140亿参数的Cosmos-Predict2、Wan2.1等大规模模型和5秒视频上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，仅需1-4步即可生成高保真样本，加速扩散采样15-50倍。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础扎实的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化的空间图像处理框架，包含灰度量化、色彩亮度增强、图像锐化、双向变换管道和几何特征提取等功能，在多个数据集上表现出稳健的确定性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个集成的图像处理框架，能够同时处理多种图像处理任务，包括简化表示、增强对比度、提高细节清晰度以及提取几何特征，以满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化方法：灰度量化将图像分为8个离散级别；在RGB和YCrCb色彩空间进行直方图均衡化；通过HSV值通道调整亮度；使用3×3卷积核进行图像锐化；构建包含反锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大的双向变换管道；应用Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测和形态学窗口定位进行几何特征提取。

Result: 双向变换管道的正向和反向过程准确率分别达到76.10%和74.80%；Hough线估计成功检测到51.50°的台球杆对齐角度；球杆隔离与真实图像的相似度达到81.87%；在多样化数据集上表现出稳健的确定性性能。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架在图像处理任务中表现出色，具有实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的潜力，证明了其在简化表示、增强视觉效果和提取几何特征方面的有效性。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉和文本推理方面表现出色，但依赖文本中心先验限制了其在开放词汇场景中区分语义相似动作的能力。

Method: 将动作分解为可区分的子动作进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交错，设计分层奖励平衡工具使用效率、子动作相关性和推理结构连贯性。

Result: 在HMDB-51、UCF-101、SSv2、Kinetics-400和Kinetics-600数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法在区分细粒度动作和处理跨模态幻觉方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-STAR框架通过子动作分解和工具增强强化学习，有效提升了开放词汇动作识别的性能，验证了其优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于视频的视觉象似性挑战基准，评估视觉语言模型在手语象似性任务上的表现，包括音系形式预测、透明度和象似性评级，发现模型表现低于人类基线，但模型在音系形式预测上的能力与人类象似性判断相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（语言形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，旨在评估视觉语言模型从动态人类动作而非静态上下文中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型在三个任务上的表现：音系手语形式预测、透明度和分级象似性评级，在荷兰手语上进行零样本和少样本测试。

Result: 在音系形式预测上，模型能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务上远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评级呈中等相关。有趣的是，音系形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 研究验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并表明需要人类中心信号和具身学习方法，以建模象似性并改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉理解方面表现出色，但将其与扩散模型集成用于编辑任务（特别是视频编辑）仍面临挑战，且缺乏对MLLM设计选择的深入分析。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够处理广泛的图像和视频编辑任务，并达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 图像数据训练可以产生涌现的视频编辑能力，缓解视频训练数据稀缺的问题；通过模态特定的MLLM特征可以有效统一图像和视频编辑任务。

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件而遭受复杂退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真），现有方法需要专业手动选择或单一架构难以泛化到不同退化类型。

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率视频退化识别基准，使用视觉语言模型(VLM)驱动退化识别器；引入基于大语言模型(LLM)的自适应路由器，通过观察工具使用模式学习有效修复策略；构建Res-VQ数据集并设计专用VLM视频质量评估模型。

Result: 广泛实验表明，MoA-VR能有效处理多样化和复合退化，在客观指标和感知质量方面持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了在多模态智能和模块化推理集成在通用视频修复系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇标记，在各种LVLM和视觉推理任务上都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇在增强视觉推理方面具有未开发的潜力，应被更充分地利用。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Motivation: 为参数高效微调（PEFT）提供理论基础，解释为什么仅更新预训练模型中的小子网络就能获得良好性能。

Method: 提出SliceFine方法，仅更新原始权重中的选定切片，不引入新参数，利用预训练模型固有的冗余性。

Result: SliceFine在语言和视觉任务上达到最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时显著提高训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了理论与实践，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论基础的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Motivation: 现有的图像到视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，需要开发一个能够支持多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制的统一框架。

Method: 引入统一的基于点运动表示（分割ID、时间一致轨迹ID、可选颜色通道），采用高效的序列拼接方案而非标记拼接或ControlNet，并使用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督和对齐条件的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明FlexTraj能够实现多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，支持运动克隆、基于拖拽的图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向、灵活动作控制和网格动画等多种应用。

Conclusion: FlexTraj提供了一个强大而灵活的框架，通过统一的点轨迹表示和高效的训练策略，实现了对视频生成中轨迹控制的精确和多粒度操控。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接学习空间推理而缺乏层次化的感知和理解基础，导致性能受限。

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，采用三阶段渐进训练：空间感知（目标定位）、空间理解（多维空间任务）、复杂推理（强化学习）。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning

*Rishubh Parihar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,R. Venkatesh Babu,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kuan-Chieh Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kontinuous Kontext是一个指令驱动的图像编辑模型，通过引入标量编辑强度参数，实现对编辑程度的连续精细控制，从无变化到完全实现编辑结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑方法仅依赖文本指令，缺乏对编辑程度的精细控制。需要一种能够连续调整编辑强度的方法。

Method: 扩展最先进的图像编辑模型，增加标量编辑强度输入，训练轻量级投影网络将标量和编辑指令映射到模型的调制空间系数。使用生成模型合成图像-编辑-指令-强度四元组数据集进行训练。

Result: 模型能够实现从细微到强烈的编辑控制，适用于风格化、属性、材质、背景和形状等多种编辑操作，无需特定属性训练。

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext提供了一种统一的精细编辑控制方法，显著提升了指令驱动图像编辑的灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: 本文针对多模态大语言模型在长链反思推理能力上的不足，构建了MM-HELIX基准测试，并提出自适应混合策略优化方法，显著提升了模型在复杂推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务上表现出色，但在需要迭代思考和回溯的长链反思推理能力方面仍有明显不足，这是解决复杂现实问题的关键能力。

Method: 首先构建MM-HELIX多模态基准测试，包含1,260个需要迭代推理的挑战性任务。然后开发步骤引导响应生成流程创建MM-HELIX-100K数据集，并提出自适应混合策略优化方法，动态结合离线监督和在线优化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基准模型上，该方法在MM-HELIX基准上实现了+18.6%的准确率提升，在通用数学和逻辑任务上平均性能提升+5.7%。

Conclusion: 研究表明多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以有效学习和泛化，为开发更强大的多模态模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段与规范对的文化基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖中美文化背景下的社会文化规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集，使用基于理论提示的教师模型提供候选标注，由训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 基准测试显示模型在规范违反检测、中国文化理解、非语言证据提供和正式场景表现等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，该基准和框架开始填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临保真度与效率的权衡：逐场景优化计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，配合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，采用分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略。

Result: 在8个室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO提供交互性能、鲁棒性和接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: 为实时数字化真实世界环境提供实用路径，兼具准确几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

TL;DR: 提出了VideoCanvas框架，通过混合条件策略解决因果VAE的时间模糊问题，实现任意时空视频补全的统一范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成任务（如图像到视频、修复、扩展、插值）相互独立，缺乏统一的灵活控制框架。因果VAE的时间模糊性阻碍了精确的帧级控制。

Method: 采用零参数增加的上下文条件范式，通过零填充处理空间控制，通过时间RoPE插值实现时间对齐，解耦时空控制。

Result: 在VideoCanvasBench基准测试中显著优于现有条件范式，建立了灵活统一视频生成的新技术水平。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas成功解决了因果VAE的时间模糊问题，为任意时空视频补全提供了统一且灵活的控制框架。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Conclusion: SciVideoBench填补了科学视频推理评估的关键空白，为LMMs未来发展提供了宝贵见解和明确方向，推动真正有能力多模态AI科学助手的发展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态控制视频插帧框架在灵活性、易用性和精度之间取得了平衡，能够满足复杂的视频编辑需求

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Motivation: 现有MLLM采用组合式训练范式，但多模态缩放特性难以探索。本文旨在研究原生端到端训练的MLLM，在数据约束条件下系统分析其设计空间和缩放特性。

Method: 系统研究MLLM的各种设计选择，找到平衡性能和训练成本的最佳元架构，探索视觉编码器与LLM之间的缩放关系，提出NaViL原生MLLM及简单高效训练方法。

Result: 发现视觉编码器与LLM之间存在正相关的缩放关系，NaViL在14个多模态基准测试中展现出与现有MLLM竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来原生MLLM研究提供了深入见解，证明了原生端到端训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在稀疏视角条件下显著提升了视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视角下3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，提高了重建质量和稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Conclusion: MATRIX框架展示了可扩展且有效的多模态工具使用方法，为视觉语言模型的工具使用推理提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

TL;DR: ReSplat是一种前馈循环高斯泼溅模型，通过迭代优化3D高斯而不显式计算梯度，利用渲染误差作为反馈信号，在减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯泼溅模型虽然计算效率高且能处理稀疏输入，但由于推理时仅依赖单次前向传播，性能受到根本限制。

Method: 提出循环高斯泼溅模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新；引入紧凑重建模型在16倍降采样空间初始化，大幅减少高斯数量。

Result: 在多种输入视图(2,8,16)、分辨率(256×256到540×960)和数据集(DL3DV、RealEstate10K)上的实验表明，该方法在显著减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环优化机制有效提升了高斯泼溅模型的性能，同时保持了计算效率，为3D重建和渲染提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

TL;DR: FLEET是一个混合分散式框架，将自然语言指令转化为优化的多机器人调度方案，结合LLM前端和形式化后端解决异构机器人团队的协调问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构机器人团队从自由形式自然语言指令进行协调的挑战，语言规划器难以处理长期协调和幻觉问题，而纯形式化方法需要封闭世界模型。

Method: 使用LLM前端生成任务图（包含持续时间和优先级）和能力感知的机器人-任务适应度矩阵，形式化后端解决最小化完成时间问题，机器人在闭环控制下执行自由形式的子任务。

Result: 在多个自由形式语言引导的自主协调基准测试中，FLEET在异构任务的两智能体团队上比最先进的生成规划器提高了成功率。消融实验显示MILP主要改善时间结构，LLM衍生的适应度对能力耦合任务至关重要。

Conclusion: FLEET框架成功地将自然语言转化为优化的多机器人调度，在真实世界硬件试验中验证了其有效性，使用具有不相交能力的一对四足机器人。

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language
instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon
coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require
closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that
turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces
(i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware
robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization
problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with
agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy
coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art
generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations
show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal
structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks;
together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the
translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of
quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.

Method: 使用基于门控循环单元的编码器-解码器模型，将车辆未来状态与过去状态测量值和驾驶员控制动作相关联，完全数据驱动且不受物理约束。

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

Conclusion: HJCD-IK在逆运动学求解方面表现出色，提供了开源代码供社区使用。

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint
configurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although
analytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low
degrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical
optimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high
computational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent
efforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to
enhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent
literature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid
solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent
initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design
enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as
compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.
In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,
yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source
for the benefit of the community.

TL;DR: 提出Amortized Value Optimization (AVO)方法，通过引入学习型价值函数来预测未来任务性能，从而在灵巧操作任务中桥接不同接触模式的子任务优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵巧操作任务需要在不同接触模式间切换，传统方法将任务分解为独立优化的子任务，这限制了性能且计算成本高昂。

Method: 引入学习型价值函数预测总未来任务性能，将其纳入轨迹优化成本中，通过价值函数梯度引导优化器朝向有利于后续子任务的状态。

Result: 在螺丝刀抓取和转动任务中验证，即使计算预算减少50%，性能仍优于无价值函数的轨迹优化方法。

Conclusion: AVO方法有效桥接子任务优化，减少在线计算需求，提升灵巧操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.

Motivation: 基础设施老化复杂化使检测规划更关键，现有基于采样的规划器虽快但内存需求大，特别是对于大型复杂结构

Method: 开发IPIM原语计算，让基于采样的检测规划器完全使用神经SDF表示，避免在隐式和显式模型间频繁转换

Result: 在复杂真实结构（9200万三角网格面）上测试，基础规划器使用IPIM可生成与最先进规划器质量相当的轨迹，同时内存使用减少高达70倍

Conclusion: IPIM方法成功实现了基于神经SDF的高效检测规划，显著降低了内存需求

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate
inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the
state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the
state-of-the-art inspection planner.

TL;DR: GATO是一个开源的GPU加速批量轨迹优化求解器，专为中等批量规模（数十到数百个求解）设计，能在机器人应用中实现实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU加速方法要么并行化单个求解以满足实时截止时间，要么以低于实时的速率扩展到非常大的批量，要么通过限制模型通用性来实现速度。这导致许多最先进的MPC应用在需要实时批量求解时存在性能差距。

Method: GATO采用算法、软件和计算硬件的协同设计，利用块级、warp级和线程级并行性在求解内部和跨求解之间实现超高性能。

Result: 模拟基准测试显示，随着批量大小增加，GATO比CPU基线快18-21倍，比GPU基线快1.4-16倍。案例研究显示改善了扰动抑制和收敛行为，并在工业机械臂上进行了硬件验证。

Conclusion: GATO填补了中等批量规模实时求解的性能空白，并通过开源支持可重复性和采用。

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across
robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory
optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing
GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet
real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time
rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass
dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver
performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time
batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open
source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,
software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these
moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,
warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU
baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies
highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and
finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open
source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.

TL;DR: SPaSM是一个完全GPU并行化的框架，通过优化的CUDA内核实现约束评估、采样和梯度优化的端到端轨迹优化，无需CPU协调，在具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了毫秒级的求解时间和100%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序机器人操作任务需要在可能的高维配置空间中寻找满足多个对象交互几何约束的无碰撞轨迹。由于计算需求，实时和大规模解决这些问题一直难以实现。现有的GPU加速方法由于CPU-GPU数据传输开销和复杂逻辑导致性能有限。

Method: SPaSM采用两阶段粒子优化策略：首先通过大规模并行采样解决放置约束，然后将解决方案提升到关节空间中的完整轨迹优化。该方法将约束评估、采样和梯度优化编译为优化的CUDA内核，实现端到端轨迹优化。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，SPaSM实现了毫秒级的求解时间和100%的成功率，相比现有方法实现了4000倍的加速。

Conclusion: SPaSM通过完全GPU并行化和优化的CUDA内核，成功解决了顺序机器人操作任务中的计算瓶颈，实现了实时性能和大规模应用。

Abstract: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require finding collision-free
trajectories that satisfy geometric constraints across multiple object
interactions in potentially high-dimensional configuration spaces. Solving
these problems in real-time and at large scales has remained out of reach due
to computational requirements. Recently, GPU-based acceleration has shown
promising results, but prior methods achieve limited performance due to CPU-GPU
data transfer overhead and complex logic that prevents full hardware
utilization. To this end, we present SPaSM (Sampling Particle optimization for
Sequential Manipulation), a fully GPU-parallelized framework that compiles
constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization into optimized
CUDA kernels for end-to-end trajectory optimization without CPU coordination.
The method consists of a two-stage particle optimization strategy: first
solving placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifting
solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space. Unlike hierarchical
approaches, SPaSM jointly optimizes object placements and robot trajectories to
handle scenarios where motion feasibility constrains placement options.
Experimental evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrates solution times
in the realm of $\textbf{milliseconds}$ with a 100% success rate; a
$4000\times$ speedup compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 基于模型扩散中的约束会导致灾难性性能下降，即使在简单2D系统中也因蒙特卡洛近似得分函数的样本效率低下

Method: 引入新兴障碍函数，使用渐进引入的障碍约束，分析每轮迭代的采样活跃度来指导障碍参数调度选择

Result: 在2D碰撞避免和3D水下机械臂系统中，EB-MBD比基于模型扩散获得更低成本解，比基于投影方法减少数量级计算时间

Conclusion: EB-MBD方法通过渐进障碍约束有效解决约束扩散问题，显著提高解质量且无需昂贵投影操作

Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing
emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that
constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance
degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte
Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier
Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier
constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality,
without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections.
We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier
parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance
and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower
cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude
less computation time than projection based methods.

Conclusion: 提出的规划框架能够有效处理地形不确定性，为双足机器人在粗糙地形上的安全导航提供概率安全保证和动态稳定性。

Abstract: We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个可扩展、统计验证、组件无关且完全互操作的工具集，可以简化和加速自动驾驶安全验证，可能缩短自动驾驶上市时间，并为未来容错和弹性自动驾驶设计研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern
because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures
affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or
software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection
studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,
resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate
into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by
reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort
an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since
hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables
analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how
their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we
propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework
that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source
simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations
were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.
The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of
each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,
such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of
collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress
the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,
component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and
accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and
components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the
foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating

Conclusion: IntentionVLA是下一代人机交互系统的有前景范式，通过赋予模型推理能力实现了更自然的人机交互。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is becoming
increasingly important for training autonomous vehicle systems and building
urban traffic simulations. However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the
Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire slip,
load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our knowledge, no unified,
physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common
MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the "Generalized Micro-mobility Model"
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that
supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation
framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare
the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4
integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory
traces and logging for analysis. We also empirically validate the GM3 on the
Stanford Drone Dataset's deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater, and
cart classes.

Motivation: 现有的基于流的策略存在表示坍塌问题，无法区分相似的视觉表示，导致在精确操作任务中失败。需要一种既能保持一步推理效率又能避免表示坍塌的方法

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，DM1实现20-40倍推理加速（0.07s vs 2-3.5s），成功率提升10-20个百分点，Lift任务达到99%成功率（基线为85%）。在Franka Panda真实机器人上验证了从仿真到物理世界的有效迁移

Conclusion: 这是首个利用表示正则化使基于流的策略在机器人操作中实现强大性能的工作，为高效鲁棒的操作提供了一种简单而强大的方法

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

Abstract: Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,
including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained
communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied
intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous
underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously
performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,
high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these
limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over
561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of
BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from
visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we
propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates
binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and
further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement
module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across
tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,
the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile
manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared
with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that
VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,
providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task

TL;DR: 本文介绍了参加IROS 2025 RoboSense挑战赛社会导航赛道的技术方案，在Falcon模型基础上加入主动风险感知模块，通过预测碰撞风险分数来提升社交导航性能，在Social-HM3D基准测试中取得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主智能体在动态人流量大的室内环境中安全、高效且符合社会规范的导航问题，特别是在仅使用机载RGB-D传感器和里程计，无法获取全局地图或特权信息的情况下。

Method: 在Falcon模型基础上引入主动风险感知模块，学习预测周围人群基于距离的碰撞风险分数，从而增强空间感知能力和主动避碰行为。

Result: 在Social-HM3D基准测试中，该方法提高了智能体在拥挤室内场景中保持个人空间合规性的能力，同时在16个参赛团队中获得了第二名。

Conclusion: 主动风险感知模块有效提升了社交导航性能，使智能体能够在动态人流量大的环境中更好地遵守社会规范并安全导航。

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

TL;DR: 提出了DualTHOR双臂人形机器人仿真器和Proprio-MLLM模型，通过结合本体感觉信息提升多模态大语言模型在长时程双臂任务中的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在双臂人形机器人的长时程任务中效果有限，主要由于缺乏系统性的仿真平台和模型缺乏本体感知能力，无法推理双臂选择逻辑和身体位置。

Method: 开发了DualTHOR双臂人形仿真器，并提出Proprio-MLLM模型，通过运动位置嵌入和跨空间编码器整合本体感觉信息。

Result: 在现有MLLMs表现不佳的环境中，Proprio-MLLM实现了平均19.75%的规划性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为推进人形机器人的具身智能提供了必要的仿真平台和有效模型。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness
by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position
embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing
MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average
improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an
essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied
intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at

TL;DR: GRACE框架通过可执行分析概念(EAC)弥合视觉语言模型语义推理与机器人物理执行之间的差距，实现精确和通用的机器人操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在高级语义理解与机器人精确物理执行之间的"语义到物理"鸿沟，使机器人能在非结构化环境中进行精确通用操作。

Method: 提出GRACE框架，通过可执行分析概念(EAC)将自然语言指令和视觉信息转化为数学定义的蓝图，编码物体功能、几何约束和操作语义，并据此推导抓取姿态、力方向和物理可行运动轨迹。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中对各种铰接物体实现了强大的零样本泛化能力，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: GRACE通过语义-物理接地提供了高级指令理解与低级机器人控制之间的统一可解释接口，有效实现了精确和可泛化的操作。

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

TL;DR: 提出基于角度-轴空间的方向表示方法，通过加权平均机制在SO(3)流形上融合多条轨迹，同时处理多个局部约束，解决非欧几何带来的失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转群SO(3)是黎曼流形，其非欧几何性质导致局部约束难以整合，特别是同时处理多个局部约束时存在困难。

Method: 使用角度-轴表示法，在不同基点考虑不同局部约束生成多条轨迹，然后通过提出的加权平均机制融合这些轨迹，生成平滑轨迹。

Result: 仿真和实验验证表明，该方法能够适应任意期望路径点的方向、处理角加速度约束，同时整合多个局部约束实现额外收益，如降低加速度成本。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了SO(3)流形上的失真问题，使现成的欧几里得学习算法在非欧空间中重新适用，能够同时处理多个局部约束。

Abstract: Orientation learning plays a pivotal role in many tasks. However, the
rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion
caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the
incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous
incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose
the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several
orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and
minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted
average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our
main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local
constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused
to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,
achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.
Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make
the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean
space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can
not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with
angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local
constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller
acceleration costs.

Abstract: Data-driven robotic manipulation learning depends on large-scale,
high-quality expert demonstration datasets. However, existing datasets, which
primarily rely on human teleoperated robot collection, are limited in terms of
scalability, trajectory smoothness, and applicability across different robotic
embodiments in real-world environments. In this paper, we present FastUMI-100K,
a large-scale UMI-style multimodal demonstration dataset, designed to overcome
these limitations and meet the growing complexity of real-world manipulation
tasks. Collected by FastUMI, a novel robotic system featuring a modular,
hardware-decoupled mechanical design and an integrated lightweight tracking
system, FastUMI-100K offers a more scalable, flexible, and adaptable solution
to fulfill the diverse requirements of real-world robot demonstration data.
Specifically, FastUMI-100K contains over 100K+ demonstration trajectories
collected across representative household environments, covering 54 tasks and
hundreds of object types. Our dataset integrates multimodal streams, including
end-effector states, multi-view wrist-mounted fisheye images and textual
annotations. Each trajectory has a length ranging from 120 to 500 frames.
Experimental results demonstrate that FastUMI-100K enables high policy success
rates across various baseline algorithms, confirming its robustness,
adaptability, and real-world applicability for solving complex, dynamic
manipulation challenges. The source code and dataset will be released in this

TL;DR: 本文提出了CURE方法，将LLM规划中的不确定性分解为认知不确定性和内在不确定性，并通过随机网络蒸馏和MLP回归头进行估计，在机器人任务中取得了更准确的不确定性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在机器人规划中存在幻觉问题，导致过度自信但可能不准确或不安全的计划。现有研究未能充分区分认知不确定性和内在不确定性，限制了不确定性估计的有效性。

Method: 提出CURE方法，将不确定性分解为认知不确定性和内在不确定性，其中认知不确定性进一步细分为任务清晰度和任务熟悉度。使用随机网络蒸馏和基于LLM特征的多层感知机回归头进行不确定性评估。

Result: 在厨房操作和桌面重排两个实验场景中验证，相比现有方法，CURE方法的不确定性估计与实际执行结果更加一致。

Conclusion: CURE方法通过分解和单独估计不同类型的不确定性，显著提高了LLM规划中不确定性估计的准确性，有助于提升机器人任务执行的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

Conclusion: 这是首个在多个挑战性场景中实现自主超声检查的演示，有望改变欠发达地区获得专家级诊断的机会。

Abstract: Liver disease is a major global health burden. While ultrasound is the
first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple
non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not
visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant
expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited
regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising
an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for
localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom
cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness
against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver
ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining,
a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs
effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This
work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across
multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level
diagnostics in underserved regions.

Conclusion: 该聚类技术能够有效处理噪声，提取高质量的常规日志，为机器人流程自动化提供更好的支持。

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of classical and modern control methods
for real-world Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), focusing on
underconstrained systems with limited time discretization. A comparative
analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern

Optimization (TRPO). The results demonstrate that TRPO outperforms other
methods, achieving the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors across various
trajectories and exhibiting robustness to larger time intervals between control
updates. TRPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation enables stable
control in noisy, real-world environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency

Motivation: 随着工业机器人进入共享人类空间，其不透明的决策过程威胁安全、信任和公共监督。该作品旨在探索复杂多智能体AI是否能变得直观可理解。

Method: 采用三个设计原则：竞赛作为清晰指标（谁掀得更高）、身体熟悉性（观众熟悉掀床单动作）、传感器到感官映射（通过森林和天气投影显示机器人合作或竞争关系）。

Result: 在五个国际展览中的观察表明，观众能够实时解读机器人的策略、冲突和合作，情感反应与系统内部状态一致。

Conclusion: 该项目展示了感官隐喻如何将黑盒系统转变为公共界面，使复杂AI决策变得直观可理解。

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision
making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks
whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging
a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet
skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric
(who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping),
and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest
and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read
machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that
audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation
in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.
The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public
interface.

Conclusion: 单级重构方法在保持结果等效性的同时，显著提高了逆最优控制的计算效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function
weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC
uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but
noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming
equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article
presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level
reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through
numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the
proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a
human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The
approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the
computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a
classical bilevel implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest
collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM)
for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application
Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is
updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell
enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair
of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or
validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision
between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a
precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel
manipulator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在资源受限硬件上部署困难，剪枝虽然能压缩大语言模型，但在机器人领域研究不足，且会导致性能急剧下降和安全违规增加。

Method: 在权重空间对密集模型和剪枝模型进行一次性插值计算校正项，推理时每个剪枝层使用该校正来恢复丢失的能力，仅引入一个控制效率与精度权衡的超参数。

Result: 在多种VLA架构和操作导航任务中，GLUESTICK实现了竞争性的内存效率，同时显著恢复成功率并减少安全违规。

Conclusion: GLUESTICK提供了一种无需训练、与剪枝算法无关的高效方法，在保持稀疏性优势的同时恢复VLA模型剪枝后的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both
real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and
costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse
datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的框架来解决机器人手内物体旋转的模拟到现实转换问题，通过联合动态模型和数据高效的自主动态收集策略，实现了对复杂形状、高宽比和小尺寸物体的通用旋转控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂的接触动态导致的"现实差距"，使得从模拟训练的策略难以迁移到真实世界，限制了现有方法在简单几何、有限物体尺寸和约束手腕姿势等场景的应用。

Method: 核心是基于联合的动态模型，通过分解关节动态、压缩系统影响为低维变量，并从每个关节自身的动态特征学习演化，有效拟合有限的真实世界数据并调整模拟策略的动作。配合完全自主动态收集策略获取多样化的真实交互数据。

Result: 单一策略能够成功旋转具有复杂形状（如动物形状）、高宽比（高达5.33）和小尺寸的挑战性物体，同时处理多样的手腕方向和旋转轴，验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界评估和复杂任务的遥操作应用中展示了前所未有的通用性，为解决机器人手内物体旋转的模拟到现实转换挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

Motivation: 使机器人能够零样本执行新颖操作任务是机器人学的核心目标。现有方法通常假设任务分布内或依赖特定平台数据的微调，限制了跨平台迁移能力。

Method: 通过视频生成模型将任务描述合成为视频，使用现成感知模块将其提炼为3D可操作对象流。对于刚性物体计算相对位姿，通过抓取提议和轨迹优化实现机器人动作；对于可变形物体，将对象流作为基于粒子动力学模型的跟踪目标。

Conclusion: 通过将任务理解与低级控制解耦，NovaFlow自然实现了跨平台的迁移能力，为机器人零样本操作提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

Conclusion: 当前自动驾驶策略的评估实践和指标存在有效性疑问，基于认知不确定性的离线指标能更好地桥接离线与在线评估之间的差距。

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

Motivation: 机器人领域缺乏互联网规模的多样化任务演示数据，现有数据集受限于人工收集和整理，限制了模型规模和泛化能力的发展。

Method: 基于LLM规划器的零样本能力，在模拟环境中自动生成多样化操作任务的演示，使用成功示例微调LLM以改进其规划能力，无需人工监督。

Conclusion: BLAZER框架通过自动生成训练数据有效解决了机器人领域数据稀缺问题，显著提升了操作策略的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.

Motivation: 机器人需要全面理解3D场景并评估感知信息的可靠性，但现有方法存在场景特定性和缺乏不确定性建模的问题。

Method: 使用基于体素的通用化特征表示，增量整合RGB-D图像，同时更新不确定性估计。

Result: 不确定性估计能准确描述场景重建和语义特征预测的模型误差，成功应用于移动机械臂的主动物体搜索任务。

Conclusion: UniFField实现了鲁棒决策能力，为复杂环境中的机器人任务提供了可靠的不确定性感知特征表示。

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

Motivation: 目前对自闭症儿童在技能发展前的细微行为模式和情绪识别理解不足，特别是在信息技术领域，机会明显受限，需要建立基础理解来改善干预效果。

Method: 采用纵向方法监测情绪和行为，分析随时间变化的行为趋势，建立针对性的应用和技术辅助框架。

Result: 研究建立了自闭症学生独特需求和挑战的基线理解，提出了基于证据的序列干预方法。

Conclusion: 通过早期识别行为模式，可以创建更具包容性的学习环境，显著改善自闭症儿童的教育和发展轨迹。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态漏洞数据可以缓解软件漏洞共利用攻击带来的风险，但设计有效的多模态图神经网络架构具有挑战性，传统方法无法处理模态异质性。

Method: 采用模态感知协同进化框架，将全局染色体划分为模态特定基因组分别进化，结合双轨代理方法和基于相似性的种群多样性指标策略。

Result: 在标准VulCE数据集上达到81.67%的F1分数，仅需3GPU小时，比现有最佳方法提升8.7%F1分数并减少27%计算成本。

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS方法能有效处理模态异质性，显著提高漏洞共利用攻击预测性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Motivation: 现有多模态学习模型存在两个关键挑战：不同数据模态学习不均衡导致模型偏向某些模态，以及模型可能偏向特定人口群体导致不公平性能

Method: MultiFair方法采用双重梯度调制过程，在数据模态和群体两个层面上动态调节训练梯度的优化方向和幅度

Result: 在两个多模态医学数据集上的实验表明，MultiFair优于最先进的多模态学习和公平性学习方法

Conclusion: MultiFair能有效解决多模态医学分类中的模态偏差和群体不公平问题

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

TL;DR: 本文评估了两种深度学习模型(GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT)在作物产量预测中的跨区域泛化能力，发现GNN-RNN在地理转移下表现更优，而MMST-ViT在域外条件下性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化日益扰乱农业系统，准确的作物产量预测对粮食安全至关重要。虽然深度学习模型在使用卫星和天气数据进行产量预测方面显示出潜力，但其跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力（对实际部署至关重要）尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 使用覆盖2017-2022年1200多个美国县的大规模CropNet数据集，在现实的域外条件下对GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT两种最先进模型进行基准测试，采用跨七个USDA农场资源区域的留一集群交叉验证和年度预测场景。

Result: GNN-RNN表现出优越的泛化能力，在地理转移下保持正相关，而MMST-ViT在域内表现良好但在域外条件下性能急剧下降。Heartland和Northern Great Plains等区域显示稳定的转移动态（大豆RMSE小于10 bu/acre），而Prairie Gateway区域在两个模型和作物上都表现不佳（RMSE大于20 bu/acre）。GNN-RNN训练速度比MMST-ViT快135倍。

Conclusion: 研究发现时空对齐（而不仅仅是模型复杂性或数据规模）是稳健泛化的关键，强调需要透明的域外评估协议来确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

Motivation: 解决GPU内核生成任务中高质量数据稀缺的问题，因为大多数高质量内核是专有的且不开源，这阻碍了使用监督微调来对齐LLMs到内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选带有推理轨迹的高质量CUDA内核的管道，构建ConCuR数据集，并训练KernelCoder模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，该模型显著优于现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，超越了所有为内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，该研究的方法、指标和数据收集管道有助于未来在内核生成任务中获得更好的数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Motivation: 现有提升LLM推理能力的方法要么依赖模型规模扩展，要么依赖复杂的思维链生成。研究发现推理所需的关键计算集中在有限层中，因此提出更高效的方法。

Method: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD)方法：在中期训练阶段训练模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，推理时在这些选定层上迭代计算。

Result: 在17个推理基准上取得显著提升，特别是GSM8K相对准确率提升28.4%，MATH提升36%（使用OLMo-2 1B Base模型）。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

Result: 算法在对抗性设置中实现了Θ(T^{2/3})的最小最大最优遗憾，在（被破坏的）随机机制中保证了多对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的BOBW算法成功解决了线性上下文老虎机中的付费观察问题，在对抗性和随机环境中都表现出色，为"困难问题"提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP是一种基于偏好调优的上下文多臂老虎机路由方法，在训练时模拟在线反馈设置，支持在测试时无需重新训练即可调整性能/成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模部署LLM需要高效的路由机制，传统离线训练方法在部署时失效，因为只能观察到所选模型的结果，存在部分反馈限制。

Method: 将LLM路由建模为基于提示特征和用户偏好向量的上下文多臂老虎机问题，在训练时模拟在线反馈环境，适应每个新提示的路由决策。

Result: 实验表明该方法比强离线路由器至少提升12.46%，比最大LLM至少提升2.45%，并且在未见任务上具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BaRP方法成功解决了LLM路由中的在线决策问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低成本，支持灵活的偏好调优。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个两时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习算法，通过Polyak-Ruppert平均实现了在马尔可夫数据下的最优收敛速率，解决了现有方法依赖未知参数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习可以显著加速强化学习，但现有基于马尔可夫链训练样本的时序差分学习方法需要依赖未知问题参数才能达到最优收敛速率，这在实际应用中存在限制。

Method: 设计了两时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习算法，结合Polyak-Ruppert平均技术，构建了一个参数无关的联邦时序差分学习方法。

Result: 该方法在平均奖励和折扣设置下都实现了最优的收敛速率O~(1/NT)，其中N是智能体数量，T是迭代次数。

Conclusion: 提出的参数无关联邦时序差分学习方法在马尔可夫数据下实现了最优收敛性能，适用于异构环境的联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: MoGU是一种用于回归任务和时间序列预测的混合专家框架，通过高斯分布建模专家输出，并使用基于不确定性的门控机制来量化预测和不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合专家方法只提供点估计，无法量化预测的不确定性。MoGU旨在解决这个问题，为时间序列预测提供可靠的预测和不确定性估计。

Method: MoGU将每个专家的输出建模为高斯分布，使用基于不确定性的门控机制（而非传统的基于输入的门控网络），根据专家估计的方差来确定其对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，MoGU持续优于单专家模型和传统混合专家设置，并提供与预测误差直接相关的良好量化的信息性不确定性。

Conclusion: MoGU通过引入基于不确定性的门控机制和高斯分布建模，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和可靠性，为预测不确定性提供了有效的量化方法。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

TL;DR: 提出metabeta模型，使用基于transformer的神经网络进行贝叶斯混合效应回归，相比传统MCMC方法显著减少推理时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合效应回归在实证科学中广泛应用，但贝叶斯推断需要昂贵的MCMC近似方法，计算成本高

Method: 使用基于transformer的神经网络模型metabeta，通过模拟数据集进行预训练，将计算负担从推理时转移到训练时

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，metabeta达到与MCMC相当的稳定性能，但所需时间大幅减少

Conclusion: metabeta为贝叶斯混合效应回归提供了一种高效替代方案，显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用张量补全作为替代模型，在材料设计空间非均匀采样的情况下加速晶格结构优化设计，相比传统机器学习方法在偏置采样场景下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料设计方法在搜索空间随设计变量增加呈指数增长时变得不切实际且耗时。机器学习方法在训练数据来自非均匀随机采样的场景下表现不佳，因为实验人员可能因便利性而更频繁地合成和验证某些材料。

Method: 使用张量补全作为替代模型来加速材料设计，特别是在非均匀监督学习场景下。与高斯过程和XGBoost等经典机器学习方法进行比较。

Result: 在偏置采样的搜索空间中，张量补全优于经典机器学习方法，R²提高了约5%。在均匀随机采样的整个搜索空间中，张量补全仍能提供相当的性能。

Conclusion: 张量补全是一种有效的替代模型，特别适用于材料设计中的非均匀采样场景，能够显著加速具有特定机械性能的晶格结构优化设计过程。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是美国第三大常见癌症和主要死亡原因，虽然吸烟是主要风险因素，但不吸烟者和家族聚集性研究显示存在遗传因素，GWAS识别的遗传生物标志物有望用于评估肺癌风险。

Method: HEMERA框架直接处理原始基因型数据，引入加性位置编码、神经基因型嵌入和改进的变异过滤，使用基于分层集成梯度的后验可解释性模块将模型预测归因于特定SNP。

Result: 在27,254名百万退伍军人计划参与者数据上训练，HEMERA实现了>99%的AUC得分，模型预测与已知肺癌风险位点高度一致。

Conclusion: 研究支持使用透明、可生成假设的模型进行个性化肺癌风险评估和早期干预。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

Motivation: 解决机器生成文本检测中的实际问题：评分模型可能与未知源模型不匹配，且对比生成成本高昂。

Method: 将surprisal量化为可解释状态，估计测试文本的状态转移矩阵，通过广义Jensen-Shannon差距与固定参考（人类vs机器）进行比较。

Result: 在多个数据集、源模型和场景下，SurpMark始终匹配或超越基线方法，实验证实了统计量的渐近正态性。

Conclusion: SurpMark是一种有效的黑盒检测方法，提出的离散化标准具有理论依据和实践有效性。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Motivation: 现有研究通常只关注孤立的攻击面或特定场景，缺乏对多智能体系统漏洞的整体理解，需要系统性的评估基准。

Method: 引入PEAR基准测试，专注于广泛采用的规划器-执行器结构，通过大量实验评估不同配置下的系统表现。

Result: 发现弱规划器比弱执行器更严重影响任务性能；规划器需要记忆模块而执行器不需要；存在性能与鲁棒性权衡；针对规划器的攻击特别有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现为增强多智能体系统鲁棒性提供了可行见解，并为多智能体环境中的原则性防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有复杂的时序依赖和跨通道交互，传统方法难以有效分析。受人类视觉检查模式的启发，探索视觉表示是否能增强自动化时间序列分析。

Method: 提出MLLM4TS框架，将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图，采用时序感知视觉块对齐策略，融合数值数据的细粒度时序细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）上都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 将视觉模态与预训练语言模型相结合，有望实现鲁棒且可泛化的时间序列分析，展示了多模态方法在时间序列分析领域的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

Conclusion: 小波分析具有构建鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的睡眠阶段分类系统的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

Motivation: 现实世界图中的边往往表现出对某些群体对的连接偏好，这种有偏连接不仅会加剧甚至会在下游基于图的任务中引发不公平处理。

Method: 提出了Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp)方法，这是一种基于优化的方法，有两种变体：一种利用图平稳性的交换性质直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图谱中的偏差来隐式鼓励公平估计。

Result: 该方法具有高概率性能界限，在公平性和准确性之间产生条件权衡。分析表明，恢复公平图不一定需要牺牲准确性。在合成和真实数据集上的评估证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp方法能够有效估计公平图，两种变体各有优势，在保持准确性的同时确保图的公平性。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Conclusion: FML-based tDT方法能够有效构建紧凑的动态系统，显著节省计算成本，同时保持对感兴趣量长期动态的准确预测能力。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了两层神经网络中dropout在大宽度极限下的渐近行为，揭示了五种不同的非退化相，发现dropout的惩罚效应仅在极小学习率下存在，而在较大学习率下等效于随机几何技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为理解dropout在大型神经网络中作用的第一步，研究其在两层神经网络大宽度极限下的梯度下降行为，揭示dropout在不同参数设置下的本质机制。

Method: 使用均值场初始化尺度，分析梯度下降与dropout在两层神经网络中的大宽度渐近行为，结合均值场粒子系统和随机过程工具进行收敛证明。

Result: 获得了丰富的渐近相图，包含五个不同的非退化相，发现dropout的惩罚效应仅在学习率为O(1/宽度)量级时存在，较大学习率下消失，此时dropout等效于随机几何技术。极限由均值场跳跃过程描述，神经元更新时间遵循独立泊松或伯努利时钟。

Conclusion: 研究结果为重新理解大规模神经网络中dropout的理论基础奠定了基础，揭示了dropout在不同学习率下的本质差异，为后续研究提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散生成方法为基于神经网络的符号回归开辟了新的研究机会，在某些方面优于自回归生成。

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures

emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出ExpA（扩展动作空间）方法，将环境交互从语言中解耦，让LLM能够在语言环境和外部环境之间切换，并通过EARL强化学习算法优化策略，在需要多轮交互和条件规划的任务中表现优于传统词汇约束方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的环境交互必须通过预定义格式的文本表达，这既增加了语言模型的负担，又需要外部解析器。论文旨在将环境交互从语言中分离出来，让模型能够直接与环境互动。

Method: 提出ExpA框架，允许模型在语言环境和外部环境之间切换；引入EARL强化学习算法，使用反事实策略优化来促进对新环境和扩展动作空间的探索。

Result: 在需要多轮交互和条件规划的任务中，EARL优于强基线方法；在基于计算器的多任务学习中表现稳健；在部分可观测排序问题中，实现了完美的Sort-4准确率，并自发现了与经典设计相竞争的高效算法。

Conclusion: 通过将环境交互内部化到扩展动作空间中，可以显著提升LLM与环境交互的能力，使其在复杂任务中表现更优，同时减轻语言模型的负担。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图机器学习已有成熟框架，但时序图ML缺乏可比的基础设施。现有时序图库通常针对特定架构设计，阻碍了对多样化模型的支持，且连续时间和离散时间方法之间的分离限制了直接比较和思想交流。

Method: 开发Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM)库，统一连续时间和离散时间动态图方法，提供动态节点特征的一流支持、时间粒度转换，以及链接、节点和图级任务的原生处理。

Result: TGM在多个模型、数据集和任务上相比广泛使用的DyGLib实现了平均7.8倍加速，在图离散化方面相比现有实现实现了平均175倍加速。此外，TGM能够实现动态图属性预测和时间驱动训练范式等新的研究可能性。

Conclusion: TGM填补了时序图机器学习基础设施的空白，不仅显著提升了效率，还开启了以前难以研究的新研究方向，为时序图ML研究提供了统一且高效的平台。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力机制的Transformer模型，用于铁路轨道间接结构健康监测中的断轨检测，通过无监督学习方法解决小尺寸瞬态异常检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接结构健康监测(iSHM)使用车载传感器进行铁路轨道评估成本效益高，但可靠检测小尺寸(2-10厘米)瞬态异常面临复杂车辆动力学、信号噪声和标记数据稀缺等挑战。

Method: 引入增量合成数据基准测试，评估模型对速度变化、多通道输入和真实噪声模式的鲁棒性。提出注意力聚焦Transformer模型，通过自注意力机制，在重建训练中主要从学习到的注意力权重偏差推导异常分数。

Result: 基准测试显示Transformer模型普遍优于其他模型，但所有测试模型对高频局部噪声都表现出显著脆弱性。提出的模型在保持与最先进解决方案相当准确度的同时，展示了更好的推理速度。

Conclusion: 未来iSHM模型需要增强噪声鲁棒性，基于注意力的高效方法为开发实用的车载异常检测系统提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

Motivation: 大型快速演化的图需要能够捕捉变化关系、表达校准置信度并抵抗对抗性操纵的信任评估模型。

Method: 使用高斯分布表示节点和边，结合不确定性感知的消息传递、混合绝对-高斯-沙漏位置编码、Kolmogorov-Arnold网络注意力机制、ODE残差学习模块，以及基于余弦和Jaccard相似度的鲁棒自适应集成系数分析。

Conclusion: DGTEN统一框架在动态信任评估中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

Conclusion: 为LLM遗忘研究提供了全面的重新审视和可操作的指导，强调了需要更细粒度的评估方法来准确衡量遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

Conclusion: ICS方法在缓解灾难性遗忘方面有效，但随着任务数量增加，长期知识保留仍面临挑战，这凸显了持续学习中的复杂性和权衡，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18

*Perry Dong,Chongyi Zheng,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流模型的价值流方法，用于估计完整的未来回报分布，并通过流导数ODE识别高回报方差状态，在37个状态基准任务和25个图像基准任务上平均成功率提升1.3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法将未来回报分布扁平化为单一标量值，而分布RL方法利用回报分布提供更强的学习信号。现有方法主要使用离散分箱或有限分位数估计，无法揭示回报分布的细粒度结构，也难以区分具有高回报不确定性的状态用于决策。

Method: 使用现代灵活的基于流模型来估计完整的未来回报分布，提出新的流匹配目标生成满足分布贝尔曼方程的概率密度路径，基于学习到的流模型通过新的流导数ODE估计不同状态的回报不确定性，并利用不确定性信息优先学习某些转换的更准确回报估计。

Result: 在37个状态基准任务和25个图像基准任务上的实验表明，价值流方法平均成功率提升1.3倍。

Conclusion: 基于流模型的价值流方法能够有效估计完整的回报分布并识别高不确定性状态，在离线学习和在线到在线设置中优于先前方法。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQS是首个在SAFL中理论分析并解决梯度聚合和模型聚合差异的框架，通过客户分类和自适应优化，在准确率、收敛速度和稳定性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半异步联邦学习(SAFL)在梯度聚合和模型聚合策略之间存在权衡：梯度聚合收敛快但波动大，模型聚合稳定但收敛慢且精度低。需要统一解决方案来弥合这一差距。

Method: FedQS采用分治策略，根据数据分布特征和计算资源将客户端分为四种类型，并自适应优化其本地训练过程。

Result: 在计算机视觉、自然语言处理和真实任务上的广泛实验表明，FedQS实现了最高准确率、最低损失，并且收敛速度排名前列，优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FedQS弥合了SAFL中聚合策略之间的差距，为稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Motivation: 离线强化学习无需昂贵在线交互，但现有方法在处理复杂长时程顺序决策时仍存在困难。

Method: 提出DEAS框架，利用动作序列进行价值学习，通过半马尔可夫决策过程Q学习解释，采用分离价值学习减少价值高估。

Result: DEAS在OGBench的复杂长时程任务中持续优于基线方法，并能提升大规模视觉-语言-动作模型的性能，在RoboCasa Kitchen仿真和真实世界操作任务中显著提升表现。

Conclusion: DEAS是一种简单有效的离线RL框架，通过动作序列和分离价值学习成功解决了复杂长时程任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI电商直播中的数字分身需要实时响应，但大型推理模型延迟过高，无法满足实时交互需求。

Method: 第一阶段：使用拒绝采样微调将670B教师模型蒸馏为30B MoE模型（3B激活）；第二阶段：使用组相对策略优化的强化学习压缩推理路径，平衡正确性、帮助性和简洁性。

Result: 计算成本降低30倍，实现亚秒级延迟；在淘宝直播中响应正确性提升3.3%，帮助性提升21.8%；测试显示GMV显著增长。

Conclusion: LiveThinking框架有效解决了AI电商直播中的实时响应问题，显著提升了用户体验和商业表现。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

TL;DR: 提出了GRFs++，一种改进的图随机特征方法，通过walk-stitching技术和更灵活的游走长度分布策略，解决了传统GRFs在建模远距离节点关系和采样效率方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图随机特征(GRFs)存在难以建模远距离节点关系、依赖长随机游走采样效率低、终止机制过于简单等问题，需要改进以提高图核计算的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用walk-stitching技术将多个短游走拼接而不破坏无偏性，用并行计算短游走和矩阵乘法替代顺序采样长游走；扩展终止机制到更一般的游走长度分布策略。

Result: GRFs++继承了长游走的近似质量但效率更高，提高了图核的近似精度而不增加计算成本，理论和实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRFs++成功解决了传统GRFs的多个长期限制，在保持无偏性的同时显著提升了图核计算的效率和准确性。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高收集成本和日益增长的隐私问题，获取大规模LBSN轨迹数据困难。生成式AI提供了通过合成数据保护隐私同时保留数据特征的新机会。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用稀疏感知时空扩散模型(S²TDiff)从原始轨迹重建连续规则的运动序列；第二阶段使用Transformer-based Seq2Seq架构Coarse2FineNet，通过动态上下文融合和多任务混合头解码器生成细粒度轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和实用性评估上优于最先进模型，在FS-TKY数据集上距离和半径指标分别提高了69%和55%。

Conclusion: GeoGen成功解决了LBSN签到轨迹生成的挑战，为POI推荐、广告和疫情干预等应用提供了高质量的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了MeSH方案解决递归transformer的性能瓶颈，通过外部内存和轻量级路由器实现迭代间的功能专业化，在1.4B规模上超越非递归模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归transformer在参数复用和计算深度解耦方面有优势，但在相同计算量下性能落后于非递归模型，主要存在计算模式单一和信息过载两个瓶颈

Method: 引入Memory-as-State-Highways方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，使用轻量级路由器动态多样化各迭代的计算

Result: 在Pythia套件上，MeSH增强的递归transformer持续优于递归基线，在1.4B规模上超越更大的非递归模型，下游准确率平均提升1.06%，非嵌入参数减少33%

Conclusion: MeSH是构建更强递归模型的可扩展且原则性的架构

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Method: 通过理论证明和实际案例展示t-SNE的两个主要失效模式

Conclusion: t-SNE可视化结果不能准确反映原始数据的聚类特征和异常点信息

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

Motivation: 现有图基础模型需要集中访问多领域图数据，这在隐私和制度约束下往往不可行。联邦图基础模型解决了这一限制，但其有效性依赖于构建一个既能在领域内保持语义一致性，又能在领域间保持多样性的全局代码本。

Method: FedBook采用两阶段过程：1) 领域内协作：通过参考语义更可靠的高频token来精炼低频token，增强领域特定一致性；2) 领域间集成：根据客户端代码本的语义独特性加权聚合，保持跨领域多样性。

Result: 在多个领域和任务的8个基准测试中，FedBook始终优于21个基线方法，包括孤立监督学习、FL/FGL、集中式GFM的联邦适应以及FedGFM技术。

Conclusion: FedBook通过系统化的联邦代码本聚合策略，有效解决了图基础模型在联邦学习环境中的挑战，在保持领域内一致性和领域间多样性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Conclusion: 弱形式方程学习技术能够从高度稀疏的实验数据中学习有效的昆虫种群运动模型，为害虫管理提供预测工具。

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了HySim-LLM框架，通过嵌入加权微调和流形感知去噪来增强LLM在生物医学结构化数据中的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从科学文献中提取和标准化药代动力学信息存在挑战，限制了药物开发中数据驱动模型的可靠性。LLM在生物医学结构化数据（如PK表格）的适应受到异质性、噪声和领域偏移的限制。

Method: 提出HySim-LLM统一数学和计算框架，整合嵌入加权微调和流形感知去噪。建立了两个理论结果：相似性加权泛化边界和流形去噪保证。

Result: 为在结构化生物医学环境中微调LLM提供了理论基础，量化了嵌入差异下的适应性能，并限制了噪声或离流样本的损失贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域提供了可靠且可解释的LLM适应的数学基础路径。

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

*Anu Agarwal,Mihir Pamnani,Dilek Hakkani-Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SIMU框架，通过选择性更新关键神经元来增强二阶优化器遗忘方法，在保持遗忘效果的同时显著减少对模型原有知识的损害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一阶和二阶优化器遗忘方法虽然能有效让大语言模型遗忘敏感信息，但往往严重损害模型的原有能力和知识保留。

Method: 采用两步框架，首先识别编码遗忘集的关键神经元，然后仅对这些目标神经元进行选择性更新。

Result: SIMU在实现可比较的遗忘效果的同时，在保留模型原有知识方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 选择性影响机制是解决机器遗忘中知识保留问题的有效方法，SIMU框架在遗忘效果和知识保留之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

*Weisen Jiang,Sinno Jialin Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaDefense是一个针对大型语言模型微调越狱攻击的新型防御框架，采用两阶段防御方法，在生成前和生成中检测有害内容，显著优于现有防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到未见攻击模板伪装的有害查询，尽管LLMs在嵌入空间能够区分这些查询。

Method: 提出两阶段防御：预生成防御在响应生成前检测有害查询，中生成防御在生成过程中监控部分响应以防止输出更多有害内容。通过专门提示训练LLM预测查询和部分响应的危害性。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的广泛实验表明，MetaDefense显著优于现有防御机制，对可见和未见攻击模板的有害查询都能实现稳健防御，同时在良性任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MetaDefense框架通过两阶段防御方法有效抵御微调越狱攻击，为LLMs安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种测试时自改进方法TT-SI，通过识别模型不确定样本、生成相似示例并进行测试时微调，显著提升模型性能，同时大幅减少训练样本需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型微调依赖大量训练数据，效率低且成本高，无法保证模型对复杂场景的泛化能力。现有技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新信息，导致不必要的成本。

Method: 三步骤算法：1) 识别模型难以处理的样本（自感知）；2) 从不确定样本生成相似示例（自数据增强）；3) 在测试时使用新生成样本进行微调（自改进）。比较了TT-SI（同模型生成）和TT-D（强模型生成）两种变体。

Result: TT-SI在所有基准测试中平均绝对准确率提升5.48%，超越其他标准学习方法，同时使用的训练样本减少68倍。

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我进化的新范式潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于元学习的图级异常检测框架MA-GAD，通过图压缩模块减少噪声干扰，利用元学习从相似网络中提取元异常信息，在少样本条件下显著提升图级异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法严重依赖大量标注数据，而现实场景中标注数据往往不足；少样本异常检测方法易受噪声干扰，导致嵌入质量差和模型鲁棒性降低。

Conclusion: MA-GAD通过结合图压缩和元学习，有效解决了少样本图级异常检测中的噪声干扰和标注数据不足问题，在真实数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信号噪声比估计和机器学习噪声方差估计的SEM图像去噪方法，结合线性最小二乘回归和优化高斯过程回归来指导Wiener滤波器，实现有效的图像质量增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEM图像常受噪声污染影响图像质量和后续分析，需要开发更准确的SNR和噪声方差估计方法来指导去噪过程。

Method: 比较了五种SNR估计方法，发现LSR方法最优；然后测试SVM和GPR模型进行噪声方差估计，最终选择优化GPR模型；结合这些结果提出了AO-GPRLLSR滤波管道，使用估计的噪声方差指导Wiener滤波器。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了SEM图像的准确SNR和噪声方差估计，并通过NV指导的Wiener滤波器有效提升了图像质量，为SEM图像处理提供了更稳健和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法使用简化的离散形式无法充分捕捉分子结合亲和力和反应性，药物相互作用风险仍是临床决策支持系统的重要挑战

Method: 使用ELF生成3D电子密度图，结合ELF衍生的全局电子特性特征和二分图编码器建模局部子结构相互作用，学习药物分子的互补特征

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上与SafeDrug等基线模型比较，F1分数、Jaccard系数和DDI率均有统计学显著改善

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard是一个通过草图压缩技术降低去中心化联邦学习通信和计算成本的拜占庭鲁棒防御框架，使用Count Sketch将高维模型压缩为低维草图进行相似性比较，仅在通过筛选的邻居间交换完整模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒DFL防御方法需要每个客户端在每轮训练中与所有邻居交换和比较完整的高维模型向量，产生了难以承受的通信和计算成本，阻碍了在web规模上的部署。

Method: 使用Count Sketch将d维模型压缩为k维草图（k << d）进行相似性比较，然后仅从接受的邻居处选择性获取完整模型，将每轮通信复杂度从O(d|N_i|)降低到O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)。

Result: SketchGuard在保持与最先进方法相同鲁棒性的同时，计算时间减少高达82%，通信开销减少50-70%，且收益随模型维度和网络连接性呈乘性增长。

Conclusion: 草图压缩技术是实现在web规模上鲁棒去中心化联邦学习的基本使能器。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于SNN时间特性的自蒸馏方法，将每个时间步视为子模型，通过强-弱子模型间的相互蒸馏提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN与ANN存在性能差距，传统知识蒸馏依赖大型教师模型或引入额外训练开销，需要更高效的SNN训练方法。

Method: 将SNN解构为多个时间步子模型，评估各子模型置信度识别强弱关系，提出Strong2Weak和Weak2Strong两种自蒸馏方案，支持集成、同步和级联蒸馏实现。

Result: 方法有效提升了SNN的判别能力和整体性能，同时增强了对抗鲁棒性，受益于自蒸馏带来的稳定性。

Conclusion: 巧妙利用了SNN的时间特性，为高效训练高性能SNN提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进基于PAC-Bayes边界的神经网络风险证书的可用性，使其在实际应用中更加实用和有效。

Method: 1. 推导伯努利分布KL散度的两个边界；2. 基于隐式微分的方法将PAC-Bayesian风险证书优化引入网络训练目标函数；3. 优化非可微目标（如0-1损失）的边界方法。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上实现了首个非平凡泛化边界，为神经网络提供了实用的风险证书。

Conclusion: 提出的理论贡献显著提升了PAC-Bayes边界在神经网络风险证书中的实用性和有效性，特别是在CIFAR-10上实现了首个非平凡泛化边界。

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

TL;DR: DISCO提出了一种新的模型评估方法，通过选择模型间分歧最大的样本来预测最终性能，避免了传统聚类方法的复杂性，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本过高，传统方法依赖聚类选择锚点子集，过程复杂且对设计选择敏感，限制了创新包容性并增加环境影响。

Method: DISCO方法选择模型间分歧最大的前k个样本，使用贪心的样本级统计而非全局聚类，理论证明模型间分歧为这种选择提供了信息论最优规则。

Result: 在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等基准测试中，DISCO在性能预测方面优于先前方法，达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: 促进样本多样性并非关键，重要的是选择能最大化模型响应多样性的样本，DISCO方法概念更简单且效果更好。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测中，预测未见训练数据的基因扰动效果时，需要考虑模型不确定性和数据不确定性，两者对预测可靠性至关重要。

Method: 开发了PRESCRIBE（PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation），一种多变量深度证据回归框架，能够联合测量两种不确定性来源。

Conclusion: PRESCRIBE通过联合估计不确定性的能力，能够过滤不可靠结果，显著提高单细胞扰动预测的可靠性。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体强化学习框架，集成了高效的气候代理模型来替代计算昂贵的气候模拟器，实现了100倍以上的训练加速，同时保持政策保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候政策研究需要能够捕捉多种温室气体对全球温度综合影响的模型，但这些模型计算成本高昂，难以嵌入强化学习系统。

Method: 开发了基于循环神经网络的代理模型，在20,000条多气体排放路径上预训练，替代CICERO-SCM气候模型，实现1000倍的单步推理加速。

Result: 代理模型达到接近模拟器的精度（全球平均温度RMSE≈0.0004K），在气候政策MARL设置中实现>100倍的端到端训练加速，且与模拟器收敛到相同的最优政策。

Conclusion: 该方法绕过了核心计算瓶颈而不牺牲政策保真度，使得在大规模多智能体实验中研究多气体动态和高保真气候响应的替代气候政策制度成为可能。

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

TL;DR: 多Gossip步骤(MGS)作为去中心化与中心化训练之间的桥梁，通过稳定性分析推导出泛化误差上界，解释了MGS有效性的理论原因并证明其无法完全消除与中心化训练的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化训练虽然通信效率高，但性能通常低于中心化训练。MGS能显著缩小这一差距，但其有效性理论原因以及是否能完全消除差距仍是未解问题。

Method: 使用稳定性分析推导MGS的泛化误差和超额误差上界，分析学习率、数据异质性、节点数量、样本大小和通信拓扑等因素在非凸设置下的影响。

Result: MGS以指数速率减少优化误差，但即使MGS趋于无穷大，与中心化mini-batch SGD相比仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距。在CIFAR数据集上的实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: MGS能有效提升去中心化训练性能，但理论证明无法完全消除与中心化训练的性能差距，为去中心化训练提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

*Kazuki Egashira,Robin Staab,Thibaud Gloaguen,Mark Vero,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次揭示了现代LLM剪枝方法的安全漏洞：攻击者可以构建看似良性的模型，但在剪枝后会表现出恶意行为，通过在不易被剪枝的参数中注入恶意行为，并用易被剪枝的参数修复模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然模型剪枝在减少LLM内存占用方面取得了显著进展，但其安全影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究剪枝方法可能被恶意利用的安全风险。

Method: 攻击者计算每个参数被剪枝可能性的代理指标，在不易被剪枝的参数中注入恶意行为，然后用易被剪枝的参数修复模型，从而在剪枝前隐藏恶意行为。

Result: 在五个模型上的广泛评估显示，经过vLLM中的剪枝方法（Magnitude、Wanda、SparseGPT）处理后，模型在多种攻击场景中表现出强烈的恶意行为（越狱成功率高达95.7%，良性指令拒绝率98.7%，目标内容注入成功率99.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了部署时的关键安全漏洞，强调了在模型压缩中加强安全意识的紧迫性。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Conclusion: 检查点回收方法为经济高效的大语言模型预训练奠定了基础

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需位置校准的无线电地图构建，在复杂室内环境下表现出优越的定位性能。

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将后门攻击视为任务向量的新框架，通过后门向量(BV)来分析攻击相似性和可转移性，并提出了稀疏后门向量(SBV)来增强攻击效果，以及注射BV减法(IBVS)作为无假设的后门防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并(MM)虽然有效但存在严重安全风险，容易受到后门攻击。现有研究显示单个微调模型实例中的隐藏触发器可以让攻击者在推理时控制最终合并模型的输出。

Method: 1. 将后门攻击视为任务向量，计算后门向量(BV)作为后门微调模型与干净微调模型权重之差；2. 提出稀疏后门向量(SBV)将多个攻击合并为单一攻击；3. 提出注射BV减法(IBVS)作为无假设防御方法。

Result: SBV超越了之前的攻击方法，是首个利用合并来提升后门有效性的技术。同时IBVS提供了轻量级通用防御，即使在完全未知后门威胁时仍保持有效。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了模型合并中后门威胁的核心漏洞：利用基础模型对抗弱点的固有触发器，并提出了有效的攻击和防御框架，为理解后门攻击提供了新视角。

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅通过增加模型宽度（无需参数置换）配合合适的softmax温度校准，即可实现线性模式连接（LMC），并提出了层间指数加权连接（LEWC）来解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为实现LMC需要参数置换搜索和足够宽的模型，本研究旨在验证仅通过模型宽度扩展是否足以实现LMC。

Method: 使用softmax温度校准方法，分析中间层输出，引入层间指数加权连接（LEWC）概念来解释模型合并机制。

Result: 实证证明仅通过增加模型宽度配合温度校准即可实现LMC，无需参数置换，且合并模型输出等同于原始模型的集成。

Conclusion: 模型宽度扩展不仅促进非线性模式连接，也显著增加实现线性模式连接的可能性，这是首次证明这一现象的研究。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

Motivation: 现有分块预填充调度方法虽然能稳定时间间隔，但在MoE模型中会导致专家权重重复加载，增加内存流量和能耗。

Method: 将模型垂直分区为连续层组，在层组间交错执行预填充和解码操作，避免分块引起的MoE权重重载。

Result: 减少片外带宽需求，TTFT降低70%，端到端延迟降低41%，每token能耗降低22%，改善TTFT-TBT帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 从token到层的调度轴转换开启了高效、能耗感知的LLM服务新操作模式。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨受试者EEG基础模型提供了一条实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型虽然具有强大的泛化能力，但会保留与下游任务无关的信息，导致计算效率问题和潜在的信息泄露风险。现有方法主要关注类别遗忘，但在实际应用中仅遗忘对象类别往往不够，需要更细粒度的域级别遗忘。

Conclusion: 近似域遗忘(ADU)是一个重要且具有挑战性的新问题，所提出的方法能够有效解决域分布纠缠问题，实现细粒度的知识移除，同时保持模型整体性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

*Chen Wang,Zhaochun Li,Jionghao Bai,Yuzhi Zhang,Shisheng Cui,Zhou Zhao,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了AEPO方法解决强化学习微调中的熵崩溃问题，通过温度调节和REINFORCE策略梯度实现精确的熵控制，揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法存在熵崩溃问题，导致探索消失和策略过早收敛，现有熵正则化方法只能部分缓解问题且引入偏差和不稳定性。

Method: AEPO通过用温度调整分布上的REINFORCE策略梯度替换熵奖励，并通过温度调节稳定熵，包含三个关键设计：策略梯度作为正则化、分布作为正则化、REINFORCE作为正则化。

Result: AEPO能够稳定熵在任意目标水平，有效消除GRPO中的熵崩溃；揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系；提供了更广泛的RFT范式。

Conclusion: AEPO解决了熵控制问题，阐明了熵、探索和推理能力之间的关系，并为强化学习微调提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

*Aman Sharma,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于熵的框架，利用token级logprobs的香农熵作为置信度信号实现早期停止，在保持任务准确性的同时节省25-50%计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用高级后训练优化中出现的基于熵的置信度校准特性，提高大语言模型在推理任务中的token效率。

Method: 使用token级logprobs的香农熵作为置信度信号实现早期停止，只需少量推理数据集样本即可一次性计算模型特定的熵阈值。

Result: 在推理优化模型系列中实现25-50%计算成本降低，同时保持准确性，表明高级推理模型能早期识别正确答案。

Conclusion: 置信度机制是现代后训练推理系统区别于前代模型的关键特征，这种新兴的置信度感知可被利用来节省token和降低延迟。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GALA是一个可扩展的联邦无监督多源域自适应框架，通过组间差异最小化和温度控制的质心加权策略，解决了多源域自适应在大规模异构源域下的计算效率和稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式无监督多源域自适应方法通常假设源域数量较少，无法有效扩展到大量异构源域，导致计算开销高或性能不稳定。

Method: 提出GALA框架，包含两个关键组件：(1) 组间差异最小化目标，无需二次计算即可有效近似全对域对齐；(2) 温度控制的质心加权策略，根据与目标域的对齐程度动态优先处理源域。

Result: 在标准基准测试和新提出的Digit-18基准上，GALA始终达到竞争性或最先进的结果，在多样多源设置中显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: GALA通过创新的组间差异最小化和动态加权策略，实现了在大规模异构源域下的稳定和可并行训练，解决了现有方法在可扩展性和稳定性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架，通过动态整合非自回归机制的丰富上下文信息来增强自回归生成，在九物种肽测序基准测试中显著超越AR和NAR基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在生物序列生成中受限于单向性，无法捕捉关键的全局双向标记依赖关系；非自回归模型虽然提供双向表示，但在生成连贯性和可扩展性方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用共享输入编码器和两个解码器：非自回归解码器学习潜在双向生物特征，自回归解码器利用这些双向特征合成生物序列。通过跨解码器注意力模块实现特征查询和整合，采用重要性退火和跨解码器梯度阻断的训练策略。

Result: 在九物种肽测序基准测试中，模型显著超越了自回归和非自回归基线，成功融合了自回归的稳定性与非自回归的上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了生物序列建模技术，为增强自回归模型的双向理解能力提供了一种新颖的架构范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MORE框架，通过直接重新平衡模型参数空间来缓解长尾识别问题，使用低秩参数组件和正弦重加权调度，不增加模型复杂度或推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾识别在深度学习和基础模型微调中普遍存在且具有挑战性，偏斜的类别分布阻碍了模型对尾部类别的泛化能力。现有方法在如多标签长尾识别等广泛场景中难以取得一致改进。

Method: 提出模型重新平衡框架MORE，引入低秩参数组件来调节参数空间分配，采用定制损失和正弦重加权调度，但不增加整体模型复杂度或推理成本。

Result: 在多样化的长尾基准测试中，包括多类和多标签任务，MORE显著改善了泛化能力，特别是对尾部类别，并能有效补充现有的不平衡缓解方法。

Conclusion: MORE作为长尾设置中的稳健即插即用模块具有潜力，通过直接重新平衡模型参数空间来缓解类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

TL;DR: 提出D-SINK框架，通过整合专门处理类别不平衡和标签噪声的辅助模型，提升深度学习模型在长尾噪声数据上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集常同时面临类别不平衡和标签噪声问题，现有方法单独处理这两个问题，但结合使用时会产生冲突。本文发现这两个问题在不同粒度上运作，因此可以互补解决。

Method: 提出D-SINK框架，使用最优传输优化的代理标签分配，将目标模型的样本级预测与噪声鲁棒辅助模型对齐，将类别分布与不平衡鲁棒辅助模型对齐。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，D-SINK显著提高了鲁棒性，在长尾噪声数据学习中取得了强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: 通过协同利用专门但'弱'的辅助模型，可以有效地解决类别不平衡和标签噪声的共存问题，D-SINK框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的船舶燃料消耗预测数据集和标准化基准，并首次在该领域应用TabPFN基础模型进行上下文学习，结果显示包含环境条件和时间上下文的模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航运业中燃料消耗和排放对经济效率和环境可持续性至关重要，但由于方法异质性和高质量数据集有限，难以直接比较建模方法。

Method: 引入并发布新数据集，定义标准化基准（表格回归和时间序列回归），并研究使用TabPFN基础模型进行上下文学习的应用。

Result: 所有评估模型都表现出色，包含环境条件的模型始终优于仅依赖船速的简单多项式基线。TabPFN略优于其他技术，包含时间上下文能提高准确性。

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

TL;DR: EVOR是一种可扩展的离线强化学习方法，通过结合表达性策略和价值函数，避免了蒸馏或BPTT的计算负担，在推理时通过拒绝采样实现高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL在机器人领域尚未充分发挥潜力，主要因为可扩展性问题。现有方法依赖BPTT（计算昂贵）或策略蒸馏（引入复合误差），需要开发不依赖这些技术的可扩展离线RL方法。

Method: EVOR通过流匹配学习最优正则化Q函数，在推理时通过拒绝采样对表达性价值函数进行策略提取，实现高效优化和计算可扩展搜索。

Result: 在多样化离线RL任务上，EVOR优于基线方法，证明了将表达性价值学习整合到离线RL中的益处。

Conclusion: EVOR提供了一种无需蒸馏或BPTT的可扩展离线RL方法，通过表达性价值函数和推理时策略提取实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PSCBMs方法，通过添加小型协方差预测模块，无需重新训练主干模型，就能为预训练的CBM添加概念间的多元正态分布建模，提高概念和目标准确性，特别是在干预场景下表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模概念依赖性的方法通常需要重新训练整个模型，这在无法访问原始数据或计算资源有限时不可行。

Method: 在预训练的CBM基础上添加小型协方差预测模块，构建概念间的多元正态分布，提出两种训练策略。

Result: 在真实世界数据上，PSCBMs在概念和目标准确性上一致达到或超过标准CBM，在干预场景下表现显著更好，且比从头训练类似随机模型更高效。

Conclusion: PSCBMs是一种轻量级方法，能够有效建模概念依赖关系，提升CBM性能，特别是在干预场景下，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了不确定性感知马尔可夫决策过程（UAMDP），将贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束规划相结合，用于波动环境中的顺序决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波动性高、风险大的顺序决策环境中，仅最大化期望收益是不够的，需要系统的不确定性管理方法。

Method: UAMDP框架结合贝叶斯预测、Thompson采样和条件风险价值约束规划，在闭环中更新潜在动态信念、采样可能未来并优化风险约束策略。

Result: 在高频股票交易和零售库存控制中，UAMDP将长期预测RMSE降低25%、sMAPE降低32%，交易夏普比率从1.54提升至1.74，最大回撤减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准概率建模、后验不确定性对齐探索和风险感知控制，为更安全、更盈利的顺序决策提供了稳健通用方法。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）是自回归大语言模型（AR-LLMs）的有前景替代方案，具有更高的推理吞吐量潜力。但需要专门的强化学习算法来使其在推理等关键任务上达到与AR-LLMs相当的性能。

Method: DMPO方法通过交叉熵优化将dLLM策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布进行匹配。针对小训练批次大小的实施挑战，提出了基于权重基线减法的新颖解决方案。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现出优越性能，无需监督微调，相比之前SOTA基线准确率提升高达42.9%，相比基础模型提升55.8%。

Conclusion: 分布匹配框架在提升dLLMs推理能力方面非常有效，DMPO为dLLMs的强化学习微调提供了理论依据和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

TL;DR: 该研究使用政治罗盘测试评估了8个主流大语言模型的政治偏见和刻板印象传播，发现所有模型都呈现一致的左倾政治倾向，且通过语言变化引发的隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在信息传播和决策过程中的作用日益重要，理解其政治偏见对于防止对公众舆论和民主进程产生不当影响至关重要。

Method: 采用二维政治罗盘测试评估模型固有政治倾向，使用角色提示探索显性刻板印象，并通过多语言版本测试揭示隐性刻板印象。

Result: 所有被调查模型都显示出一致的左倾政治倾向；不同模型的刻板印象性质和程度差异很大；隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显；大多数模型的隐性和显性刻板印象存在显著一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大语言模型中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用，表明模型对其固有偏见存在一定程度的透明度或"意识"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Jason Bohne,Pawel Polak,David Rosenberg,Brian Bloniarz,Gary Kazantsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Mix-和MoE-DPO框架，通过软混合模型和混合专家架构扩展DPO，使用随机变分推理方法，解决了标准DPO在异构偏好分布和多任务设置中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了在多任务设置中的表达能力以及对异构或多样化偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 引入基于专家分配的潜变量模型，优化变分证据下界，支持共享基础架构与专家特定策略头以及完全独立的专家模型。

Result: 在多种模型规模和多偏好数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了Mix-和MoE-DPO作为偏好对齐的强大可扩展方法。

Conclusion: Mix-和MoE-DPO提供了比标准DPO更好的泛化能力、奖励和策略专业化以及上下文对齐能力。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文解决了从观测数据中进行高维多元结果反事实识别的开放性问题，建立了基于连续时间流的多元反事实识别理论基础，确保因果推断的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实推断方法缺乏识别性，削弱了因果估计的有效性。Pearl指出反事实必须可识别才能证明因果主张，因此需要建立可靠的识别框架。

Method: 使用连续时间流匹配方法，在标准准则下包括非马尔可夫设置，结合动态最优传输工具，构建唯一、单调且保持排名的反事实传输映射。

Result: 在具有反事实真实值的受控场景中验证了理论，并在真实图像上展示了反事实公理合理性的改进。

Conclusion: 建立了基于流匹配的多元反事实识别框架，确保了反事实推断的一致性和因果有效性。

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将物理定律层次结构嵌入深度生成模型的分层框架，通过傅里叶神经算子和条件流匹配实现物理约束的时间序列生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列生成方法往往忽略领域特定的物理约束，限制了统计和物理一致性，需要将物理定律的层次结构直接整合到生成模型中。

Method: 结合傅里叶神经算子学习物理算子，条件流匹配进行概率生成，通过时间依赖的分层约束和FNO引导的修正进行集成。

Result: 在谐振子、人体活动识别和锂离子电池退化实验中，生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测精度提升18.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将物理信息归纳偏置引入生成模型，显著提升了生成质量和物理一致性，为物理约束的时间序列生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出将自适应随机森林(ARFs)和漂移感知特征重要性(DAFI)结合，为6G网络构建灵活的AI方法，能够在动态环境中适应特征变化并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI成为6G网络控制的核心组件，AI模型需要适应持续变化的环境，包括多供应商部署、硬件升级和服务需求演进带来的新特征和测量指标。

Method: 采用自适应随机森林(ARFs)进行动态特征适应，并提出漂移感知特征重要性(DAFI)方法，使用分布漂移检测器来决定何时应用计算密集的特征重要性方法。

Result: 迭代训练ARFs能够实现稳定预测，随着特征增加准确率逐步提升。在3个不同数据集上的测试表明，DAFI方法将运行时间减少最多2倍，同时产生更一致的特征重要性值。

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI共同提供了一个有前景的框架，用于构建适应6G网络用例的灵活AI方法。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式机器学习中对抗行为的容忍问题，现有方法要么依赖中央服务器，要么通信成本过高。

Method: 采用基于拉取的流行病通信策略，从随机节点子集拉取模型参数，不依赖中央服务器。

Result: 在对抗性环境中保持鲁棒性，通信成本显著降低，准确性与全连接通信相当，可扩展性强。

Conclusion: RPEL提供了一种可扩展的分布式鲁棒学习解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低通信开销。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Learning to Ask (LtA)框架，解决传统Learning to Defer (LtD)的局限性，不仅决定何时求助专家，还考虑如何整合专家输入，通过两阶段模型架构实现更灵活的人机协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LtD方法将人类和ML模型视为互斥决策者，限制了专家贡献仅为预测。需要开发更有效的人机协作系统，充分利用专家知识。

Method: 提出LtA框架，包含标准ML模型和增强模型（训练时加入专家反馈），设计两种实现：顺序训练和联合训练，并为后者设计具有可实现一致性保证的代理损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实专家数据上的实验表明，LtA为人机协作提供了更灵活和强大的基础。

Conclusion: LtA框架通过同时处理何时和如何整合专家输入，超越了传统LtD方法，为有效的人机协作提供了新范式。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，该能力对棋盘游戏式推理至关重要，旨在理解模型如何预测输入序列中缺失的token。

Method: 理论分析单层注意力Transformer的维度边界和平衡logit位移条件；机制分析softmax压缩和训练噪声问题；提出dropout和EMA解决方案；在集合补集任务和OthelloGPT上进行实验验证。

Result: 证明了单层注意力Transformer的紧致维度边界；发现平衡logit位移可实现长度泛化但精度降低；验证了dropout和EMA能有效改善泛化性能；在OthelloGPT中EMA再次提升了长度泛化。

Conclusion: Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化受softmax压缩和训练噪声限制，dropout和EMA是有效的改善策略，为理解Transformer泛化机制提供了理论洞见。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

TL;DR: DeepEN是一个基于深度强化学习的个性化肠内营养推荐框架，针对ICU危重患者提供每4小时的热量、蛋白质和液体摄入建议，相比传统方法可降低3.7%的死亡率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于指南或启发式的肠内营养方法无法充分适应危重患者不断变化的生理状态，需要更个性化的数据驱动方法来改善患者预后。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库中11,000多名ICU患者数据离线训练，采用带保守Q学习正则化的决斗双深度Q网络，结合临床信息的状态空间和定制奖励函数。

Result: DeepEN在各项指标上优于临床医生和指南策略，死亡率从22.5%降至18.8%，关键营养生物标志物得到改善。

Conclusion: 研究表明，安全的数据驱动个性化肠内营养治疗有潜力超越传统方法，显著改善危重患者预后。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了掩码扩散模型采样过程中的不可逆决策问题，通过可学习的重掩码机制实现了更高效的生成。

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，MoE-based LoRA变体虽然能缓解单任务内的相关性，但在多任务模型合并中仍存在任务间干扰，且需要额外路由器参数。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1）在up-projection矩阵中引入rank-wise专家激活；2）用隐式路由器统一专家路由和down-projection，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统可训练密集版本。

Result: 在通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成四个领域的广泛实验表明，FlyLoRA相比现有方法取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅提供了实证收益，还展示了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新，其设计通过随机矩阵的正交性固有地缓解了任务间干扰。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Motivation: 当前牙本质孔隙成像受限于共聚焦显微镜的分辨率与视野范围，需要开发能够通过低分辨率图像恢复高质量图像的超分辨率方法。

Method: 使用三种有监督2D超分辨率模型（RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN）和一种无监督模型（CycleGAN），在实验配对的低分辨率和高分辨率共聚焦图像上进行测试，像素尺寸增加2、4、8倍。

Result: 传统图像质量评估指标结果不一致且与视觉感知矛盾，而基于孔隙网络特定结构和3D连通性的生物学驱动评估能更好解释模型性能差异。

Conclusion: 针对特定生物结构（如牙本质孔隙）的超分辨率评估需要采用基于生物学特性的定制化方法，而非通用的图像质量评估指标。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

*Stella C. Dong,James R. Finlay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ClauseLens是一个基于条款的强化学习框架，用于生成透明、合规且风险感知的再保险条约报价，显著减少违规并提高风险管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约定价实践不透明且难以审计，需要满足严格的监管标准，因此需要开发能够产生透明、合规报价的系统。

Method: 将报价任务建模为风险感知约束马尔可夫决策过程(RA-CMDP)，从法律和承保语料库中检索法规和政策条款，嵌入到智能体观察中，用于约束可行行动并生成基于条款的自然语言解释。

Result: 在多代理条约模拟器中评估，ClauseLens将偿付能力违规减少51%，尾部风险表现提高27.9%(CVaR_0.10)，条款解释准确率达到88.2%，检索精度87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律背景嵌入决策和解释路径可以产生符合Solvency II、NAIC RBC和欧盟AI法案的可解释、可审计且监管一致的报价行为。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，通过强化学习训练智能路由器，在成本与性能之间实现最佳平衡，无需手动设计路由规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：高端模型性能强但昂贵，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。静态升级规则和关键词启发式方法无法充分利用这一频谱且难以跨任务类型适应。

Method: 使用强化学习端到端训练路由器，采用明确的成本感知奖励函数来编码成本-性能权衡，路由器可以直接回答或调用外部模型。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（如在相似任务完成率下显著降低成本），并提供了关于学习路由可靠帮助因素的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter为推进学习型、成本感知的LLM编排提供了实用基础，这些发现和开源实现将促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

TL;DR: 提出了动态不确定性感知的Divide2Conquer方法，通过基于验证集性能动态加权子集模型的贡献来改进聚合过程，有效对抗过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准D2C方法在聚合时对所有子集模型采用平等或固定启发式权重，未能充分利用各模型泛化能力的差异信息。

Method: DUA-D2C基于共享验证集上子集模型的准确率和预测不确定性，动态调整其权重，让中心模型优先学习泛化能力更强、预测更自信的边缘模型。

Result: 在多个领域的基准数据集上，DUA-D2C显著改善了泛化性能，即使在应用其他正则化方法的基础上也能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一种理论上有依据且有效的对抗现代深度学习过拟合的方法。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Conclusion: 系列符号数据生成和预训练机制在克服数据稀缺和提升任务性能方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

Motivation: GNNs在消息传递机制中面临过度压缩问题，即来自大感受野的节点信息被压缩到固定大小的向量中，造成信息瓶颈。作者希望从存储和检索容量的角度重新理解这一问题。

Method: 作者研究了现有测量过度压缩任务的局限性，提出了新的合成任务来展示信息瓶颈如何饱和容量。受序列建模中联想记忆、快速权重编程和xLSTM模型的启发，开发了一种具有改进容量的新型GNN架构。

Result: 新架构在容量合成任务和一系列真实世界图基准测试中都表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 通过从存储和检索容量的角度重新审视过度压缩问题，并借鉴序列建模的先进技术，可以开发出具有更好性能的GNN架构。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个九维积分特征框架来严格分类激活函数，结合高斯传播统计、渐近斜率和正则性度量，建立了良定性、仿射重参数化定律和闭包性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数比较大多基于启发式方法，缺乏严格的分类框架来指导激活函数的选择和设计。

Method: 使用九维积分特征S_sigma(phi)，包含高斯传播统计(m1,g1,g2,m2,eta)、渐近斜率(alpha_plus,alpha_minus)和正则性度量(TV(phi'),C(phi))。

Result: 对8种标准激活函数进行了分类，证明了饱和、线性增长和平滑族之间的明显区别，数值验证支持理论预测。

Conclusion: 该框架为激活函数选择提供了原则性设计指导，将激活函数选择从试错方法转向可证明的稳定性和核条件化。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

TL;DR: 提出SummDiff方法，首次将扩散模型应用于视频摘要任务，将视频摘要重新定义为条件生成问题，能够生成多个反映不同人类视角的合理摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法确定性地回归多个标注者的平均帧分数，忽略了任务固有的主观性，无法反映不同人类对好摘要的多样化观点。

Method: 采用扩散模型，将视频摘要构建为条件生成任务，模型学习好摘要的分布，根据输入视频动态适应视觉上下文并生成多个候选摘要。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，生成的摘要与个体标注者偏好更接近，并通过背包问题分析提供了新的评估指标。

Conclusion: SummDiff不仅性能优越，还能更好地捕捉视频摘要的主观性本质，为评估提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

Motivation: 传统聚类算法受限于预定义的相似性度量，无法灵活捕捉输入之间的复杂关系。本文旨在探索LLM在无监督聚类任务中的潜力，利用其注意力机制和上下文学习能力。

Method: 使用预训练LLM的注意力矩阵进行谱聚类，并通过Next Token Prediction (NTP)损失对数值和图像数据进行微调，支持文本条件图像聚类。

Result: LLM在文本编码的数值数据上表现出令人印象深刻的零样本聚类能力，注意力矩阵显示出明显的聚类模式，谱聚类性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: ICC将上下文学习扩展到无监督设置，展示了LLM在聚类任务中的有效性和灵活性，为传统聚类方法提供了新的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

Method: 提出UML框架，单一模型交替处理不同模态输入，共享参数，利用不同模态是共享现实投影的假设。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下，未配对辅助数据能产生比单模态训练更具信息量的表示；实证表明使用文本、音频或图像等未配对数据能持续提升图像和音频等单模态任务性能。

Conclusion: UML证明了未配对多模态数据能有效增强单模态表示学习，为利用丰富但未配对的跨模态数据提供了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

Motivation: 现有的分布式机器学习批量大小选择方法采用静态分配或简单启发式策略，无法适应异构动态计算环境的需求。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过多维状态表示（网络指标、系统资源利用率、训练统计效率指标）和PPO算法进行批量大小优化决策。

Result: 在多样化工作负载、硬件配置和网络条件下，DYNAMIX实现了最终模型精度提升6.3%，总训练时间减少46%。在32节点集群上保持最佳性能，学习策略能有效跨模型架构迁移。

Conclusion: DYNAMIX无需显式系统建模，能与现有分布式训练框架无缝集成，在异构环境中实现高效的自适应批量大小优化。

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架为策略优化提供了收敛保证和可解释性，同时保持策略多样性，是强化学习理论的重要进展。

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

Conclusion: 为RLVR提供了理论基础，揭示了其成功的关键机制和收敛条件，对实际应用具有指导意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有并行生成和迭代优化的优势，但现有RL微调方法存在偏差（如diffu-GRPO）或计算成本过高（ELBO方法）的问题。

Method: 重新审视ELBO估计，分解其方差来源，通过快速确定性积分近似减少方差，提出Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)算法。

Conclusion: GDPO通过降低ELBO估计器方差，为扩散语言模型的RL微调提供了有效的解决方案，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Method: 构建Linearizer架构：f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))，其中A是线性算子，g_x和g_y是可逆神经网络，通过它们定义新的向量空间加法和缩放操作。

Result: 成功将SVD、伪逆、正交投影等线性代数工具应用于非线性映射；两个共享神经网络的Linearizer组合仍为Linearizer；在扩散模型中实现数百步采样压缩为单步采样；构建全局投影生成模型和模块化风格迁移。

Conclusion: Linearizer框架为非线性函数提供了线性表示，扩展了线性代数的应用范围，在生成模型和风格迁移等任务中展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.
