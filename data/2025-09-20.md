### [1] [Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14420)
*Zhicheng Lin,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的类不变测试时增强技术(CI-TTA)，通过弹性和网格变形生成多个输入图像变体，并使用符合预测结果过滤和聚合，在不增加训练或计算复杂度的情况下提升域适配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在分布偏移下性能显著下降，传统域适配方法需要多域训练或高计算复杂度的测试时适应，需要一种轻量级的补充策略来提升模型的突然适配能力。

Method: 提出Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation(CI-TTA)技术，通过弹性和网格变形生成多个输入图像变体，这些变体保持与原始输入同一类别。使用信心度导向的过滤方案离除不可靠的输出，确保最终决策依赖一致和可靠的线索。

Result: 在PACS和Office-Home数据集上进行了大量实验，证明该方法在不同的域适配算法和背锁网络上都能一致提升性能，显示了方法的有效性和普遍性。

Conclusion: CI-TTA作为一种轻量级的测试时增强技术，可以有效地补充现有域适配方法，在不增加训练或计算复杂度的情况下显著提升模型在未见域上的性能。

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### [2] [AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476)
*Jiasen Lu,Liangchen Song,Mingze Xu,Byeongjoo Ahn,Yanjun Wang,Chen Chen,Afshin Dehghan,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AToken是首个统一的视觉tokenizer，能够在图像、视频和3D资产上同时实现高保真重建和语义理解，通过4D潜在空间统一多种模态和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有tokenizer要么专注于单模态的重建任务，要么专注于理解任务，缺乏一个能够统一处理多种视觉模态并同时支持重建和理解任务的框架。

Method: 采用纯transformer架构和4D旋转位置编码来处理任意分辨率和时长的视觉输入，使用无对抗训练目标结合感知损失和Gram矩阵损失，采用渐进式训练课程从单图像扩展到视频和3D。

Result: 在图像上达到0.21 rFID和82.2% ImageNet准确率，视频上达到3.01 rFVD和32.6% MSRVTT检索率，3D上达到28.19 PSNR和90.9%分类准确率，在下游生成和理解任务中都表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: AToken展示了统一视觉tokenization在构建下一代多模态AI系统中的潜力，为同时支持视觉生成和理解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

### [3] [MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14544)
*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MemEvo方法解决增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性困境，通过模拟海马体-前额叶皮层协作记忆机制，实现新知识获取与历史知识保留的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性困境(SPD)，模型需要足够可塑性适应新数据，同时保持足够稳定性巩固长期知识并防止灾难性遗忘

Method: 1) 海马体启发的视图对齐模块：通过连续表示中的结构对齐捕获新视图增益信息；2) 认知遗忘机制：模拟人类记忆衰减模式调节历史知识权重；3) 前额叶皮层启发的知识巩固内存模块：利用时间张量稳定性逐步巩固历史知识

Result: 在视图数量增长场景中展现出强大的知识保留能力，大量实验证明MemEvo相比现有最先进方法具有显著优势

Conclusion: MemEvo通过神经科学启发的记忆机制成功解决了增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性平衡问题，为持续学习场景提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过边缘导向的注意力机制和轻量殊常设计，实现了更高结构锐度和感知质量的单图超分辨率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有边缘感知方法存在的冗余、优化不稳定和结构收益有限等问题，提高单图超分辨率的结构保真性

Method: 边缘导向注意力机制，从联合编码的边缘特征和中间特征激活派生自适应调制地图，进行归一化和重新加权，同时采用轻量殊常设计和组合损失函数（像素、感知、对抗）

Result: 在标准SISR测试集上正式提升了结构锐度和感知质量，超过SRGAN、ESRGAN等方法，且模型复杂度相当

Conclusion: 结构保真的边缘条件调制方法能够有效提升感知超分辨率的性能，提供了参数高效、优化稳定的解决方案

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

### [5] [Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14560)
*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于评分模型的适应性迭代点云去噪方法，通过噪声估计和适应调度实现高效去噪，在保持形状边界和细节的同时获得清漏平滑的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要经验性重复迭代去噪过程，无法高效处理不同水平或模式的噪声。

Method: 使用评分模型，首先估计噪声变异并确定适应性去噪调度，然后迭代调用训练网络更新点云。设计了两阶段采样策略来支持特征融合和梯度融合。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实扫描数据集上都获得优称性能，既在质量上也在数量上超过现有最佳方法，能够保持形状边界和细节。

Conclusion: 该方法通过适应性迭代去噪过程，有效地处理了不同水平和模式的噪声，为点云去噪任务提供了一种更加高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [6] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffVL是一个基于扩散模型的视觉定位框架，将视觉定位重新定义为GPS去噪任务，通过联合建模GPS、标准地图和视觉信号，实现亚米级精度而无需高精地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法面临高精地图成本高、标准地图方法忽略GPS噪声的问题。GPS在城市场景中存在多径误差，但现有方法未能有效利用这一普遍存在的噪声信号。

Method: 提出DiffVL框架，使用扩散模型将噪声GPS轨迹与视觉BEV特征和标准地图结合，通过迭代扩散细化恢复真实位姿分布，学习逆转GPS噪声扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，该方法相比BEV匹配基线方法达到了最先进的精度水平，实现了亚米级定位精度。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够通过将噪声GPS作为生成先验来实现可扩展的定位，这代表了从传统基于匹配方法向生成式方法的范式转变。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [7] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DICE框架将扩散模型与数据一致性约束相结合，通过双代理共识平衡机制在稀疏视图CT重建中实现高质量图像重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT重建是一个病态逆问题，传统方法难以捕捉医学图像的复杂结构，而扩散模型作为强大的生成先验可以准确建模复杂图像分布

Method: 提出Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium (DICE)框架，通过交替执行数据一致性代理（近端算子确保测量一致性）和先验代理（扩散模型进行干净图像估计）来实现共识平衡

Result: 在15、30、60视图（总共180视图）的均匀和非均匀稀疏视图设置下，DICE显著优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: DICE有效结合了强大的生成先验能力和测量一致性约束，在稀疏视图CT重建中表现出卓越的效果和鲁棒性

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

*Takamasa Yamaguchi,Brian Kenji Iwana,Ryoma Bise,Shota Harada,Takumi Okuo,Kiyohito Tanaka,Kaito Shiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督域适应方法，利用患者级诊断结果作为目标域的弱监督，通过共享聚合令牌和最大严重性三元组损失来解决溃疡性结肠炎严重程度估计中的域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 溃疡性结肠炎严重程度估计方法常因不同医院的成像设备和临床设置差异而遭受域偏移问题，现有域适应方法在目标域缺乏监督或标注成本高的情况下表现不佳。

Method: 使用患者级诊断结果作为弱监督，采用共享聚合令牌和最大严重性三元组损失来对齐跨域的类分布，利用患者级诊断由最严重区域决定的特点。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于比较的域适应方法，在域偏移设置下改善了溃疡性结肠炎严重程度估计。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督域适应方法有效解决了域偏移问题，利用常规记录的患者级诊断信息作为弱监督，提高了溃疡性结肠炎严重程度估计的准确性。

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个包含100张蒙特利尔街道图像的小型基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在城市感知任务中的表现，发现模型在客观属性识别上表现优于主观评价


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人们如何阅读城市场景可以为设计和规划提供信息，需要测试视觉语言模型在城市感知任务中的能力

Method: 使用100张图像（50张照片+50张合成场景），12名参与者提供230份标注，评估7个VLMs的零样本性能，使用准确率和Jaccard重叠度作为评估指标

Result: 最佳系统(claude-sonnet)在多标签项目上达到宏观0.31和平均Jaccard 0.48，模型在可见客观属性上表现更好，合成图像略微降低分数

Conclusion: 发布了可复现的基准测试和工具，用于参与式城市分析中的不确定性感知评估

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

### [10] [Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591)
*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于特征对齐运动变换框架(FMT)的动态点云压缩方法，通过隐式模型化时间变化替代显式运动估计，实现更高的压缩效率和处理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态点云在沉浸式实际、机器人学等领域应用广泛，但其不规则结构和局部变化使运动估计和补偿极其困难，现有方法的显式运动估计无法充分抓取复杂动态和利用时间相关性

Method: 提出特征对齐运动变换(FMT)框架，用时空对齐策略替代显式运动向量，隐式模型连续时间变化，并在潜在空间中使用对齐特征作为时间上下文进行条件编码，设计了支持双向运动引用和分层编码的随机访问引用策略

Result: 在编码和解码效率方面超过D-DPCC和AdaDPCC方法，实现了相应的BD-Rate降低(20%和9.4%)，显著提升了压缩效率

Conclusion: FMT框架通过隐式模型化时间变化和特征对齐策略，有效解决了动态点云压缩中运动估计的挑战，同时支持帧级并行压缩，在压缩效率和处理性能方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

### [11] [HybridMamba: A Dual-domain Mamba for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14609)
*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridMamba是一个用于3D医学图像分割的新架构，通过双互补机制平衡局部和全局特征表示，在MRI和CT数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba在3D生物医学图像分割中表现出色，但过度关注全局上下文建模会损害关键局部结构信息，导致分割结果的边界模糊和区域失真。

Method: 提出HybridMamba架构，采用双互补机制：1）特征扫描策略，通过轴向遍历和局部自适应路径渐进整合表示；2）结合空间-频率分析的门控模块进行全面的上下文建模。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上的实验表明，HybridMamba在3D医学图像分割方面显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: HybridMamba通过有效平衡局部和全局特征表示，解决了现有方法的局限性，在医学图像分割任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

*Yue Cao,Quansong He,Kaishen Wang,Jianlong Xiong,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态跳跃连接(DSC)模块解决U型网络中传统跳跃连接的两个限制：特征间约束和特征内约束，通过测试时训练和动态多尺度核实现自适应特征融合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跳跃连接存在静态特征融合和缺乏多尺度特征交互的问题，限制了医学图像分割的性能提升

Method: DSC模块包含两个组件：测试时训练(TTT)模块实现动态特征适应，动态多尺度核(DMSK)模块基于全局上下文自适应选择核大小

Result: DSC模块可即插即用地集成到各种U型网络中，在CNN、Transformer、混合架构和Mamba-based网络上均表现出有效性

Conclusion: 提出的DSC模块通过动态自适应机制显著增强了跨层连接性，为医学图像分割提供了通用的性能提升方案

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

Conclusion: LSTC-MDA通过改进时间建模和数据多样性，有效解决了骨架动作识别的关键挑战，为相关研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

Result: 实验表明，使用MultiEdit-Train集微调基础开源模型显著提高了模型在提出的MultiEdit-Test基准测试中对复杂编辑任务的性能，同时有效保持了在标准编辑基准上的能力。

Conclusion: MultiEdit为推进更多样化和挑战性的基于指令的图像编辑能力研究提供了宝贵资源，该数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse
and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available at

TL;DR: 通过新的Attention Lattice Adapter和Alternating Epoch Architect机制，提出了一种可适配复杂视觉基础模型的解释生成方法，显著提升了解释质量和模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解释生成方法缺乏适配性，无法应用于复杂模型，需要一种新的方法来充分解释视觉基础模型的决策过程。

Method: 提出了Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA)机制自动处理层选择，以及Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA)机制通过间隔更新参数来解决关注区域过小的问题。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和ImageNet-S数据集上，方法在均值交并比(IoU)、插入分数、删除分数和插入-删除分数等指标上都超过了基线方法，在CUB-200-2011上均值IoU提升了53.2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提升了视觉基础模型的可解释性，通过自动化的注意力模块调整和参数更新策略，为复杂模型提供了高质量的解释生成能力。

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

TL;DR: DACoN是一个利用基础模型提取部件级语义特征，结合CNN空间特征进行精细特征提取的线稿自动上色框架，支持任意数量参考图像，解决了遮挡、姿态变化和视角变化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习自动上色方法在处理遮挡、姿态变化和视角变化时存在困难，且通常只能支持1-2张参考图像，限制了上色效果。

Method: 提出DACoN框架，利用基础模型提取部件级语义特征，与CNN提取的高分辨率空间特征融合，实现精细且鲁棒的特征提取，并移除了对参考图像数量的限制。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，使用多个参考图像能够获得更优越的上色性能。

Conclusion: DACoN通过融合基础模型的语义特征和CNN的空间特征，支持任意数量参考图像，显著提升了线稿自动上色的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMGS-Avatar是一种从单目视频重建高保真可动画人体化身的创新方法，通过网格引导的2D高斯泼溅和基础模型知识蒸馏，解决了现有方法在表面细节保持和信息不足方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频重建高保真可动画人体化身面临几何信息不足的挑战。现有的3D高斯泼溅方法由于3D高斯基元的自由形式特性，难以保持表面细节。

Method: 提出FMGS-Avatar方法，包含两个关键创新：1) 网格引导的2D高斯泼溅，将2D高斯基元直接附加到模板网格面上，约束位置、旋转和移动；2) 利用在大型数据集上训练的基础模型（如Sapiens）补充单目视频的有限视觉线索，并通过选择性梯度隔离的协调训练策略解决多模态先验知识蒸馏中的优化目标冲突。

Result: 实验评估显示，与现有方法相比，该方法在重建质量方面表现优越，在几何精度和外观保真度方面有显著提升，同时提供丰富的语义信息。蒸馏的先验知识在共享规范空间中自然支持新颖视角和姿态下空间和时间一致的渲染。

Conclusion: 通过增强表示和协调信息蒸馏的结合，该方法显著推进了3D单目人体化身重建技术，解决了表示限制和信息稀缺的双重挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Motivation: 现有方法将多模态大语言模型仅用于评估，没有充分利用其丰富的多模态推理能力，导致图像检索性能次优

Method: 设计了链式思绩重排名方法（CoTRR），包括列表排名提示、图像评估提示和查询解构提示，让MLLM直接参与候选图像的重排名过程

Result: 在5个数据集上进行了广泛实验，在文本到图像检索（TIR）、组合图像检索（CIR）和聊天基于图像检索（Chat-IR）三个任务上都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: CoTRR方法充分发挥了多模态大语言模型的多模态推理能力，通过直接参与重排名过程，显著提升了图像检索的准确性和可解释性

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

Result: 融合合成数据能够提高检测性能，利用液化模型的大规模预训练提供了有前景的方法

Conclusion: 该方法在标签稀少且获取成本高的小众应用中特别有效，即使数据量较小也能实现效果，扩大规模有更大潜力

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

Result: 证实了帧采样偏差的存在，发现SVLM在不同帧采样技术下呈现数据特定和任务特定的行为

Conclusion: 需要为每个评测数据集制定标准化的帧采样策略，并提供可复现的无偏评测协议

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

Motivation: 解决现有参数化点云表示方法中的两难问题：高适应性模型（如样条曲面或二次曲面）计算成本高，而实时方法（如高斯混合模型或平面）自由度低、难以用少数基元达到高精度。

Method: 1. 首先使用高斯混合模型将点云分割成多个聚类。 2. 选择平坦聚类并合并成平面或曲面。 3. 平面通过2D音符基于边界描述方法进行拟合和定界。 4. 曲面通过B样条曲面拟合，使用同样的边界描述方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高效率高精度的实时参数化点云表示，在内存效率映射和多机器人协作任务中具有应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需类标签或预训练SR模型的新型数据萌蓬方法，通过CLIP特征分类和模型微调生成高质量训练图像，在仅使用0.68%数据的情况下仍能保持性能仅下降0.3dB，训练时间大幅缩短


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练需要大量数据和计算资源，数据萌蓬技术可提高数据利用效率。现有GAN逆向数据萌蓬方法依赖预训练SR模型和类别信息，限制了通用性

Method: 首先提取高梯度补丁并使用CLIP特征进行图像分类，然后对选择的补丁微调渗透模型以学习其分布并合成萌蓬训练图像

Result: 在仅使用0.68%原始数据集的情况下，性能仅下降0.3dB，达到状态前沿性能。渗透模型微调耗4小时，SR模型训练耗1小时，远短于使用全量数据的11小时训练时间

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、通用的数据萌蓬方案，能够在大幅减少训练数据和计算成本的同时保持高性能，为深度学习的数据效率提升提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成方法在3D CT生成中主要依赖简化的提示词，忽略了放射学报告中丰富的语义细节，导致文本-图像对齐度和临床保真度降低。

Method: 提出Report2CT框架，整合三个预训练的医学文本编码器（BiomedVLP CXR BERT、MedEmbed、ClinicalBERT）来捕捉临床上下文，使用放射学报告和体素间距信息条件化3D潜在扩散模型，在CT RATE数据集的20000个CT体积上进行训练。

Result: 生成的CT体积具有解剖一致性和优秀的视觉质量，多编码器条件化提高了CLIP分数，分类器自由引导进一步增强了文本-图像对齐，在MICCAI 2025 VLM3D挑战赛中排名第一并在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用完整的放射学报告和多编码器文本条件化，Report2CT推进了3D CT合成技术，能够生成临床保真度高、质量优秀的合成数据。

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测地线活动轮廓模型在骨分割中存在特征提取不区分、难以处理边缘阻塞、边缘泄漏和骨折现象的问题，需要一种能够更好捕捉骨特征并稳健处理骨折和软组织的算法。

Method: 结合骨科知识构建新型边缘检测函数（强度+梯度范数），引入可嵌入骨折提示的距离信息作为自适应步长来稳定轮廓演化，使轮廓能够在骨边缘和骨折处准确停止。

Conclusion: 该骨折交互式测地线活动轮廓算法通过结合领域知识和深度神经网络，为骨分割提供了更准确和稳健的解决方案，特别是在处理骨折区域方面表现出色。

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Conclusion: MED损失函数有效解决了学习式皮层表面重建中的变形能量优化和训练一致性问题，为神经影像分析提供了更可靠的皮层重建方法。

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

Conclusion: ProtoMedX在保持高准确性的同时提供临床可理解的解释，满足医疗AI对透明度和可解释性的要求

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their
geocoordinates. Incidents such as graffiti or road damage are also relevant. As
digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date
databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces
MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic

*Hongjun Wang,Jiyuan Chen,Zhengwei Yin,Xuan Song,Yinqiang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对图像超分辨率中噪声过拟合问题的特征去噪框架，包含噪声检测和去噪模块，可无缝集成到现有模型中，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现模型在超分辨率任务中主要过拟合于噪声而非所有退化类型，因为噪声具有与其他退化类型不同的独特模式，需要针对性地解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了包含噪声检测和去噪模块的特征去噪框架，能够识别并抑制噪声相关的特征，同时保留图像内容特征，无需修改现有模型架构。

Result: 在5个传统基准测试和数据集（包括合成和真实场景）上，该方法优于之前的基于正则化的方法，表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决图像超分辨率中的噪声过拟合问题提供了有效的通用解决方案，能够显著提升模型在未知退化条件下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本工作复现了Faithful Vision Transformers (FViTs)的结果，研究了Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS)对Vision Transformers可解释性鲁棒性的提升效果，并扩展了原始研究范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证arXiv:2311.17983论文中关于DDS能够提高Vision Transformers在分割任务和分类任务中对抗攻击鲁棒性的主张，并扩展研究DDS对其他可解释性方法的普适性效果。

Method: 使用Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS)技术，在基线方法和新提出的Attribution Rollout方法上进行测试，同时测量计算成本和环境影响。

Result: 结果总体上与原始研究一致，但也发现并讨论了一些细微差异。

Conclusion: DDS技术确实能够提升Vision Transformers的可解释性鲁棒性，但需要权衡计算成本和环境影响。

Abstract: This work aims to reproduce the results of Faithful Vision Transformers
(FViTs) proposed by arXiv:2311.17983 alongside interpretability methods for
Vision Transformers from arXiv:2012.09838 and Xu (2022) et al. We investigate
claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a
segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We
also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution
Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and
environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly
agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were
found and discussed.

*Wonduk Seo,Minhyeong Yu,Hyunjin An,Seunghyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARIC是一个多智能体框架，将图像分类重新定义为协作推理过程，通过多个智能体从不同视角分析图像并综合结果，显著提升了分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像分类方法需要大量参数训练和标注数据，而现有的视觉语言模型依赖单一表示，难以捕捉视觉内容的互补方面。需要一种能够分解任务并从多角度进行推理的方法

Method: MARIC框架包含四个智能体：Outliner Agent分析图像全局主题并生成针对性提示；三个Aspect Agent从不同视觉维度提取细粒度描述；Reasoning Agent通过集成反思步骤综合这些互补输出，生成统一表示进行分类

Result: 在4个不同的图像分类基准数据集上的实验表明，MARIC显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 多智能体视觉推理对于实现鲁棒且可解释的图像分类非常有效，MARIC框架成功缓解了参数密集型训练和单一VLM推理的缺点

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

Motivation: 解决人像图片中个人身份信息保护的需求，同时确保匿名化后的图片仍能够有效支撑下游计算机视觉任务的运行。

Method: 利用潜在滿射模型的绘画能力，设计适应性属性导向模块，在反向去噪过程中应用梯度纠正，使生成图像的面部属性与合成目标图像对齐，支持局部匿名化功能。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和FFHQ公开数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该方法在不需额外模型训练的情况下，性能超越了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该统一框架通过控制匿名化过程生成了高质量的匿名化人像图片，同时保持了下游任务的可用性，为人像图片匿名化提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

Motivation: 个体化疗效预测面临挑战，病患者对治疗的响应存在显著差异，需要从早期影像动态中学习有效表征

Method: 使用多任务模型学习MRI数据的时序变化轨迹，模型考虑外观表现、时间连续性和非响应者的异质性

Result: 在ISPY-2数据集上：仅用治前数据(T0)平衡准确率0.761，早期响应(T0+T1)0.811，四个时间点(T0->T3)0.861

Conclusion: 通过学习早期治疗响应的动态轨迹表征，可以有效预测乳腺癌病理完全缓解，为个体化治疗决策提供支持

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

<details>

Motivation: 实际太空任务中需要6D相对定位，但目前数据驱动的定位方法因其黑盒特性而难以被实际任务采纳，需要提供可解释性来理解网络的决策基础。

Method: 训练基于NeRF的图像生成器，通过将定位网络的梯度反向传播到生成器中，迫使生成器渲染出定位网络主要利用的3D特征。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够恢复关键的3D视觉线索，并提供了对定位网络监督方式与隐式表征关系的更深入见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为定位网络提供了可解释性的可视化方法，有助于推进数据驱动方法在实际太空任务中的应用。

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Conclusion: 伪标签训练和级联多模型推理方法在长复杂视频分割场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP基础模型在专业生物识别任务（人脸识别、形态攻击检测、呈现攻击检测）微调后会出现过度专业化问题，导致跨域泛化能力下降，特别是复杂任务和分类头设计影响遗忘程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型在高度专业化生物识别任务微调后是否会出现过度专业化问题，从而丧失其核心的跨域泛化能力。

Method: 系统评估三个CLIP实例（分别针对FR、MAD、PAD微调），在14个通用视觉数据集上进行零样本和线性探测评估，同时测试FR、MAD、PAD基准性能。

Result: 微调模型确实存在过度专业化，特别是复杂FR任务。FRoundation模型在IJB-C基准上提升58.52%，但在ImageNetV2上性能从69.84%降至51.63%。较大模型架构能更好保持原始泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型微调存在泛化能力与专业化性能的权衡，任务复杂度和分类头设计影响遗忘程度，增加模型容量有助于缓解过度专业化问题。

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Motivation: 现有检测模型主要关注简单的真实性分类，只能提供伪造概率或二元判断，缺乏对图像真实性的解释性洞察；而基于MLLM的检测方法虽然可提供更可解释的结果，但在纯真实性分类准确性方面仍落后于专家模型

Conclusion: DF-LLaVA是一个简单而有效的框架，能够同时实现出色的检测准确性和MLLMs提供的可解释性，为解决合成图像检测中的准确性和可解释性平衡问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Conclusion: CMGR框架通过有效整合几何和纹理信息，解决了3D类增量学习中的关键挑战，为开放世界场景的可扩展识别系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电商产品类别的快速增长，仓库自动化包装中的物体识别变得更加困难。类内变异性、长尾稀有物品、视觉相似物品、多样化包装、杂乱容器、频繁遮挡和大视角变化等因素导致查询图像和参考图像之间存在显著差异，仅依赖2D外观特征的方法性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RoboEye通过动态结合2D和3D特征，有效解决了大规模电商环境下的物体识别挑战，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了识别性能，为仓库自动化提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

Motivation: 现有的随机抓掩策略忽视了点云的几何结构和语义一致性，无法抓掩跨方向保持一致的空间关系和语义部件。

Method: 提出双流道抓掩方案：3D空间网格抓掩（通过坐标排序创建结构化模式）和渐进语义抓掩（使用注意力骤簇发现语义部件），通过课程学习动态协调。

Conclusion: 该方法作为即插即用组件，无需改动架构即可集成到现有旋转不变框架中，通过结构化抓掩策略有效改善了点云MAE的表现。

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline

TL;DR: EchoVLM是一个专门为超声医学影像设计的视觉语言模型，采用专家混合架构，在7个解剖区域数据上训练，能够执行超声报告生成、诊断和视觉问答等多任务，相比通用模型在超声报告生成任务上有显著提升。

Result: 在超声报告生成任务上，EchoVLM相比Qwen2-VL在BLEU-1和ROUGE-1分数上分别提升了10.15和4.77个点，表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: EchoVLM在提升超声影像诊断准确性方面具有巨大潜力，为未来临床应用提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多视角多模态滿散模型SpatialGen，用于生成高保真度的3D室内场景，解决了现有方法在视觉质量、多样性、语义一致性和用户控制方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动3D建模耗时耗力，而现有的自动场景生成方法在质量、一致性和控制性方面存在缺陷，主要瓶颈是缺乏大规模高质量的专用数据集。

Method: 首先构建了一个大规模综合性合成数据集，包含12,328个结构化注释场景、57,440个房间和470万张照相级渲染图。基于此数据集，提出SpatialGen模型，通过多视角多模态滿散方法，根据3D布局和参考图像，从任意视角生成外观、几何和语义分割图，保持多模态间的空间一致性。

Result: SpatialGen在实验中一贯生成优于之前方法的结果，能够生成高保真度、语义一致的3D室内场景。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内场景生成领域提供了重要的数据集和模型支持，开源数据和模型将有助于推动室内场景理解与生成领域的发展。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

*Arda Kabadayi,Senem Velipasalar,Jiajing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一个三阶段混合检索方法，结合视觉语言模型和像素级匹配，在零售产品检索中实现了4.21%的top-1准确率提升，同时保持实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统产品检索面临挑战：不同品牌的同类产品视觉相似度高，查询图像角度与目录图像差异大。基础模型难以区分细微局部差异，而像素匹配方法计算成本高、耗时过长。

Method: 三阶段混合方法：1) 使用SigLIP视觉语言模型检索前35个语义相似产品，大幅缩小搜索空间；2) 应用YOLO-E分割模型去除背景干扰；3) 在筛选后的候选产品上使用LightGlue进行细粒度像素级匹配。

Result: 在ABV数据集上的实验表明，PRISM在top-1准确率上比最先进的图像检索方法高出4.21%，同时仍保持在实时处理范围内，适合实际零售部署。

Conclusion: PRISM通过结合语义相似性检索和细粒度像素匹配的优势，有效解决了零售产品检索中的高类间相似性问题，在准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

correlation layer trained on synthetic data, providing the model with the
ability to effectively tackle the complex joint task of wire detection and
depth estimation. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
existing competitive approaches in the joint task of wire detection and depth
estimation. Our results underscore the potential of our model to enhance the
safety and precision of autonomous drones, shedding light on its promising
applications in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有水下图像生成模型主要关注变色问题，忽略了高混浊环境中距离相关的可见度损失，特别是前向散射项和非均匀介质的影响。

Method: 改进合成数据生成流程，包含前向散射项和非均匀介质；收集BUCKET数据集（控制混浊条件下的真实混浊图像及对应参考图像）。

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under
increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

<details>

Motivation: 临床实践中多模态MRI经常存在模态缺失问题，限制了依赖完整输入的深度学习方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在非主导模态组合情况下。

Method: 提出AdaMM框架，包含三个模块：图引导自适应精炼模块建模语义关联，双瓶颈蒸馏模块通过全局风格匹配和对抗特征对齐传递知识，病变存在引导可靠性模块通过辅助分类任务预测病变类型先验概率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态脑肿瘤分割中的模态缺失问题，知识蒸馏策略被证明具有优越性，为方法选择和未来研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 通过强化学习框架动态调整反散模型图像编辑的超参数，避免暴力搜索的高计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反散模型图像编辑方法需要用户手动暴力调整多个相互依赖的超参数，这个过程计算成本高且效率低

Method: 将超参数搜索模型为马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习框架（近端策略优化）动态调整去噪步骤中的超参数

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在搜索时间和计算开销上明显减少，较现有暴力搜索方法更高效

Conclusion: 该方法推进了基于反散模型的图像编辑框架在实际中的部署应用

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

TL;DR: RynnVLA-001是一个基于大规模视频生成预训练的视觉-语言-动作模型，采用两阶段预训练方法：第一阶段通过自我中心视频生成预测未来帧，第二阶段通过人体中心轨迹感知建模联合预测关键点轨迹，并使用ActionVAE压缩动作序列，在下游机器人任务中表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在动作表示和预测方面存在挑战，需要更有效的预训练策略来桥接视觉帧预测和动作预测，并减少VLA输出空间的复杂性。

Method: 提出两阶段预训练方法：1）自我中心视频生成预训练，在1200万自我中心操作视频上训练图像到视频模型；2）人体中心轨迹感知建模，联合预测未来关键点轨迹。还提出ActionVAE变分自编码器来压缩动作序列。

Result: 在相同下游机器人数据集上微调后，RynnVLA-001实现了优于最先进基线的性能表现。

Conclusion: 所提出的预训练策略为VLA模型提供了更有效的初始化方法，证明了视频生成预训练在视觉-语言-动作建模中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

Motivation: 评估现有公开深度学习肺部分割模型在肺穿制预备患者中的表现，确定其在不同病情严重程度、病理类型和肺侧的性能差异，以识别在肺穿制术前规划中的应用限制。

Method: 回须性研究包括32名患者的3,645张CT分割图像。使用三种深度学习模型(Unet-R231、TotalSegmentator、MedSAM)进行肺部分割，采用定量指标(体积相似性、Dice相似系数、Hausdorff距离)和四级临床可接受性评分进行性能评估。

Result: Unet-R231在所有情况下均显著优于其他两种模型(p<0.05)。所有模型在从轻度到中重度病例中性能显著下降，尤其是体积相似性指标(p<0.05)。肺侧和病理类型间无显著差异。

Conclusion: Unet-R231是评估模型中最准确的自动肺部分割模型，TotalSegmentator次之，但在中重度病情下性能显著下降，强调了在严重病理情况下进行专门模型微调的必要性。

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the

arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种仅需单个RGB视频作为监督的动态场景摄像机参数优化方法，解决了COLMAP在动态场景中运行时间长、依赖真实运动掩码等限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如COLMAP在动态场景中存在运行时间长、依赖真实运动掩码等限制，而许多改进方法需要额外的先验知识（如真实焦距、运动掩码、3D点云等），这些在普通摄像的RGB视频中通常不可用。

Method: 方法包含三个关键组件：(1)表面块跟踪筛波器，建立突出的架柱关系；(2)离群点识别的聚合优化，通过自适应降权移动离群点来优化摄像机参数；(3)两阶段优化策略，通过在损失函数中平衡Softplus限制和凸极小值来提高稳定性和优化速度。

Result: 在4个实际数据集（NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, TUM-dynamics）和1个合成数据集（MPI-Sintel）上进行实验，结果显示该方法能够更高效、更准确地估计摄像机参数，仅需单个RGB视频作为唯一监督。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态场景的摄像机参数优化提供了一种更加准确和高效的解决方案，充分利用了单个RGB视频的信息，而无需额外的先验知识或监督信息。

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗视觉语言模型在事实一致性和可靠推理方面的关键挑战，确保医学AI的可信度。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用伪标签监督微调（SFT）融入外部事实专业知识；第二阶段应用带有四个定制事实奖励信号的组相对策略优化（GRPO）来鼓励自一致推理。

Abstract: Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical
challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a
two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with
reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first
stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external
factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage
self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks,
MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over
previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of
pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward,
underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning
for trustworthy medical AI. Codes are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代深度学习模型主要依赖大规模数据集的统计规律，缺乏从感知心理学涉取的结构化见解，需要探索知觉驱动的引导偏置的潜力

Method: 创建了合成的参数化几何幻觉数据集，并评估了三种多源学习策略，将幻觉识别任务与ImageNet分类目标相结合

Result: 结果显示：(i)将几何幻觉作为辅助监督系统性地改善了普途化能力，特别是在涉及复杂轮廓和细微纹理的视觉挑战性场景中；(ii)知觉驱动的引导偏置能够提升CNN和transformer结构的结构敏感性

Conclusion: 这些结果展示了知觉科学与机器学习的新颖集成，为将知觉先验知识嵌入视觉模型设计提供了新方向

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

TL;DR: 通过改变指令提示来操控RAG系统的检索行为，实现隐藏性攻击，攻击成功率达95.23%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击主要依赖操控用户查询，而指令提示作为被广泛重用且很少审计的组件，成为更现实的攻击瞬间

Method: 使用多样化查询生成策略模拟现实语言变化，并通过遗传算法进行聚合优化，在攻击成功率、正常功能和隐藏性之间得到平衡

Result: AIP攻击能够达到95.23%的攻击成功率，同时保持良性功能的正常运行

Conclusion: 该研究曝露了RAG系统中一个重要但被忽视的漏洞，强调了重新评估共享指令提示的必要性

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

Conclusion: M&N框架有效实现了2D到3D的知识迁移，为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的半监督解决方案，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

Motivation: 亲缘关系验证中存在年龄差异问题，且同年龄照片难以获取，现有的人脸老化模型存在种族偏见，影响照片相似度判断

Method: 开发RA-GAN模型，包含RACEpSp模块和特征混合器，用于生成无种族偏见的人脸老化图像，并将这些图像用于亲缘关系验证

Result: RA-GAN在种族准确性上平均比SAM-GAN高13.14%，在60+年龄组比CUSP-GAN高9.1%，能更好地保持身份特征。在KinFaceW数据集上，亲缘关系验证准确率显著提升

Conclusion: RA-GAN有效解决了人脸老化中的种族偏见问题，生成的同年龄图像能显著提高亲缘关系验证的准确性，特别是在不同年龄组和亲缘关系类型上都有明显改善

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

TL;DR: 通过多模态大语言模型实现零样本学习的时空视频基准方法，采用解耦空间-时间立方法和时间增强组装策略，在三个STVG标准数据集上超越了最新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLM模型在时空视频基准任务中存在的两个问题：(1)动态分配基准token的偏好；(2)无法充分整合文本查询中的类型和动作等线索进行推理。

Method: 提出DSTH策略：将原始查询解耦为属性和动作子查询，使用logit引导的重关注(LRA)模块学习空间和时间提示词，高亮关键线索。TAS策略：使用原始帧和时间增强帧进行预测组装，提高时间一致性。

Result: 在三个常见STVG标准数据集上，该方法在多个MLLM模型上都超越了当前最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦查询和提示学习策略，MLLM可以在零样本场景下有效地处理时空视频基准任务，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

Motivation: 精准农业需要准确的玉米幼苗检测，但现有数据集稀缺。传统方法劳动密集且易出错，计算机视觉可实现高效准确的检测。

Method: 构建包含三类玉米植株（单株、双株、三株）的航空图像数据集MSDD，涵盖不同生长阶段、种植设置、土壤类型、光照条件、相机角度和密度，使用YOLO等目标检测模型进行基准测试。

Result: 单株检测精度达0.984，召回率0.873；双株和三株检测较困难；YOLO11推理速度最快（35ms/图像），YOLOv9单株检测精度最高；检测在V4-V6阶段和天底视角下最可靠。

Conclusion: MSDD为开发增强植株计数、优化资源分配和支持实时决策的模型奠定了坚实基础，推动了农业监测自动化和精准农业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

Conclusion: 通过自监督助学习可以有效解决自回归模型在视觉领域的问题，ST-AR框架为提高视觉表征质量提供了有效途径

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Conclusion: SyncSeal为图像水印提供了有效的同步解决方案，能够显著增强现有水印技术对几何攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件相机深度估计中数据注释缺乏的问题，通过利用VFM的稳健性和跨模态萌荐技术，为单目事件相机深度估计提供了一种经济高效的解决方案

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Method: 提出CalibPrompt框架，在提示调优过程中使用校准目标优化可学习提示：1）使用正则化器对齐平滑准确率与预测置信度；2）引入角度分离损失最大化文本特征接近度

Result: 在4个公开Med-VLMs和5个医学影像数据集上的实验表明，CalibPrompt能一致改善校准性能，且不影响原始准确率

Conclusion: CalibPrompt是首个专门针对Med-VLMs置信度校准的框架，有效解决了医学AI应用中关键的可靠性问题

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.

TL;DR: AEGIS框架通过LLM驱动的自适应操纵器自动生成多智能体系统的错误数据集，为错误识别任务提供大规模标注数据，显著提升监督学习、强化学习和对比学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统日益自主和复杂，但缺乏大规模、多样化的错误标注数据集，严重阻碍了系统可靠性和安全性研究。

Method: 使用基于LLM的上下文感知自适应操纵器，通过可控可追踪的错误注入（如提示注入和响应破坏）来生成真实的失败轨迹数据集。

Result: 在三种学习范式（监督微调、强化学习、对比学习）上都取得了显著改进，多个微调模型的性能达到或超过大一个数量级的专有系统。

Conclusion: AEGIS自动化数据生成框架是开发更鲁棒和可解释多智能体系统的关键资源，验证了自动化错误生成方法的有效性。

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过引入物理可解释的能量流场（风险势场和车道吸引场）来编码语义先验和安全提示，提升运动规划的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架依赖隐式学习的BEV特征，缺乏对风险和引导先验的显式建模，无法实现安全和可解释的规划。

Method: 提出FlowDrive框架：1）引入物理可解释的能量流场（风险势场和车道吸引场）编码语义先验；2）使用条件扩散规划器解耦运动意图预测和轨迹去噪；3）通过特征级门控增强多模态多样性。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2基准测试中达到86.3的EPDMS分数，在安全性和规划质量方面均超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过显式建模风险势场和车道吸引场，为自动驾驶运动规划提供了物理可解释的安全引导机制，同时通过条件扩散规划器有效解耦任务并增强多模态能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is
available at https://astrixdrive.github.io/FlowDrive.github.io/.

TL;DR: 多机器人通过纯接触力协调运输不可抓取物体，使用分层策略架构和星座奖励设计，无需通信或集中控制即可实现去中心化协作运输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机械独立的机器人仅通过接触力进行协调的挑战性场景，避免依赖刚性机械耦合或通信，实现真正的去中心化协作运输。

Method: 采用分层策略架构分离基座移动和手臂控制，提出星座奖励公式统一位置和方向跟踪，通过精心设计的奖励和训练课程让机器人表现得像刚性连接。

Result: 在2-10个机器人规模上展示了跨不同物体几何形状和质量的鲁棒运输性能，并实现了轻量级物体的仿真到现实迁移。

Conclusion: 通过共享策略参数和隐式同步线索，该方法能够扩展到任意团队规模而无需重新训练，为去中心化协作运输提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and
intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot

Motivation: 解决人形机器人同时控制上下半身并与物体交互的复杂任务，通过人类运动数据指导RL策略，发现直接RL无法获得的解决方案

Method: 使用人类运动数据训练扩散先验模型，然后在仿真中用该先验指导强化学习策略完成特定任务

Result: 该方法能够完成开抽屉、拾取物体等挑战性任务，产生的运动更加自然，有助于仿真到现实的迁移

Conclusion: DreamControl通过扩散先验和RL的结合，为人形机器人学习复杂全身技能提供了有效方法，在Unitree G1机器人上验证了其有效性

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous
whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion
models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower
and upper body control and object interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习在机器人应用中面临高维连续动作空间、复杂奖励设计和非平稳环境等挑战，而人类通过分阶段课程学习复杂协调行为，这启发了利用基础模型作为教练的思路

Method: 使用大型语言模型(LLM)自动分解长时程协调任务为子任务序列，用LLM生成每个子任务的奖励函数，并通过视觉语言模型(VLM)指导的奖励优化循环进行精炼

Result: 在四足机器人导航和双手操作任务上成功学习了复杂协调行为，并在真实硬件实验中验证了四足机器人导航策略的有效性

Conclusion: CRAFT框架通过利用基础模型的推理能力，能够有效解决多机器人协调中的复杂挑战，为MARL在机器人领域的应用提供了新思路

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

### [75] [RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14383)
*Yuhong Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RLBind是一个两阶段对抗不变性跨模态对齐框架，通过无监督微调和跨模态对齐来增强统一多模态编码器的鲁棒性，在保持泛化能力的同时显著提升对抗攻击和自然损坏的抵抗能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人部署中视觉分支面临对抗性和自然损坏，现有防御方法通常只在CLIP风格编码器内对齐干净和对抗特征，忽略了更广泛的跨模态对应关系，导致增益有限且可能损害零样本迁移能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段对干净-对抗对进行无监督微调以强化视觉编码器；第二阶段利用跨模态对应关系，最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异，同时强制跨模态的类级分布对齐。

Result: 在图像、音频、热成像和视频数据上的广泛实验表明，RLBind在干净准确率和有界范数对抗鲁棒性方面始终优于LanguageBind主干和标准微调基线。

Conclusion: RLBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高了鲁棒性，为具身机器人在导航、操作和其他自主场景中提供了更安全的多传感器感知堆栈的实用路径。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GestOS是一个基于手势的操作系统，通过语义理解和LLM推理实现多机器人团队的智能任务分配与控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手势控制系统通常将手势映射为固定命令或单机器人动作，缺乏对多机器人团队的语义理解和动态任务分配能力

Method: 结合轻量级视觉感知和大型语言模型：将手势姿态转换为结构化文本描述，LLM推断意图并生成机器人特定命令，实时匹配最适合的机器人执行任务

Result: 实现了上下文感知的自适应控制，无需用户明确指定目标或命令，支持在动态环境中进行可扩展、灵活的用户友好协作

Conclusion: GestOS将手势交互从简单识别推进到智能编排，为异构机器人团队提供了语义化、动态分布式的控制解决方案

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于3D高斯泼溅的碰撞锥安全滤波器，通过解析几何方法构建一阶控制屏障函数，实现主动避障和实时导航


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于距离的CBF方法反应滞后，只在障碍物接近时才激活，需要更高计算成本且轨迹不够平滑。需要一种更主动、计算高效的安全避障方法

Method: 将每个3D高斯泼溅转换为闭式前向碰撞锥，构建一阶控制屏障函数并嵌入二次规划问题。利用解析几何特性提供连续闭式碰撞约束表示

Result: 在包含约17万个泼溅的大型合成场景中，规划时间减少3倍，轨迹抖动显著降低，同时保持相同安全水平

Conclusion: 该方法完全解析，无需高阶CBF扩展，通过Minkowski和膨胀自然推广到有物理尺寸的机器人，适用于实时导航和极端环境应用

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习在竞争性场景中的三大挑战：同时适应导致训练不稳定、非动能对抗措施在恶劣条件下失效、以及策略在不同智能体数量环境中的泛化能力差。

Method: 提出Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO)框架，集成图神经网络捕捉置换等变性，通过规范化实现E(n)-等变性，使用异构表示编码角色特定的归纳偏置，并与MAPPO等流行MARL算法无缝集成。

Result: 在合作和竞争性群体基准测试中，LEGO优于强基线并提高了泛化能力。在真实世界实验中，LEGO展现出对不同团队规模和智能体故障的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LEGO框架有效解决了多智能体强化学习的关键挑战，提供了更好的训练稳定性、鲁棒性和泛化性能，适用于复杂决策场景中的智能体协调。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

TL;DR: 本文研究在间歇性监控环境下，智能体如何通过心理理论(Theory of Mind)实现欺骗性行为，在追求私利的同时保持对监管者参考策略的表面合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中自主系统的监控往往是间歇性的，智能体可以在不被观测时追求私人目标，但需要在被观测时显得合规。受人类监管者行为的启发，需要一种能够理解监管者期望并相应调整行为的智能系统。

Method: 利用心理理论建模监管者的期望，从中提取一个标量指标——预期偏差证据，该指标结合了参考策略与当前策略分布的差异程度以及观测即将发生的概率。将该标量作为状态依赖权重注入KL正则化的策略改进步骤中，实现在线强化学习。

Result: 在海洋(ASV)和空中(UAV)导航的真实硬件实验中，ToM引导的RL算法能够在线运行，实现高回报和成功率，同时观测轨迹证据与监管者期望保持校准。

Conclusion: 心理理论可以有效地重新用于指导在线强化学习产生欺骗性行为，通过单一校准标量平滑地权衡自利与合规，避免了手工或启发式策略的设计。

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从视觉数据自动发现离散图结构抽象的方法，用于机器人重排任务规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地在抽象层面进行推理，而机器人中的抽象通常是手工设计的，限制了可扩展性。从视觉数据自动发现有用抽象可以使规划框架更具可扩展性和适用性

Method: 结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离来诱导离散图结构抽象，利用重排问题的固有二分结构，将结构约束和视觉嵌入整合到统一框架中

Result: 在模拟环境中的两个重排任务上评估，方法始终能够识别出有意义的抽象，促进有效规划，并优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅从视觉数据自主发现抽象，支持高层规划，为机器人领域提供了更可扩展的抽象发现解决方案

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

Conclusion: 机器学习是从触觉图像中提取信息的有效技术，能够赋能软体机器人更好地理解和与环境交互，为软体机器人的智能感知提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

Method: 使用Pixi包和依赖管理器实现Event-LAB框架，支持单命令行安装和调用，实现了视觉位置识别(VPR)和同步定位与建图(SLAM)两种常见管道。

Result: 框架能够系统可视化分析多种方法和数据集的结果，揭示了事件收集计数和帧生成窗口大小等参数对性能的显著影响。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis
demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent
event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this
ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for
easily setting up multiple conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草莓自然生长在聚集的群落中，常被叶子和枝条没蒙，给传统机器人摘采系统带来巨大挑战，需要灵活的操控来突破没蒙障碍

Method: 采用4-DoF SCARA机械臂搭配人类远程操纵界面进行数据收集，利用终点位置辅助的动作块化Transformer(ACT)学习精细的视觉运动摘采策略

Result: 在各种没蒙场景下的实验表明，该改进方法显著超过直接实施ACT方法，显示了在实际没蒙草莓摘采中的应用潜力

Conclusion: 通过人类社会学习和终点位置辅助的方法，成功开发了能够有效处理没蒙草莓摘采问题的机器人系统，为农业自动化摘采提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂实验室自动化中的操作难题，具有实际应用价值，显著提升了振动筛自动化操作的效率和可靠性

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly

Conclusion: 通过系统集成和层次优化策略，成功开发了能够自动解体约束结构的重构化机器人系统，为复杂工作环境提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

Conclusion: 通过等变性理论指导的动作空间设计，可以有效解决跨具身预训练的构型泛化问题，提升策略对新机器人配置的适应能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BEV-ODOM2是一个改进的单目视觉里程计框架，通过密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合来解决现有BEV方法监督信号稀疏和信息丢失的问题，在多个数据集上实现了40%的相对平移误差改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的BEV方法存在监督信号稀疏和透视到BEV投影过程中的信息丢失问题，需要在不增加额外标注的情况下解决这些限制。

Method: 提出密集BEV光流监督（从3-DoF位姿真值构建）和PV-BEV融合（在投影前计算相关体积以保持6-DoF运动线索），采用三级监督机制和增强的旋转采样策略。

Result: 在KITTI、NCLT、Oxford和新收集的ZJH-VO多尺度数据集上实现了最先进的性能，相对平移误差比之前的BEV方法提高了40%。

Conclusion: BEV-ODOM2有效解决了BEV方法的监督稀疏和信息丢失问题，显著提升了单目视觉里程计的性能，并发布了涵盖多样化场景的ZJH-VO数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to
facilitate future research.

Motivation: 密集3D卷积虽然准确但计算成本高，现有三平面方法依赖隐式MLP和点查询，计算重。需要一种更高效的方法来支持嵌入式机器人系统的实时感知。

Method: 提出无插值三平面提取和体积融合框架，直接将3D像素投影到平面特征，通过广播和求和重建特征体积。添加低分辨率体积分支获取全局上下文，通过轻量融合层结合。

Result: 分类和补全任务保持或提高了准确性，分割和检测任务在准确性上有轻微下降但获得了显著的计算节省。在NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano上实现了稳健的实时速率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提高计算效率而保持高准确性，适合嵌入式机器人系统的实时3D感知应用。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between
simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose
RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Motivation: 重新研究Karl Wohlhart提出的三环空间连杆机构，该机构在参考配置下显示出有限自由度与微分自由度的明显差异，需要深入分析其配置空间特性。

Method: 通过局部分析方法，计算运动学切向镜和配置空间的局部近似，并进行高阶局部分析来研究连杆的自由度特性。

Result: 发现该连杆机构具有有限自由度3度（过约束），但在参考配置下微分自由度为5度，配置空间局部为光滑流形，微分自由度局部恒定，使其成为摇动连杆。

Conclusion: 该三环空间连杆在参考配置下不是配置空间奇异点，其微分自由度局部恒定的特性证明该机构为摇动连杆，为连杆机构学提供了重要的理论参考。

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Motivation: 传统基于模型的控制器依赖预计算参考轨迹，性能受限。RL研究表明许多控制器优化的是替代目标（如轨迹跟踪）而非直接最大化通过门的进度。

Method: 将门进度目标整合到MPPI框架中，利用MPPI的采样特性优化不连续、不可微的目标函数。建立了统一框架比较轨迹跟踪、轮廓控制和门进度三种目标函数。

Result: 提出的无参考方法实现了有竞争力的竞速性能，媲美甚至超过基于参考的方法。

Conclusion: MPPI能够有效优化不连续的目标函数，无参考方法在无人机竞速中具有优势，为时间最优控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人机共享工作空间中，有效沟通对安全和效率至关重要。本文研究非语言沟通对人机交互的影响，特别是通过光信号和情感显示来传达运动意图。

Method: 使用Franka Emika Panda机器人，在其末端执行器上安装LED灯带，并通过平板显示动态面部表情。进行了18名参与者的人机协作实验，评估三种条件：LED信号单独、LED信号+反应式情感显示、LED信号+预阻式情感显示。通过问卷和位置跟踪收集数据。

Result: 结果显示，虽然情感显示增加了机器人的互动性感知，但与单独使用LED信号相比，并没有显著改善碰撞预期、沟通清晰度或任务效率。

Conclusion: 情感细节虽然可以增强用户参与感，但在共享工作空间的任务性能方面影响有限。LED信号已经能够提供有效的沟通方式。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical

Motivation: 受限杂乱环境中的操作面临部分可观测性和复杂配置空间的挑战，需要智能探索策略来安全理解场景和搜索目标。

Method: 提出多阶段探索操作框架，包括近场感知扫描构建局部碰撞地图、多目标效用函数选择信息丰富且利于操作的视点、约束操作优化策略生成避障操作位姿。

Result: 在仿真中相比仅考虑信息增益的探索方法，操作成功率提高24.25%；真实世界实验验证了在受限环境中主动感知和操作的能力。

Conclusion: COMPASS框架有效解决了受限杂乱环境中的操作挑战，通过系统化的探索和优化策略显著提升了操作性能。

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

TL;DR: GCR-PPO是一种改进的强化学习算法，通过多目标梯度冲突解决机制提升机器人控制性能，在冲突任务中表现优于传统PPO方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习将多任务目标聚合为单一标量奖励，存在奖励调优困难、易陷入局部最优的问题，且目标数量增加时调优成本和次优性增长，限制了可扩展性

Method: 提出GCR-PPO算法，使用多头critic分解actor更新为目标梯度，基于目标优先级解决梯度冲突，特别处理任务奖励与策略正则化项之间的冲突

Result: 在IsaacLab操纵和运动基准测试中，相比并行PPO具有更好的可扩展性(p=0.04)，平均性能提升9.5%，高冲突任务提升更明显，且无显著计算开销

Conclusion: GCR-PPO通过显式处理多目标梯度冲突，有效解决了传统强化学习在多目标优化中的局限性，为机器人控制提供了更可扩展和鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言-动作框架的局限性，包括领域过拟合、推理不可解释性以及辅助生成模型的高延迟问题，使VLA从黑盒控制器转变为真正能与人类协作的辅助智能体

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：动作接地和反思调优，整合VLM基于的反思推理和扩散基于的动作生成，在混合专家设计下支持显式自我反思并在遇到不确定性或重复失败时主动寻求人类指导

Result: 与生成智能体相比，标准化时间减少约2倍，Dream计数减少约4倍，实现了更高的成功率、改进的可解释性以及与现有方法相比平衡的低延迟

Conclusion: 这项工作在将VLA从黑盒控制器转变为真正能够推理、行动并与人类协作的辅助智能体方面迈出了开创性的一步

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

TL;DR: PERAL是一个用于球形机器人的感知感知运动控制框架，通过内部差速驱动实现被动LiDAR激励，无需额外硬件即可增强垂直扫描多样性，提高地图完整性和导航精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水平安装LiDAR（如MID360）在近地面捕获点云稀少的问题，传统方法如静态倾斜、主动旋转或高密度传感器要么牺牲水平感知，要么增加成本、功耗和执行器

Method: 通过建模内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合关系，在名义目标跟踪命令上叠加有界非周期性振荡，实现被动LiDAR激励

Result: 在实验室、走廊和战术环境中验证，实现高达96%的地图完整性，轨迹跟踪误差减少27%，并能稳健检测近地面人体，相比基线方法重量、功耗和成本更低

Conclusion: PERAL框架为球形机器人提供了一种无需专用硬件的有效LiDAR激励解决方案，显著提升了在特征稀缺环境中的感知性能

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RCS成功填补了机器人学习研究中软件基础设施的空白，为大规模通用策略的研究提供了高效、统一的开发环境，促进了从仿真到真实环境的顺利过渡。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of
anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.

TL;DR: ExT是一个用于自主挖掘机的统一开源框架，通过大规模演示收集、预训练和微调来开发多任务挖掘策略，实现了从仿真到真实机器的成功迁移和快速适应新任务的能力。

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧耦合的语义-LiDAR-惯性-轮式里程计融合框架，用于大规模动态环境中的高精度状态估计和鲁棒定位，通过语义体素地图和改进的扫描匹配算法显著减少长期轨迹漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模动态环境中可靠、无漂移的全局定位这一关键挑战，这对于自动驾驶导航至关重要。

Method: 使用紧耦合多传感器融合迭代误差状态卡尔曼滤波器(iESKF)融合LiDAR、IMU和轮式里程计数据，采用高效的语义体素地图表示和改进的扫描匹配算法，并引入3D自适应缩放策略来调整轮式里程计测量权重。

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效模型复杂任务关系，通过动态重分配提高系统性能，为多机器人协同作业提供了高效的任务分配解决方案

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

Motivation: 当前基于VLA的具身代理大多采用单向模式，接收指令后直接执行而不寻求反馈，这在指令模糊的真实场景中会失败。需要创建能够与人类交互协作而非被动执行指令的具身代理

Method: Ask-to-Clarify框架包含两个组件：用于协作的VLM和用于动作的扩散模型，通过连接模块生成扩散条件。采用两阶段知识隔离训练策略，先微调协作组件处理模糊性，再集成动作组件

Result: 在8个真实世界任务评估中，该框架优于现有最先进的VLA方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架和训练策略为实现协作式具身代理提供了一条可行路径

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来行星探测户外车需要在核电源和太阳能混合助力下长时间运行，而现有的轨迹规划方法通常忽视了能量可行性和瞬时功率约束

Method: 将物理基础的平移、旋转和阻力功耗模型与基准子系统负载相结合，并将累计能量预算和瞬时功率约束集成到SE(2)基于多项式的轨迹优化中

Result: 在月球类似地形上的模拟显示，该规划器生成的轨迹峰值功率仅超过规定限制0.55%，而现有方法超过17%以上

Conclusion: 该方法为长时间行星任务提供了一种理论坚实且实用的能量意识自主规划方案

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的力工具使用任务产生的传感器数据具有噪声大、非平稳且任务间差异大的特点，现有多变量时间序列异常检测方法难以直接应用。

Method: 基于扩散模型提取力-扭矩特征，使用力-扭矩特征进行异常检测，并提出基于一步扩散的并行异常评分评估方法。

Result: 在四个力工具使用任务上，AnoF-Diff在F1分数和AUROC指标上优于其他最先进方法，对噪声数据集更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AnoF-Diff方法能有效处理力工具使用任务中的噪声时间序列数据，实现了更好的异常检测性能，并支持在线应用。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Conclusion: 所提出的统一建模框架能够有效优化软生长机器人的设计，使其能够利用环境接触在复杂障碍物环境中成功部署

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注解决已有问题，本文旨在探索LLMs发现新定理的能力，实现自动化的数学猜想生成和证明

Method: 采用猜想-证明循环管道，在包含先前生成定理及其证明的上下文中生成新猜想并证明，通过上下文学习提升证明能力而不改变模型参数

Result: 成功重新发现了过去数学论文中发表但尚未形式化的定理，其中至少一个定理在没有上下文学习的情况下无法证明（即使在自然语言中）

Conclusion: 上下文学习对神经定理证明有效，该框架能够自动生成和证明数学定理，展示了LLMs在数学发现方面的潜力

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem
proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In
this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose
Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical
conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is
that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including
previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of
more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without
changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered
theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers
and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not
be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language,
which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

Motivation: 探索深度神经网络在科学计算中的应用效果，为实践者提供经验指南，并揭示标准网络架构在处理切变问题时的基本限制。

Method: 通过系统实验测试不同网络配置参数（激活函数、网络深度、宽度、训练方法）对深度神经网络近似非局部守恒律解方的影响，并与传统数值方法进行对比分析。

Result: tanh激活函数在各种配置下都能稳定收敛，正弦激活在某些情况下可以获得更低错误和更短训练时间，但有时会产生非物理效果。优化配置的DNN能够获得竞争力的精度，但标准前缀网络在处理奇异或切变解时会过度平滑错误。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经网络科学计算提供了实践指南，同时揭示了标准激活函数的函数空间限制导致的基本约束，指出需要克服这些限制才能扩大神经网络在处理含间断性的更复杂物理系统中的应用范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the
identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an
architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy
norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate
that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function
selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width
(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch
count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that
tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine
activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated
cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis
with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer
competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.
Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward
architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing
empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due
to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.
This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based
scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for
DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that
must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical
systems with discontinuities.

Motivation: 探索神经网络在仅使用二元正确/错误监督信号时能否同时学习好的检查和丰富的信心估计

Method: 通过严格的数学分析和完整的实验评估，涉及负奖励训练、对称损失函数和后处理检查方法

Result: 实验显示普遍失败模式：负奖励导致极端不自信，对称损失无法逆转二元信号平均，后处理方法只能通过压缩信心分布来实现检查

Conclusion: 这种不可能性直接解释了神经网络的幻觉现象，并证明了后处理检查的数学必要性，建议采用集成分歧和适应性多代理学习来充超这些基本限制

Abstract: We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: neural networks cannot
simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful
diversity when trained using binary correct/incorrect supervision. Through
rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning
negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration
methods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a
methodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:
negative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while
destroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to
escape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE
less than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize
this as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot
distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60
percent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent
confident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure
rate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while
post-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our
theorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.
This impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and
establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely
convenient. We propose novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement
and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental
limitations without requiring human confidence annotations.

Motivation: 扩展LLM上下文窗口对长序列任务至关重要，但RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合会导致精度显著下降，需要系统分析和解决方案

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组到频率带，对W_Q和W_K进行每带尺度的小范围搜索，使用插值压力和尾部膨胀比率作为诊断指标

Result: Q-ROAR在标准任务上恢复0.7%的准确率，将GovReport困惑度降低10%以上，同时保持短上下文性能和现有推理栈兼容性

Conclusion: 该方法无需微调、内核或架构更改，通过频率带感知的权重稳定化有效解决了PI+PTQ的精度退化问题

Abstract: Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based
position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling
extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ)
enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades
accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation,
axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit
noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce
two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity)
and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To
address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that
groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search
over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to
preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context
dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes.
Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces
GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context
performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

Abstract: Information retrieval with compact binary embeddings, also referred to as

hashing methods require expensive, scenario-specific training. In this work, we
introduce Hashing-Baseline, a strong training-free hashing method leveraging
powerful pretrained encoders that produce rich pretrained embeddings. We
revisit classical, training-free hashing techniques: principal component
analysis, random orthogonal projection, and threshold binarization, to produce
a strong baseline for hashing. Our approach combines these techniques with
frozen embeddings from state-of-the-art vision and audio encoders to yield
competitive retrieval performance without any additional learning or
fine-tuning. To demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach,
we evaluate it on standard image retrieval benchmarks as well as a newly
introduced benchmark for audio hashing.

Result: 在非光滑凸联邦学习设置下实现标准O(1/√T)收敛率，且与每轮参与用户数无关；实验显示在异构性、公平敏感性和低可用性场景下相比FedAvg性能大幅提升

Conclusion: FedAVOT通过最优传输有效解决了联邦学习中的分布不对齐问题，即使在极低参与度情况下也能保持稳定和高效的性能

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training without sharing raw
data, but suffers when client participation is partial. In practice, the
distribution of available users (\emph{availability distribution} $q$) rarely
aligns with the distribution defining the optimization objective
(\emph{importance distribution} $p$), leading to biased and unstable updates
under classical FedAvg. We propose \textbf{Fereated AVerage with Optimal
Transport (\textbf{FedAVOT})}, which formulates aggregation as a masked optimal
transport problem aligning $q$ and $p$. Using Sinkhorn scaling,
\textbf{FedAVOT} computes transport-based aggregation weights with provable
convergence guarantees. \textbf{FedAVOT} achieves a standard
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under a nonsmooth convex FL setting, independent
of the number of participating users per round. Our experiments confirm
drastically improved performance compared to FedAvg across heterogeneous,
fairness-sensitive, and low-availability regimes, even when only two clients
participate per round.

Motivation: 天文观测数据量巨大，需要高效处理算法来确保输入机器学习模型的数据质量。GONG网络的Hα观测数据流产生频率高，需要可靠的异常检测方法。

Method: 设计了一种轻量级非机器学习异常检测算法，基于用户定义标准识别异常观测，明确指出触发异常标记的区域并量化异常概率。

Result: 算法在2,000个观测数据集上表现优异，超过现有方法，同时提供了可解释性，便于领域专家进行定性评估。

Conclusion: H-Alpha Anomalyzer算法为天文数据异常检测提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案，适用于大规模数据流的质量控制。

Abstract: The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided
astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be
processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring
the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The
H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream,
producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we
introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha
Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined
criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly
which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding
anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released
a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and
non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only
outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling
qualitative evaluation by domain experts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 随机化局部协调优化方法，通过每次迭代随机选择一个正则项进行局部协调，大幅降低通信开销保持收敛性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式优化中全局同步通信成本高的问题，特别是当正则项数量m较大时，标准方法需要每迭代O(m)次通信

Method: 每个节点独立均匀采样一个正则项，只与共享该项的节点进行协调，用单个随机选择正则项的近端映射替换全局正则项和的近端映射

Result: 对于图导向正则项(|S_j|=2)，期望通信量降低到2消息/迭代；凸优化目标达到偏微式收敛率，强凸情况下达到线性和对数收敛率

Conclusion: 随机化局部协调方法在保持收敛性的同时显著降低了通信成本，通过利用正则项的部分可分离性避免了全局协调的需求

Abstract: Distributed optimization requires nodes to coordinate, yet full
synchronization scales poorly. When $n$ nodes collaborate through $m$ pairwise
regularizers, standard methods demand $\mathcal{O}(m)$ communications per
iteration. This paper proposes randomized local coordination: each node
independently samples one regularizer uniformly and coordinates only with nodes
sharing that term. This exploits partial separability, where each regularizer
$G_j$ depends on a subset $S_j \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of nodes. For
graph-guided regularizers where $|S_j|=2$, expected communication drops to
exactly 2 messages per iteration. This method achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations for convex objectives and
under strong convexity, $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to an
$\varepsilon$-solution and $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to a
neighborhood. Replacing the proximal map of the sum $\sum_j G_j$ with the
proximal map of a single randomly selected regularizer $G_j$ preserves
convergence while eliminating global coordination. Experiments validate both
convergence rates and communication efficiency across synthetic and real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件日益复杂和广泛传播，传统静态分析方法难以应对代码混淆、多态性等规避技术，需要更有效的实时检测方法。行为检测通过监控运行时活动提供更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出BEACON框架：利用大语言模型从原始沙箱行为报告生成密集的上下文嵌入，捕获样本的语义和结构模式，然后使用一维卷积神经网络进行多类别恶意软件分类。

Result: 在Avast-CTU Public CAPE数据集上的评估显示，该框架持续优于现有方法，证明了基于LLM的行为嵌入和BEACON整体设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的行为嵌入和BEACON框架为稳健的恶意软件分类提供了有效的解决方案，在复杂恶意软件检测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential
to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static
analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code
obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast,
behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a
more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior
reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each
sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D
CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public
CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the
overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上评估，多模型方法在案例后缀预测中显示出优势

Conclusion: 该技术能够提供更全面的时间预测信息，有助于改善资源容量规划的决策支持

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision
making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A
subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an
ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix
prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the
end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,
where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy
performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes
consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the
proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of
each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how
busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,
wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in
lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An
evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of
different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.

Motivation: 当前的Muon优化器及其变体在训练大模型时存在样本复杂度高或内存占用大的问题，而一些AI任务如训练大语言模型并不满足传统收敛分析所需的严格柯西利平滑假设。

Method: 基于动量基方差缩减技术和随机奇异值分解(SVD)，设计了轻量级的LiMuon优化器。

Result: LiMuon优化器比当前Muon及其变体内存占用更低，在非凸随机优化下达到O(ε^{-3})的样本复杂度，并在广义平滑条件下保持同样的收敛性能。在DistilGPT2和ViT模型训练中验证了其效率。

Conclusion: LiMuon优化器为大模型训练提供了一种内存效率高、样本复杂度低的解决方案，并能够在更广泛的平滑性条件下保持良好的收敛性能。

Abstract: Large models recently are widely applied in artificial intelligence, so
efficient training of large models has received widespread attention. More
recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for
matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to
studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from
high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we
propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models,
which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory
than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has
a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the
smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer
mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial
intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy
this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition.
Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify
efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.

Conclusion: A²SL框架虽然以淡水生态系统为案例，但为各科学领域提供了广泛适用的解决方案

Abstract: The discovery of environmental knowledge depends on labeled task-specific
data, but is often constrained by the high cost of data collection. Existing
machine learning approaches usually struggle to generalize in data-sparse or
atypical conditions. To this end, we propose an Augmentation-Adaptive
Self-Supervised Learning (A$^2$SL) framework, which retrieves relevant
observational samples to enhance modeling of the target ecosystem.
Specifically, we introduce a multi-level pairwise learning loss to train a
scenario encoder that captures varying degrees of similarity among scenarios.
These learned similarities drive a retrieval mechanism that supplements a
target scenario with relevant data from different locations or time periods.
Furthermore, to better handle variable scenarios, particularly under atypical
or extreme conditions where traditional models struggle, we design an
augmentation-adaptive mechanism that selectively enhances these scenarios
through targeted data augmentation. Using freshwater ecosystems as a case
study, we evaluate A$^2$SL in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen
dynamics in real-world lakes. Experimental results show that A$^2$SL
significantly improves predictive accuracy and enhances robustness in
data-scarce and atypical scenarios. Although this study focuses on freshwater
ecosystems, the A$^2$SL framework offers a broadly applicable solution in
various scientific domains.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的LMDM方法仅限于向量化输入，处理高维张量数据时需要展平操作，这会破坏数据的多模态结构并增加计算负担

Method: 结合一阶和二阶张量统计量（边缘均值和方差）到目标函数中，利用低秩张量分解技术（包括rank-1 CP、高阶CP和Tucker分解）参数化权重张量，开发交替优化算法

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SPMD-LRT相比传统SVM、基于向量的LMDM以及先前的张量SVM扩展方法获得了更优的分类准确率，特别是Tucker分解的SPMD-LRT效果最好

Conclusion: SPMD-LRT在保持高维张量数据结构的同时优化边缘分布，有效提升了分类性能，证实了该方法在处理高维张量数据分类任务中的有效性和鲁棒性

Abstract: The Large Margin Distribution Machine (LMDM) is a recent advancement in
classifier design that optimizes not just the minimum margin (as in SVM) but
the entire margin distribution, thereby improving generalization. However,
existing LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with
high-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the
data's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In
this paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for
High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates
directly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT
preserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and
second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,
and it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),
higher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An
alternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to
efficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core
tensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information
of high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved
classification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,
images and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior
classification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and
prior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker
Machines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest
accuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling
high-dimensional tensor data for classification.

Motivation: 扩展离线训练的GMM-QFs到在线设置，利用流式数据促进探索，同时通过结构化稀疏化方法解决深度强化学习中模型复杂度和泛化能力的问题。

Method: 使用稀疏高斯混合模型Q函数，通过Hadamard过参数化实现模型稀疏化，在黎曼流形结构上进行在线梯度下降优化。

Result: 在标准基准测试中匹配密集深度RL方法的性能，但使用显著更少的参数，在低参数数量情况下仍保持强泛化性能，而稀疏化深度RL方法在此情况下泛化失败。

Conclusion: S-GMM-QFs提供了一个结构化、可解释且高效的在线强化学习框架，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量，特别适合资源受限的环境。

Abstract: This paper introduces a structured and interpretable online policy-iteration
framework for reinforcement learning (RL), built around the novel class of
sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions (S-GMM-QFs). Extending earlier work
that trained GMM-QFs offline, the proposed framework develops an online scheme
that leverages streaming data to encourage exploration. Model complexity is
regulated through sparsification by Hadamard overparametrization, which
mitigates overfitting while preserving expressiveness. The parameter space of
S-GMM-QFs is naturally endowed with a Riemannian manifold structure, allowing
for principled parameter updates via online gradient descent on a smooth
objective. Numerical tests show that S-GMM-QFs match the performance of dense
deep RL (DeepRL) methods on standard benchmarks while using significantly fewer
parameters, and maintain strong performance even in low-parameter-count regimes
where sparsified DeepRL methods fail to generalize.

Motivation: 传统力匹配方法在粗粒化机器学习模型中往往无法完整捕捉热力学景观，因为梯度拟合可能无法准确拟合低能构象态之间的绝对差异。

Method: 在损失函数中引入互补的能量匹配项，使用CGSchNet模型在Chignolin蛋白上进行评估，系统性地改变能量损失项的权重。

Result: 能量匹配并未产生统计上显著的精度改进，但揭示了模型在泛化自由能面时的不同趋势。

Conclusion: 未来有机会通过改进能量估计技术和多模态损失公式来增强粗粒化建模。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insight into
biomolecular systems but are often limited by high computational costs required
to access long timescales. Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a
promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching
approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a
model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy
conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy
matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the
Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight
of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically
significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how
models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future
opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy
estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.

Motivation: 分割联邦学习虽然减少了客户端计算负担，但中间激活值和模型更新的交换带来了严重的数据重建攻击隐私风险，现有噪声注入方法会降低模型性能。

Method: 提出PM-SFL框架：1）使用概率掩码训练添加结构化随机性；2）个性化掩码学习适应数据异构性；3）层间知识补偿机制处理系统异构性；4）自适应模型分割。

Result: 理论分析证实隐私保护能力，在图像和无线感知任务上的实验显示PM-SFL在准确性、通信效率和隐私攻击鲁棒性方面均有提升，在数据和系统异构环境下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: PM-SFL通过创新的概率掩码和个性化学习机制，有效解决了分割联邦学习中的隐私风险和异构性问题，实现了隐私保护与模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to
traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through
model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model
updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data
reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate
representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model
performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and
privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training
to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates
data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data
heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel
structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce
a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying
resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting.
Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image
and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves
accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with
particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.

Abstract: Energy-efficient medical data classification is essential for modern disease
screening, particularly in home and field healthcare where embedded devices are
prevalent. While deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their
substantial energy consumption and reliance on GPUs limit deployment on such
platforms. We present Hyperdimensional Computing with Class-Wise Clustering

them into multiple cluster-specific prototypes, and performs classification
through similarity search in hyperspace. We evaluate HD3C across three medical
classification tasks; on heart sound classification, HD3C is $350\times$ more
energy-efficient than Bayesian ResNet with less than 1% accuracy difference.
Moreover, HD3C demonstrates exceptional robustness to noise, limited training
data, and hardware error, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical
results, highlighting its potential for reliable deployment in real-world
settings. Code is available at https://github.com/jianglanwei/HD3C.

Conclusion: 课程遗忘概念具有重要的研究潜力，为机器遗忘领域的发展提供了前瞻性见解，CUFG框架在稳定性和效果方面表现出色。

Abstract: As privacy and security take center stage in AI, machine unlearning, the
ability to erase specific knowledge from models, has garnered increasing
attention. However, existing methods overly prioritize efficiency and
aggressive forgetting, which introduces notable limitations. In particular,
radical interventions like gradient ascent, influence functions, and random
label noise can destabilize model weights, leading to collapse and reduced
reliability. To address this, we propose CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via
Forgetting Gradients), a novel framework that enhances the stability of
approximate unlearning through innovations in both forgetting mechanisms and
data scheduling strategies. Specifically, CUFG integrates a new gradient
corrector guided by forgetting gradients for fine-tuning-based unlearning and a
curriculum unlearning paradigm that progressively forgets from easy to hard.
These innovations narrow the gap with the gold-standard Retrain method by
enabling more stable and progressive unlearning, thereby improving both
effectiveness and reliability. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of
curriculum unlearning has substantial research potential and offers
forward-looking insights for the development of the MU field. Extensive
experiments across various forgetting scenarios validate the rationale and
effectiveness of our approach and CUFG. Codes are available at

Conclusion: DeCoP框架有效解决了时间序列预训练中的动态依赖建模问题，在性能和计算效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series
pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns.
This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained
models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex
interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to
spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these
limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework
that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving
inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise
Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving
the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for

### [138] [Stochastic Clock Attention for Aligning Continuous and Ordered Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14678)
*Hyungjoon Soh,Junghyo Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过学习非负钟表模型建立了一种新的注意力机制，它能够自动产生连续、单调的对齐，无需外部位置正则化器，在保持或提高准确性的同时增强对齐的稳定性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的缩放点积注意力机制依赖位置编码和面具，但不能确保连续性或单调性，而这些对于帧同步目标至关重要。

Method: 提出使用学习的非负钟表来模型注意力，将关注度形容为这些钟表相遇的概率。通过路径积分求导得到了一个闭式的、高斯类似的评分规则，具有向因果性、平滑、近对角线对齐的内在偏向。

Result: 在Transformer文本到语音测试环境中，该方法产生了更稳定的对齐关系，提高了对全局时间缩放的鲁棒性，同时保持或提高了与缩放点积基线相比的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架支持并行解码和自回归解码两种模式，是一种几乎无参数的即插即用替换方案，预计可应用于视频和时间信号建模等其他连续目标任务。

Abstract: We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that
explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many
sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on
positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity,
which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative
\emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting
probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form,
Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth,
near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The
framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel
decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for
autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In
a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable
alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or
improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize
applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal
modeling.

TL;DR: DSCL框架通过奖励动态采样和任务动态课程学习，解决RL在工具学习中简单样本过多的问题，显著提升训练效率和模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态采样技术不适合工具学习的多任务结构和细粒度奖励机制，简单样本过多导致RL训练效率低下

Method: 提出DSCL框架，包含基于多维度奖励统计的奖励动态采样和基于子任务掌握程度的任务动态课程学习

Result: 在BFCLv3基准上实现3.29%的性能提升，显著优于强基线方法

Conclusion: DSCL有效利用工具学习中的复杂奖励信号和子任务动态，为工具学习提供了定制化的高效解决方案

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training
efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\%
improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution
that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics
within tool learning to achieve superior results.

Motivation: 传统图压缩方法严重依赖特定GNN架构和任务监督，限制了其在不同任务和架构间的可重用性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于最优传输的预训练图压缩框架，包括混合间隔图扩散增强、最优图传输与表示传输匹配、可追溯语义协调器。

Result: 大量实验验证了PreGC的优越性和多功能性，展示了其任务无关特性以及与任意GNN的无缝兼容性。

Conclusion: PreGC通过优化一致性视角重新定义了图压缩目标，成功解决了传统方法的局限性，为图压缩提供了更加通用和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) aims to distill the original graph into a small-scale
graph, mitigating redundancy and accelerating GNN training. However,
conventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific
supervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and
generalization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit
the goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and
then a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those
traditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this
optimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC)
via optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and
architecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph
diffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability
of the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty
of node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan
and representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic
consistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing
graph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation
of condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic
harmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic
associations through the optimized representation transport plan in
pre-training. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and versatility of
PreGC, demonstrating its task-independent nature and seamless compatibility
with arbitrary GNNs.

Method: 在cell2sentence模型上训练transcoder，利用transcoder提取模型的内部决策电路

Result: 提取的决策电路对应真实世界的生物机制，证实了transcoder在揭示复杂单细胞模型中生物学通路方面的潜力

Conclusion: transcoder技术能够有效提取单细胞基础模型中的可解释决策电路，为理解这些复杂模型的生物学基础提供了新途径

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance on various tasks, such as cell-type annotation and perturbation
response prediction, by learning gene regulatory networks from large-scale
transcriptome data. However, a significant challenge remains: the
decision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to
traditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently,
transcoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable
decision circuits from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we train a
transcoder on the cell2sentence (C2S) model, a state-of-the-art scFM. By
leveraging the trained transcoder, we extract internal decision-making circuits
from the C2S model. We demonstrate that the discovered circuits correspond to
real-world biological mechanisms, confirming the potential of transcoders to
uncover biologically plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的一步多视图聚类方法OMCAL，通过自适应低秩锚图学习解决现有方法的信息冗余和噪声问题，同时将聚类指示器获取与锚图学习统一到单一框架中，显著提升聚类效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锚图多视图聚类方法存在两个主要问题：1）直接将多样锚图嵌入共识锚图，忽略了冗余信息和噪声，导致聚类效果下降；2）需要独立后处理获取聚类指示器，影响效率和效果。

Method: 提出OMCAL方法，使用基于核范数的自适应共识锚图学习模型来对抗信息冗余和噪声干扰，并将类别指示器获取与共识锚图学习整合到统一框架中。

Result: 在普通和大规模数据集上的大量实验表明，OMCAL在聚类效果和效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: OMCAL方法通过自适应低秩锚图学习和统一框架设计，有效解决了多视图聚类中的信息冗余、噪声干扰和效率问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing
computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods
have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems.
Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1)
They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph
(CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in
these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They
drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire
clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a
novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph
learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear
norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise
interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency
substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning
into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and
large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: FlowCast-ODE通过连续流建模和ODE求解器成功解决了小时级天气预测的关键挑战，在精度、计算效率和极端事件预测方面都表现出色，为高分辨率天气预报提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour
intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a
critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors
in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's
12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a
framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow.
FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state,
an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and
enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train
the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly
data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to
achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank
AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15%
without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE
outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and
better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more
fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons.
Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with
assimilation cycle transitions.

Conclusion: 简单的算法改进能够在计算资源丰富的未来实现显著的数据效率提升，为解决训练数据不足问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Since compute grows much faster than web text available for language model
pre-training, we ask how one should approach pre-training under fixed data and
no compute constraints. We first show that existing data-constrained approaches
of increasing epoch count and parameter count eventually overfit, and we
significantly improve upon such recipes by properly tuning regularization,
finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\times$ larger than standard
practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a
simple power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance
via the asymptote of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed
compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models
achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our
best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and
ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\times$ less
data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement
persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be
realized at much smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a
student model that is 8$\times$ smaller and retains $83\%$ of the ensembling
benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to
downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9\%$ improvement for pre-training evals and
a $17.5\times$ data efficiency improvement over continued pre-training on math
mid-training data. Our results show that simple algorithmic improvements can
enable significantly more data-efficient pre-training in a compute-rich future.

Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central
challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer
scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction
framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while

benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and
BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening
tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in
AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned
aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing
predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial
correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention
patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's
utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.

Abstract: While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and
effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for
evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to
unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing
frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP
-- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a
unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and
evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We
demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1)
the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint
modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the
vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution
shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift
the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model
behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.

Motivation: 协方差矩阵通常密集、无法编码条件独立性，且通常是任务无关的预计算，这限制了性能。精度矩阵（逆协方差）天然编码统计独立性、通常稀疏，并保持协方差谱结构。

Method: 提出精度神经网络(PNNs)，将VNNs应用于精度矩阵。通过交替优化联合学习网络参数和精度矩阵，依次更新网络权重和精度估计。

Result: 理论证明了每次迭代中估计精度矩阵与真实精度矩阵之间的距离界限，在合成和真实数据上展示了联合估计相比两步方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PNNs通过联合学习精度矩阵和网络参数，克服了协方差矩阵的局限性，提供了更有效的协方差学习方法。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform convolutions on the graph
determined by the covariance matrix of the data, which enables expressive and
stable covariance-based learning. However, covariance matrices are typically
dense, fail to encode conditional independence, and are often precomputed in a
task-agnostic way, which may hinder performance. To overcome these limitations,
we study Precision Neural Networks (PNNs), i.e., VNNs on the precision matrix
-- the inverse covariance. The precision matrix naturally encodes statistical
independence, often exhibits sparsity, and preserves the covariance spectral
structure. To make precision estimation task-aware, we formulate an
optimization problem that jointly learns the network parameters and the
precision matrix, and solve it via alternating optimization, by sequentially
updating the network weights and the precision estimate. We theoretically bound
the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each
iteration, and demonstrate the effectiveness of joint estimation compared to
two-step approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: 使用DST进行随机优化可获得更高效的决策策略，通过更好地处理不确定性，比使用相同扩散预测器的确定性和随机MPC变体获得更高性能

Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain
systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full
distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario
Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for
multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting
models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a
tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on
observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization
task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same
optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models
and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for
stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving
higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and
stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.

Conclusion: MF-HRL-IGM能够有效利用多保真度模拟器资源，在限定成本下实现更高效的策略优化，为实际应用提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive
interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often
costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training
from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the
size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both
offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In
many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of
fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study
multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We
introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization
(MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity
selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping
approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of
MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 全局到局部注意力方案是可行的，G2LFormer能够有效防止节点忽略其直接邻居，在性能和可扩展性之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation
learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to
attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention
scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures
long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer
from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN
could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,
featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network
layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper
layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby
preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective
cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to
retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information
loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of
the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with
state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The
results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping
linear complexity.

Result: 完整模型性能最优；双域变体显著逊色，证实时空频域异质信息融合至关重要；无交叉融合版本性能下降最严重，证明交互融合模块是最关键组件

Conclusion: DPANet的双域融合设计和交叉注意力机制是模型成功的关键，异质信息交互融合对性能提升具有决定性作用

Abstract: We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components
(Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all
variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized
versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a
Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants
underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous
temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the
cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the
most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our
interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is
crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning.
The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the
estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of
vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of
these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic
approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph
topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of
low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through
extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy
function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph
learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can
recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes.
Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.

Abstract: Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due
to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay
channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process
for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed
analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic
overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the
simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process
typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic
method exists.
  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,
we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the
critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty
hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is
broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from
a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits
the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with
highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs
to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful
trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also
incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token
sequences representing decays.

Conclusion: 提出的广义框架为持久图分析提供了更强的鲁棒性，Python实现已开源

Abstract: This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein
barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing
assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between
the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works
for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when
$q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter
diagram for generic transportation costs ($q > 1$), in particular those robust
to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two
applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric
space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both
scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our
generalized framework. Our Python implementation is available at this address:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods that incorporate deep neural networks
(DNN), though powerful, often lack transparency. Their black-box characteristic
hinders interpretability and reduces trustworthiness, particularly in critical
domains. To address this challenge in RL tasks, we propose a solution based on
Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) along with explanation extraction
methods to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our
approach targets low-dimensionality problems to generate robust local and
global explanations of the model's behaviour. We evaluate the proposed method
on the resource allocation problem in mobile networks, demonstrating that SENNs
can constitute interpretable solutions with competitive performance. This work
highlights the potential of SENNs to improve transparency and trust in
AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional tasks. Our approach strong
performance on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while providing
robust explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DAG框架，利用时间和通道维度的双重因果网络来处理带外生变量的时间序列预测，解决了现有方法无法利用未来外生变量和忽略因果关系的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中仅关注内生变量（目标变量）往往无法保证准确预测，外生变量（协变量）能提供额外预测信息。但现有方法存在两个主要缺陷：1）无法利用未来外生变量，2）忽略了内生和外生变量间的因果关系。

Method: 提出DAG框架，包含两个核心模块：时间因果模块（Temporal Causal Module）- 通过因果发现捕获历史外生变量如何影响未来外生变量，并通过因果注入将发现的因果关系整合到预测过程中；通道因果模块（Channel Causal Module）- 类似地建模历史外生变量如何影响历史内生变量，并利用这些关系增强基于未来外生变量的预测。

Result: 通过双重因果网络的设计，能够更好地利用外生变量特别是未来外生变量，解决了现有方法的性能次优问题。

Conclusion: DAG框架通过时间和通道维度的因果建模，显著提升了带外生变量时间序列预测的准确性，为实际应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics,
traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the
endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure
accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)
provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting
accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous
variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage
future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal
relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their
performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous
variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework
DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel
dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,
we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal
discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future
exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module
that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of
forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous
variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar
design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical
exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal
injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the
prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

Abstract: Social media has become a key medium of communication in today's society.
This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots)
to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to
such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language
models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the
effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and decoder
transformers. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these
classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater
accuracy and robustness. However, decoder-based models showed greater
adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for
generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa.
These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments
being manipulated while protecting the integrity of online discussion.

Conclusion: 基于社交网络移动性的分层联邦学习框架能够有效平衡数据隐私保护和模型性能优化，在资源受限环境下实现高效的联邦学习过程。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows
collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting
data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically
preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private,
whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling.
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on
the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data
sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of
limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource
allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy
consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce
the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate.
We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model
performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization
problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary
experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with
Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing
energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Malnutrition among pregnant women is a major public health challenge in
Ethiopia, increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex and
multidimensional determinants of nutritional status. This study develops a
predictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data
from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108
records with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing
included handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE,
followed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised
ensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost
were applied to classify nutritional status. Among them, the Random Forest
model achieved the best performance, classifying women into four categories
(normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, and overnutrition) with
97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86%
ROC AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in
capturing hidden patterns from complex datasets and provide timely insights for
early detection of nutritional risks. The results offer practical implications
for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, supporting data-driven
strategies to improve maternal nutrition and health outcomes in Ethiopia.

Motivation: 许多机器学习应用（如大语言模型训练和强化学习）中存在重尾噪声的随机梯度评估问题，现有方法在重尾噪声下的双层优化理论分析不足。

Method: 提出嵌套循环归一化随机双层逼近算法(N²SBA)，通过归一化技术处理重尾噪声，使用随机一阶oracle进行梯度评估。

Result: 获得了SFO复杂度为Õ(κ^(7p-3)/(p-1) σ^(p/(p-1)) ε^(-4p-2)/(p-1))的ε-稳定点，在p=2时与有界方差情况下的最佳结果匹配。

Conclusion: 该算法在重尾噪声下实现了最优复杂度，扩展了双层优化和极小极大优化的理论边界，为实际应用提供了理论保证。

Abstract: This paper considers the smooth bilevel optimization in which the lower-level
problem is strongly convex and the upper-level problem is possibly nonconvex.
We focus on the stochastic setting that the algorithm can access the unbiased
stochastic gradient evaluation with heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in
many machine learning applications such as training large language models and
reinforcement learning. We propose a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel
approximation (N$^2$SBA) for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the
stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number,
$p\in(1,2]$ is the order of central moment for the noise, and $\sigma$ is the
noise level. Furthermore, we specialize our idea to solve the
nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem, achieving an
$\epsilon$-stationary point with the SFO complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal
O}\big(\kappa^{\frac{2p-1}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\big)$. All above upper bounds match the best-known
results under the special case of the bounded variance setting, i.e., $p=2$.

Conclusion: FAWN通过融合多种无线技术信号，显著提高了ISAC被动感知的精度和覆盖范围，为智能无线环境感知提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The upcoming generations of wireless technologies promise an era where
everything is interconnected and intelligent. As the need for intelligence
grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However,
deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always
feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.
Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses
wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with
existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are
limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum
accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we
see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage
area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a
MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.
FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information
from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical
world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution,
we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show
errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明AGCN在性能上超越了最先进的方法

Conclusion: 注意力机制在图学习中并非冗余，AGCN通过重新诠释"图即注意力"的概念，有效结合了全局信息提取和局部拓扑敏感性

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks,
driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to
graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential,
remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize
neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations.
Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at
the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question:
Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address
this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the
complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated
by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a
novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN
directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling
effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local
topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast
AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV
cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin
contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but
their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral
cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning
stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage
post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral
cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,
Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a
well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of
robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human
supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot
embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on
Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT
and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling
imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to
policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight
that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key
to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination
uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously
practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors
observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained
foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill
acquisition in robotics. Our project website can be found at

Result: 在四个非平稳基准测试中，DEER比现有最佳经验回放方法性能提升11.54%

Conclusion: DEER能够有效处理非平稳环境中的强化学习问题，通过区分策略和环境变化实现更高效的样本利用

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as
changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated.
Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error
prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's
policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under
dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of
Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment
shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of
Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that
prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.
DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies
distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more
sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks
demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms
by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.

found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an
anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time
series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time
series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing
approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally)
independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach
addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and
decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics,
and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture
temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a
multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components
are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive
learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate
normal and anomaly samples.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，结合无监督模式提取和可解释预测，在金融方向预测中实现高准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融方向预测中传统方法泛化能力差和深度学习模型缺乏可解释性的问题

Method: 两阶段方法：SIMPC（分割聚类多变量时间序列提取模式）+ JISC-Net（基于shapelet的分类器进行短期方向预测）

Result: 在比特币和3只标普500股票上，12个指标-数据集组合中11个排名第一或第二，持续超越基线

Conclusion: 该方法通过揭示驱动预测结果的底层模式结构，实现了透明决策，优于传统深度学习方法

Abstract: Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and
interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches
based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness
and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models
can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.
To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates
unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC
segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns
that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under
varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses
the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent
partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin
and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in
11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming
baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell
signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent
decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive
predictive outcomes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from
sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper
presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning
with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a
multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and
Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention
mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited
significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies
despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid
methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from
rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid
approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents,
substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed
high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture
enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining
training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based
initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust
solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments
where pure exploration proves insufficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split Learning训练过程中需要传输大量中间Vision Transformers激活数据，通信开销巨大，需要开发高效的压缩方法来减少通信成本。

Method: 采用两种并行压缩策略：1)基于注意力分数合并相似样本激活（类无关方式）；2)丢弃最不重要的token。两种策略结合实现前向和反向传播的自然压缩。

Result: ADC框架显著降低了通信开销，同时保持了高准确率，性能优于现有的Split Learning框架。

Conclusion: 基于注意力的双重压缩策略有效解决了Split Learning中的通信瓶颈问题，无需额外调优即可实现端到端的高效训练。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ℓ0正则化回归中的计算效率问题，传统蒙特卡洛方法收敛慢，需要开发更高效的方法。同时探索非线性压缩感知中参数恢复的理论和实际可行性。

Method: 采用平滑概率重构ℓ0正则化，避免蒙特卡洛采样，实现精确梯度计算。理论分析基于Fefferman和Markel定理，实验使用正态形式算法选择对称类中的规范代表。

Result: 方法收敛速度显著提升，在多种设置和信噪比下优于IHT和Lasso等压缩感知算法。非线性压缩感知中观察到参数恢复存在反弹效应，即使测试损失持续下降，师生配置也会发散。

Conclusion: 提出的概率化方法在计算效率和性能上均有显著改进。非线性压缩感知存在根本性差异，精确参数恢复即使考虑对称性也不可行，这为后续研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized
regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the
computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima
of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves
convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing
algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and
signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and
GPUs and is freely available at
https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive
sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network
is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of
Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the
infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical
validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical
representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help
to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even
possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound
effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but
subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings
indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive
sensing.

Result: 在Abilene和GÉANT数据集上，方法分别减少RMSE达92%和75%；在路由场景中，最大链路利用率偏差分别减少18%和21%

Conclusion: 时间序列聚类能够有效提高流量预测的准确性，并在网络优化应用中带来实际效益

Abstract: We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve
internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models.
Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can
hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To
address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and
histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to
model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling
models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better
than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM.
Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to
92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered
predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%,
respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are
used for network optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary multi-armed bandits enable agents to adapt to changing
environments by incorporating mechanisms to detect and respond to shifts in
reward distributions, making them well-suited for dynamic settings. However,
existing approaches typically assume that reward feedback is available at every
round - an assumption that overlooks many real-world scenarios where feedback
is limited. In this paper, we take a significant step forward by introducing a
new model of constrained feedback in non-stationary multi-armed bandits, where
the availability of reward feedback is restricted. We propose the first
prior-free algorithm - that is, one that does not require prior knowledge of
the degree of non-stationarity - that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret in
this setting. Specifically, our algorithm attains a dynamic regret of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$, where $T$ is the
number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, $B$ is the query budget, and $V_T$
is the variation budget capturing the degree of non-stationarity.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental
sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by
limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven
agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and
synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative
modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised
learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model
(VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air
quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of
pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve
transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs
can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing
situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time
forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and
demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and
semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further
incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility,
clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable
and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN
architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time
inference on edge platforms.

Conclusion: FedLEASE有效解决了联邦LoRA微调中的专家分配和选择问题，为LLM在隐私保护下的领域适应提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various tasks, but fine-tuning them for domain-specific applications often
requires substantial domain-specific data that may be distributed across
multiple organizations. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but faces challenges with computational constraints when applied to
LLMs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach, though a single LoRA module often struggles with
heterogeneous data across diverse domains. This paper addresses two critical
challenges in federated LoRA fine-tuning: 1. determining the optimal number and
allocation of LoRA experts across heterogeneous clients, and 2. enabling
clients to selectively utilize these experts based on their specific data
characteristics. We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation
and SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on
representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts.
It also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows
each client to select the optimal number of utilized experts. Our extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLEASE
significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in
heterogeneous client settings while maintaining communication efficiency.

Conclusion: 模型多样性增加使凸包条件更易满足，战略竞争可作为实现AI对齐的有效替代方案，即使单个模型不完全对齐。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values remains a fundamental challenge, but
does our inability to create perfectly aligned models preclude obtaining the
benefits of alignment? We study a strategic setting where a human user
interacts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are
individually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies
approximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that
becomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition
can yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We
model this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to
multi-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three
results: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her
Bayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex
hull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility
learning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal
utility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI
after an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without
further distributional assumptions. We complement the theory with two sets of
experiments.

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep learning, particularly in
large-scale architectures such as foundation models and large language models
(LLMs), pose significant challenges to sustainability. Traditional
gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative
updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based
direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural
network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step
equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction,
while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual
updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both
hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning
with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive
decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances
scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of
sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate
that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high
model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time
adaptation in energy-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 当前基准存在重要临床弱点，强调需要临床验证的数据集和更公平的评估框架来提升AI在胸部X光诊断中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown significant promise in chest radiography,
where deep learning models can approach radiologist-level diagnostic
performance. Progress has been accelerated by large public datasets such as
MIMIC-CXR, ChestX-ray14, PadChest, and CheXpert, which provide hundreds of
thousands of labelled images with pathology annotations. However, these
datasets also present important limitations. Automated label extraction from
radiology reports introduces errors, particularly in handling uncertainty and
negation, and radiologist review frequently disagrees with assigned labels. In
addition, domain shift and population bias restrict model generalisability,
while evaluation practices often overlook clinically meaningful measures. We
conduct a systematic analysis of these challenges, focusing on label quality,
dataset bias, and domain shift. Our cross-dataset domain shift evaluation
across multiple model architectures revealed substantial external performance
degradation, with pronounced reductions in AUPRC and F1 scores relative to
internal testing. To assess dataset bias, we trained a source-classification
model that distinguished datasets with near-perfect accuracy, and performed
subgroup analyses showing reduced performance for minority age and sex groups.
Finally, expert review by two board-certified radiologists identified
significant disagreement with public dataset labels. Our findings highlight
important clinical weaknesses of current benchmarks and emphasise the need for
clinician-validated datasets and fairer evaluation frameworks.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型缺乏时间一致性，导致策略更新无效和强化学习训练不稳定，需要更平滑可靠的奖励模型。

Method: 提出TDRM方法，通过在训练过程中最小化时间差异来学习更平滑的奖励模型，结合时间差分正则化产生平滑奖励并更好对齐长期目标。

Result: TD训练的过程奖励模型在Best-of-N设置中提升6.6%，树搜索设置中提升23.7%；与RLVR结合时，仅需2.5k数据即可达到基线方法50.1k数据的性能，在8个模型变体上获得更高质量的语言模型策略。

Conclusion: TDRM是一种有效的奖励模型训练方法，能够显著提升强化学习性能和数据效率，可作为可验证奖励方法的补充使用。

Abstract: Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language
models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often
lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable
RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more
reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This
temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves
alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic
style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that
TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in
series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve
performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%)
settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable

TL;DR: 提出一种结合随机零阶优化和动态低秩代理模型的框架，用于终端到终端训练包含非可微物理组件的混合深度学习模型，达到接近数字基线的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对能源效率高、性能强的AI系统需求的增长，光子学、神经形态等替代计算平台受到越来越多关注。但将这些物理组件集成到深度学习流程中面临挑战，因为物理设备通常表达能力有限且非可微，导致在设备上进行反向传播困难或不可行。

Method: 设计了一种组合随机零阶优化和动态低秩代理模型的框架。关键技术是隐式投影器-分割积分算法，该算法在每次前向传播后以最小化硬件查询为代价更新轻量级代理模型，避免了费用高昂的全矩阵重构。

Result: 在多种深度学习任务中进行了测试，包括计算机视觉、音频分类和语言建模。在所有模态下，该方法都达到了接近数字基线的准确性，并一贯地实现了包含各种非可微物理组件（空间光调制器、微环形共振器、马赫-乃德干涉仪等）的混合模型的有效终端到终端训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作桥接了硬件感知深度学习和无梯度优化，为将非可微物理组件集成到可扩展、可终端到终端训练的AI系统中提供了实用的途径。

Abstract: The growing demand for energy-efficient, high-performance AI systems has led
to increased attention on alternative computing platforms (e.g., photonic,
neuromorphic) due to their potential to accelerate learning and inference.
However, integrating such physical components into deep learning pipelines
remains challenging, as physical devices often offer limited expressiveness,
and their non-differentiable nature renders on-device backpropagation difficult
or infeasible. This motivates the development of hybrid architectures that
combine digital neural networks with reconfigurable physical layers, which
effectively behave as black boxes. In this work, we present a framework for the
end-to-end training of such hybrid networks. This framework integrates
stochastic zeroth-order optimization for updating the physical layer's internal
parameters with a dynamic low-rank surrogate model that enables gradient
propagation through the physical layer. A key component of our approach is the
implicit projector-splitting integrator algorithm, which updates the
lightweight surrogate model after each forward pass with minimal hardware
queries, thereby avoiding costly full matrix reconstruction. We demonstrate our
method across diverse deep learning tasks, including: computer vision, audio
classification, and language modeling. Notably, across all modalities, the
proposed approach achieves near-digital baseline accuracy and consistently
enables effective end-to-end training of hybrid models incorporating various
non-differentiable physical components (spatial light modulators, microring
resonators, and Mach-Zehnder interferometers). This work bridges hardware-aware
deep learning and gradient-free optimization, thereby offering a practical
pathway for integrating non-differentiable physical components into scalable,
end-to-end trainable AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景如医学影像应用中，需要为回归模型预测提供可靠的置信区间。传统共形预测方法在校准集包含噪声标签时性能会下降，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 首先建立数学基础程序来估计无噪声CP阈值，然后将其转化为实用算法，克服回归问题连续性质带来的挑战。在带有高斯标签噪声的医学影像回归数据集上进行评估。

Result: 所提方法显著优于现有替代方案，实现了接近干净标签设置下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理校准集中的标签噪声问题，为高风险应用中的回归模型提供了更可靠的置信区间估计。

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios, such as medical imaging applications, it is
critical to equip the predictions of a regression model with reliable
confidence intervals. Recently, Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a
powerful statistical framework that, based on a labeled calibration set,
generates intervals that include the true labels with a pre-specified
probability. In this paper, we address the problem of applying CP for
regression models when the calibration set contains noisy labels. We begin by
establishing a mathematically grounded procedure for estimating the noise-free
CP threshold. Then, we turn it into a practical algorithm that overcomes the
challenges arising from the continuous nature of the regression problem. We
evaluate the proposed method on two medical imaging regression datasets with
Gaussian label noise. Our method significantly outperforms the existing
alternative, achieving performance close to the clean-label setting.

Motivation: 受在线广告问题启发，解决从标签比例学习(LLP)的任务，其中训练数据只有分组的平均标签信息，但需要预测个体样本标签。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的低方差去偏方法，能够灵活适应各种实际相关的损失函数，结合标准技术来改进样本复杂度保证。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，相比标准基线方法展现出显著的实证优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为从聚合标签信息学习提供了灵活有效的解决方案，显著推进了LLP领域的技术水平。

Abstract: Motivated by problems in online advertising, we address the task of Learning
from Label Proportions (LLP). In this partially-supervised setting, training
data consists of groups of examples, termed bags, for which we only observe the
average label value. The main goal, however, remains the design of a predictor
for the labels of individual examples. We introduce a novel and versatile
low-variance de-biasing methodology to learn from aggregate label information,
significantly advancing the state of the art in LLP. Our approach exhibits
remarkable flexibility, seamlessly accommodating a broad spectrum of
practically relevant loss functions across both binary and multi-class
classification settings. By carefully combining our estimators with standard
techniques, we substantially improve sample complexity guarantees for a large
class of losses of practical relevance. We also empirically validate the
efficacy of our proposed approach across a diverse array of benchmark datasets,
demonstrating compelling empirical advantages over standard baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究了联邦学习中基于logit的聚合方法，比较了三种logit聚合策略：简单平均、不确定性加权平均和学习型元聚合器，在减少通信开销的同时保持了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习共享模型权重或梯度的通信成本高昂，特别是对于大模型。基于logit的联邦学习通过在公共代理数据集上共享logits来降低成本，但如何有效聚合来自异构客户端的信息仍具挑战。

Method: 提出并比较三种logit聚合方法：1）简单平均；2）不确定性加权平均；3）学习型元聚合器。在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行评估。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了通信开销，在非IID数据下提高了鲁棒性，达到了与集中式训练相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于logit的联邦学习聚合方法能够有效降低通信成本，同时在异构数据环境下保持模型性能，为大规模联邦学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) usually shares model weights or gradients, which is
costly for large models. Logit-based FL reduces this cost by sharing only
logits computed on a public proxy dataset. However, aggregating information
from heterogeneous clients is still challenging. This paper studies this
problem, introduces and compares three logit aggregation methods: simple
averaging, uncertainty-weighted averaging, and a learned meta-aggregator.
Evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10, these methods reduce communication overhead,
improve robustness under non-IID data, and achieve accuracy competitive with
centralized training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出数据重写框架，通过主动缩小策略差距来稳定监督微调，在数学推理基准上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调中的分布不匹配导致重要性采样方差大、训练不稳定，现有方法被动约束更新而非主动减小策略差距

Method: 数据重写框架：保留正确解作为同策略数据，重写错误解，仅在需要时回退到专家演示，在优化前对齐训练分布

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中相比原始SFT和最先进的DFT方法都取得了显著且一致的性能提升

Conclusion: 主动缩小策略差距的数据重写方法能有效降低重要性采样方差，稳定离策略微调过程

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an
off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed
behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance
sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but
large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing
approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively
constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple
yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap
by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones
with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed.
This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before
optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy
fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released at
https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Off-Policy-SFT.

Motivation: 现有嵌入式微处理器缺乏对混合精度神经网络的高效架构支持，导致数据打包/解包开销大和算术单元利用率低的问题

Conclusion: 提出的跨层硬件软件协同设计框架有效解决了混合精度神经网络在嵌入式处理器上的执行效率问题，显著提升了能效和性能

Abstract: The evolution of quantization and mixed-precision techniques has unlocked new
possibilities for enhancing the speed and energy efficiency of NNs. Several
recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different
parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while
significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded
microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing
mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,
resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and
underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions
and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize
mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on
RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software
co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a
combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level
optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance
the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for
weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while
implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we
integrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and
a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal
mixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost
the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely
used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our
framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss
and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up
to 1.8 TOPs/W.

TL;DR: EVOL-RL是一种无标签强化学习方法，通过结合多数投票稳定性和语义空间新颖性奖励，防止语言模型在自改进过程中出现熵崩溃，保持探索能力和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无标签方法（如置信度最小化、自一致性、多数投票）虽然稳定学习但会缩小探索空间，导致生成内容变短、多样性减少的熵崩溃问题。需要一种既能自我改进又不牺牲模型探索能力和泛化性的方法。

Method: 提出EVOL-RL方法：使用多数投票答案作为稳定锚点（选择），同时添加新颖性奖励鼓励与已有推理不同的响应（变异），在语义空间中测量差异。采用GRPO实现，使用非对称裁剪保留强信号和熵正则化维持搜索。

Result: EVOL-RL显著优于多数投票TTRL基线：在无标签AIME24训练下，Qwen3-4B-Base模型在AIME25上的pass@1从4.6%提升到16.4%，pass@16从18.5%提升到37.9%。同时防止多样性崩溃，在跨领域（如GPQA）展现更强泛化能力，在RLVR设置中也表现优异。

Conclusion: EVOL-RL通过选择+变异的简单设计有效解决了无标签强化学习中的熵崩溃问题，不仅保持模型探索能力，还提升了泛化性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands
models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing
label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote
objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an
entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike
prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which
primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is
broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's
inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We
formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free
Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with
variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer
as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors
responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced
(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also
uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer
to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design
prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and
improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the
majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts
Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%
to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks
stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,
highlighting its broad applicability.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis,
enabling automatic annotation, disease screening, and prognosis beyond
traditional clinical capabilities. However, understanding these models remains
a challenge, limiting interpretation and gaining knowledge from these
developments. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability method for
convolutional neural networks applied to ECG analysis. Our approach extracts
time-localized clusters from the model's internal representations, segmenting
the ECG according to the learned characteristics while quantifying the
uncertainty of these representations. This allows us to visualize how different
waveform regions contribute to the model's predictions and assess the certainty
of its decisions. By providing a structured and interpretable view of deep
learning models for ECG, our method enhances trust in AI-driven diagnostics and
facilitates the discovery of clinically relevant electrophysiological patterns.

Motivation: 现有因果公平性方法通常需要已知因果模型或依赖强假设，无法有效捕捉关键属性关系来保持数据效用

Method: 将复杂因果公平关系提取任务转化为定制分布估计问题，采用低维边际分解近似联合分布，配合启发式算法解决计算挑战

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CausalPre既有效又可扩展

Conclusion: 挑战了传统观念，证明实现因果公平性无需在关系覆盖和模型假设之间进行权衡

Abstract: Causal fairness in databases is crucial to preventing biased and inaccurate
outcomes in downstream tasks. While most prior work assumes a known causal
model, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional
constraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute
relationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a
fundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design
efficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong
assumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer
this question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective
causality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable
fairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair
relationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally
infeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To
ensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of
low-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,
complemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated
computational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the
conventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off
relationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的奖励最大化方法（如PPO、GRPO）倾向于过度优化主导奖励信号，忽视较少出现但有效的推理路径，导致多样性降低

Method: 将标量奖励转换为使用可学习配分函数的归一化目标分布，然后最小化策略与目标分布之间的反向KL散度，实现为流平衡优化方法

Result: 在数学基准测试中平均比GRPO提升10.0%，比PPO提升5.1%，在代码推理任务中表现一致更好

Conclusion: 奖励分布匹配是实现LLM强化学习中高效探索和多样化推理的关键步骤

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
$10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.
