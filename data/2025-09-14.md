*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2是一个统一的检索模型，支持图像和文本组成的多模态查询，并能跨多模态文档集合进行检索，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效的多模态检索模型，能够统一处理多模态查询和文档检索，在性能和效率方面都优于现有方法，为多模态检索提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用视觉扩散模型(VDM)特征和transformer聚合，实现跨物种、视角和上下文的人类级动作识别泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别不同物种、视角和上下文下的相同动作，但当前深度学习模型在此类泛化方面存在困难

Method: 利用条件扩散模型在早期时间步生成的特征，通过transformer聚合，强调语义信息而非像素级细节

Result: 在跨物种、跨视角和跨上下文的三个泛化基准测试中均达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类水平的鲁棒性，为跨域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

### [3] [PromptGuard: An Orchestrated Prompting Framework for Principled Synthetic Text Generation for Vulnerable Populations using LLMs with Enhanced Safety, Fairness, and Controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08910)
*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术预防LLM生成有害信息，使用对比学习和多目标优化实现25-30%的危害减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动预防对弱势群体（LGBTQ+、单亲家庭、边缘化社区）的有害输出

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术：整合GitHub精选库的少样本示例、伦理思维链推理、自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化和形式化证明

Result: 通过熵界和帕累托最优性证明25-30%的分析性危害减少，建立基于GitHub数据集的理论验证框架

Conclusion: PromptGuard为系统性实证研究建立了数学基础，创建了实时危害预防的智能专家系统

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，通过Beta混合分布建模相似度分布来检测标签噪声，提升噪声环境下Re-ID性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ID方法对标签噪声高度敏感，现有方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要鲁棒的噪声处理方案

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合二元交叉熵、对比和余弦嵌入损失，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta混合分布建模嵌入对余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: Beta-SOD方法在噪声Re-ID场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性和广泛适用性，为处理标签噪声提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

### [5] [SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934)
*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个用于冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的端到端框架，通过多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提升了ICA图像中血管分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，侵入性冠状动脉造影（ICA）作为诊断金标准，需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像存在低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构等挑战，限制了现有方法的临床应用。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器中嵌入曲率感知结构增强（CASE）模块，利用多尺度响应突出细长管状血管结构；解码器中引入渐进高频感知（PHFP）模块，采用多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: SFD-Mamba2Net在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合多尺度结构先验、长程依赖建模和频域增强策略，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的挑战，为临床CAD诊断提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全自动化的桌面MRI预后桌架预测框架，通过结合自动分割算法和收录组学特征来预测盲肠盖肝转移症的手术预后生存期，效果超过现有临床和基因标记物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲肠盖肝转移症的手术预后差异较大，现有预测模型预测能力不足，特别是在多发性病例中。需要更准确的预测方法来改善病人结果。

Method: 开发了包含分割流水线和收录组学流水线的全自动框架。分割流水线利用提示基础模型完善部分标注数据，并提出SAMONAI算法实现单点提示传播。收录组学流水线使用SurvAMINN网络从右封住生存数据中聚焦最恶性肿瘤预测生存。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了自动化分割算法与收录组学生存分析相结合在盲肠盖肝转移病例中可以提供准确、标注高效且可解释的预后预测。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon算法通过进化搜索发现不同文本到图像模型输出的视觉属性差异，并揭示触发这些差异的提示概念


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示在何时以及如何出现分歧，发现一个模型产生而另一个模型不产生的视觉属性及其触发条件

Method: 提出CompCon进化搜索算法，自动发现模型输出中更普遍的视觉属性差异，并创建ID2数据集进行评估

Result: 成功比较了流行文本到图像模型，发现如PixArt在孤独提示中描绘湿街道，Stable Diffusion 3.5在媒体职业中描绘非裔美国人的差异表示

Conclusion: CompCon能够有效发现不同生成模型之间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏差和表示学习提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Result: 成功识别和提取云影及太阳耀斑区域，分离出未受干扰的清晰区域，实现了对受影响区域的恢复

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无人机水体影像中的云影和太阳耀斑问题，为准确估算水质参数提供了可靠的技术支持

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和变换器全局注意力的混合架构，在多个小规模图像分类数据集上显著提升了性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然能建模长距离依赖关系，但在小数据集上缺乏局部性和平移等变性的归纳偏置，导致局部特征提取不足

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力机制中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet上相比Swin Transformer分别提升2.17%、4.92%、0.10%、0.26%和4.47%

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合能有效增强变换器在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习来预测几何一致的置信矩阵，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局一致性的完全可微框架，以提高配准的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 首先使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，然后通过双向源到目标和目标到源匹配的重新定位步骤进行细化，最后通过全局几何一致性学习堆叠配对点特征来预测点对点匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到95%-97%的内点率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，在6-DoF姿态估计和部分到部分匹配任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过结合局部和全局几何一致性学习，显著提升了点云刚性配准性能，在多个真实世界数据集上实现了最先进的结果，证明了其在不同设置下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用超声B模式图像中的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改善3D形状重建的几何一致性，解决遮挡和标注依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SDF的隐式表示方法依赖精确标注且忽略B模式图像中的丰富声学信息，同时难以处理超声的视角依赖性和声影伪影问题

Method: 采用基于占据率的表示方法，提出UltrON框架利用声学特征进行弱监督优化，设计新型损失函数补偿视角依赖性，支持多视角超声优化

Result: UltrON能够从B模式图像中提取声学特征而无需额外标注成本，有效缓解遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提高3D重建准确性

Conclusion: 通过整合声学特性，UltrON能够泛化到相同解剖结构的形状重建，为更准确的3D重建开辟了新途径

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 自动量化心脏标记MRI中的心肌运动和应变是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要准确且可扩展的分析方法

Method: 使用基于学习潜在码的隐式神经表示(INRs)来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，实现了最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变误差(2.86%)和径向应变误差(6.42%)，速度比最准确基线快约380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适合在大规模心脏MRI数据集中进行准确且可扩展的心肌应变分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet通过动态加权策略改进通用域自适应，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更精确的边界区分机制

Method: 提出增强型互学习网络(E-MLNet)，集成动态加权策略到开放集熵最小化中，利用闭集分类器预测聚焦最相关的类边界

Result: 在四个基准测试中取得最佳平均H分数，在31个任务中22个开放部分DA和19个开放集DA任务上优于MLNet基线

Conclusion: 动态加权策略有效提升了已知和未知类别的区分能力，证明了聚焦自适应策略的优越性

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 乌尔都语有超过2.5亿使用者，但在多模态和视觉语言研究中严重缺乏资源。缺乏大规模高质量数据集限制了乌尔都语系统的发展，并加剧了多语言视觉语言模型对高资源语言的偏见。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集通过分层抽样选取图像，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，并通过混合多模态质量评估框架（包括COMET-Kiwi翻译质量评估、CLIP视觉相似度、BERTScore语义一致性）进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: 创建了包含5.9万张图片和31.9万条高质量乌尔都语标注的数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF等基准测试中表现优异，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语标注数据集。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础，促进乌尔都语在多模态研究中的发展。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

TL;DR: PCGM是一种新的3D脑MRI反事实生成方法，通过概率图模型整合解剖约束，使用ControlNet编码空间掩码来指导扩散模型生成高质量的解剖合理脑部图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实模型缺乏明确的解剖学归纳偏置，难以保持医学相关的细微局部变化，导致生成的脑部MRI在解剖学上不合理。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束并转换为空间二进制掩码，使用3D ControlNet编码掩码来约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最后通过3D扩散解码器生成高质量脑部MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCGM生成的脑部MRI质量优于多个基线方法，且从生成图像中提取的脑部测量结果能够复现神经科学文献中报道的疾病对皮层区域的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM在合成MRI用于研究细微形态差异方面取得了重要里程碑，首次证明反事实生成图像能够复现疾病对脑部区域的已知细微影响。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Conclusion: 背景拒绝技术进一步增强了系统稳健性而不伤害检测准确性，使得该方案特别适合动态空中对空环境中的可靠UAV感知应用

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Motivation: 当前多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合时容易保留过多背景或噪声信息，限制了感知性能，需要一种能自适应增强显著结构并抑制共享背景干扰的新方法。

Method: 提出IRDFusion框架，包含两个核心模块：MFRM（互特征精炼模块）用于增强模态内和模态间特征表示，DFFM（差分特征反馈模块）动态计算模态间差分特征作为指导信号，通过迭代反馈机制实现高质量跨模态融合。

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过迭代关系图差分引导的特征融合机制，能够渐进放大显著关系信号并抑制特征噪声，显著提升了多光谱目标检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Motivation: CLIP在人物表示学习中面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模标注的人物中心视觉语言数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征且易受噪声文本影响。

Method: 1) 开发基于MLLM的噪声抵抗数据构建流程，自动筛选和标注网络图像，创建包含500万高质量图像-文本对的WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，通过梯度注意力引导的双重掩码协同机制自适应掩码噪声文本标记，并加入掩码标记预测目标增强细粒度语义表示学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，GA-DMS在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据筛选和模型架构的协同改进，成功提升了CLIP在人物表示学习中的表现，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

*Bin Huang,Kang Chen,Bingxuan Li,Huafeng Liu,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量正弦图生成，并在多种PET任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标注数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1)Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量正弦图生成，性能可与大数据集训练模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、可解释且任务自适应的基础模型框架，为医学影像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

*Dylan Peek,Matthew P. Skerritt,Stephan Chalup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 神经网络在噪声环境下预测Betti数方面表现优于传统的持续同调方法，能够学习上下文和几何先验信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较持续同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)在从数据推断拓扑结构方面的噪声鲁棒性，探索ANN作为PH替代方案的潜力

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方复形和带符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行测试

Result: ANN在噪声条件下能够超越PH方法，这归因于ANN从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验的能力

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展初期，但ANN用于拓扑估计在结构噪声条件下为PH提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSIM是一个新的3D场景评估指标，专注于对象级别的感知评估，比现有指标更符合人类感知


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标主要评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。受神经心理学启发，认为人类识别3D场景时主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用目标检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的"对象性"，进行以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知，并通过多种方法分析了OSIM的特性

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估标准，有助于重新评估3D重建和生成模型的进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有调研大多按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集对架构进化的结构性压力。需要一个统一的框架来理解数据集、归纳偏置和架构之间的关系。

Method: 采用数据集驱动的视角，分析运动复杂性、时间范围、层次组成和多模态丰富性如何引导模型设计。重新解释了从两流、3D CNN到序列、Transformer和多模态基础模型等里程碑。

Result: 构建了一个统一的框架，提供了实践性指南，帮助在保持可扩展性和任务需求的同时，将模型设计与数据集不变性对齐。

Conclusion: 该调研为视频理解领域提供了既全面反思又具有预览性的路线图，通过统一数据集、归纳偏置和架构为一体的框架推动通用视频理解的发展。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛旨在解决病理学中多尺度细胞-组织关系理解的问题，通过提供包含673对多器官标注数据集的挑战，推动深度学习模型在细胞检测中融入多尺度语义信息，最佳模型相比基线取得了7.99 F1分数的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家在检查全玻片图像时会在不同放大倍数间切换以评估组织形态和细胞细节，但现有深度学习细胞检测模型难以模拟这种行为并学习不同尺度结构间的相互依赖语义。该领域的关键障碍是缺乏多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注的数据集。

Method: OCELOT 2023挑战赛收集了来自306个TCGA全玻片图像的673对标注数据，包含六个器官的重叠细胞检测和组织分割标注，分为训练、验证和测试子集。参与者开发了能够增强细胞-组织关系理解的模型。

Conclusion: 研究证明了将多尺度语义融入模型的必要性，OCELOT 2023挑战赛为理解细胞-组织相互作用的重要性提供了验证，并加速了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Motivation: 解决无人机图像中目标检测的挑战，包括小目标密集、尺度变化大和遮挡问题，需要提升检测精度同时保持实时性能。

Method: 引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样(AU/AD)机制减少特征传播误差，采用CSP-PAC并行空洞卷积进行特征融合，整合多尺度信息。

Result: 新设计的neck结构在小目标和密集目标检测上表现优越，保持实时检测速度且不增加计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 为实时检测系统提供了一种有效的特征编码设计方法，在无人机图像目标检测中实现了精度和速度的平衡。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架，通过提取关键知识、清除噪声和选择性整合策略，有效提升了知识基于视觉问答的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KB-VQA方法直接使用检索到的知识引入了大量噪声，影响回答准确性。需要一种能够减少知识冗余和提高知识相关性的方法。

Method: 1）从图像-问题对中提取关键部分构建低噪声查询 2）使用大模型识别和提取有益于回答的知识段落 3）采用选择性知识整合策略，只在模型信心不足时使用知识

Result: 广泛实验证明该框架在知识基于视觉问答任务上超越了现有的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该无需训练的知识聚焦框架能够有效减少知识冗余噪声，提高知识相关性，从而获得更准确的回答结果

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像虽然光谱信息丰富但存在特征冗余问题，传统方法分类性能受限，需要突破分类性能瓶颈

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱数据，提出CWSSNet框架，集成多模态信息的多尺度卷积注意力模块，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作

Result: 在余干县取得mIoU 74.50%、mAcc 82.73%、mF1 84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中IoU最高，小样本训练下性能可靠

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，提升了分类精度，具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本适应能力

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级自适应Dark-ISP插件，直接处理RAW图像来改善低光环境下的目标检测性能，避免信息损失和复杂框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光环境下的目标检测面临图像质量降级的挑战，虽然RAW图像比RGB图像更有潜力，但现有方法或有信息损失或复杂度高。

Method: 将传统ISP流水线解构为线性和非线性子模块，改造为可微分组件，通过任务驱动损失优化。每个模块具备内容感知适应性和物理先验知识，并设计了自成增机制促进子模块协作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的低光环境中，以最少的参数量超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于检测方法。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级且可端到端训练的解决方案，能够自动将RAW图像转换为与检测目标一致的RGB图像，在低光目标检测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨任务和解剖区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用next-scale自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细逐步细化预测，生成全分辨率体积输出；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时促进上下文与目标输入的长程交互。

Result: 在未见过的临床中心、器官、物种和成像模态的测试集上，Medverse显著优于现有上下文学习基线方法。

Conclusion: Medverse为医学影像上下文学习建立了新的范式，代码和模型权重将公开提供。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在牙科等专业领域的有效性尚未充分探索，特别是全景X射线由于密集解剖结构和细微病理线索带来的解释挑战未被现有医学基准覆盖

Method: 构建包含20,563张标注图像和130万指令实例的MMOral数据集，涵盖属性提取、报告生成、视觉问答和图像对话等任务类型。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B进行监督微调开发OralGPT模型

Conclusion: MMOral和OralGPT为智能牙科提供了重要基础，有望推动牙科领域多模态AI系统的临床应用发展

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

TL;DR: 提出了DATE方法，通过时间戳注入和语义引导的时间感知采样策略，显著提升多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中的时间推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时间理解能力下降

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时序感知相似性采样(TASS)：1)将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳交错构建连续时间参考系统 2)将视频采样重构为视觉语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在7B和72B模型上实现了小时级长视频基准测试的最先进性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超过了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式时间建模和语义引导采样，有效解决了长视频理解中的时间推理挑战，为多模态大语言模型的长视频处理提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割中资源消耗大、现有高效模型静态设计缺乏适应性的问题，需要一种能动态平衡性能与效率的方法。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Result: PSP-Seg-S轻量变体在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存使用减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是临床应用中成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Result: 在多样化的图表理解测试集上展现出强大且稳健的性能表现

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型不仅可以学会如何推理，还能够学会动态选择每个任务的最优推理路径，为图表理解领域提供了一种适应性更强的解决方案

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Motivation: 现有的多模态脑MRI分割模型要么局限于固定模态，要么在泛化到新模态时丢失模态特异性信息。需要开发能够处理任意可用成像模态的通用分割模型。

Method: 在U-net架构中集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定输入通道，通过图像增强方案合成人工MRI模态来训练模态无关组件，保持病理组织与健康组织的对比度同时维持解剖完整性。

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，结果显示该方法既能有效处理训练时见过的模态，又能处理新模态来改进分割效果。

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构改进和图像增强策略，成功实现了对任意MRI模态组合的分割能力，为临床应用中灵活使用不同成像模态提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一个针对SAR图像的目标中心学习框架，无需掩码标注就能将目标表征与背景杂波分离，通过多级特征提取和注意力机制实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）与目标具有相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级槽注意力模块整合多级特征，增强槽级表征区分度。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和槽注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波的分离问题，无需掩码标注即可获得清晰的目标表征。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Method: 将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理过程中通过自训练动态对齐特征，无需标注数据和联合训练

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的大量实验表明，PHCP在各种异构场景下都取得了强劲性能，仅使用少量无标注数据就能达到与SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP证明了在推理时直接解决异构协作感知问题的可行性，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Conclusion: 选择合适的预训练源至关重要，领域相关性和手术特定数据的结合能显著提升少样本手术技能评估的性能，但使用不相关的大规模数据源反而可能导致性能下降

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Method: 将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释阶段：去噪、数据一致性执行和采样；提出混合数据一致性模块，线性组合多个PnP式保真度项，直接在去噪估计上应用混合校正。

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果表明，该方法获得了更好的重建质量。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 这是一个全自动的两阶段框架，通过视神经镜壳直径测量和临床数据融合，实现无创的内须压分级预测，显著提升了测量准确性和可靠性。


<details>

Result: 方法在验证集上达到准确率0.845±0.071（五折交叉验证），在独立测试集上准确率为0.786，显著超过传统阈值方法（验证准确率0.637±0.111，测试准确率0.429）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过降低操作变异性和融合多源信息，为临床提供了可靠的无创内须压评估方法，在急性神经系统疾病患者管理方面具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业缺陷分割方法需要外部正常数据集对比，而集成电路图像布局多样且对齐困难，方法弱架

Method: 设计可学习正常信息提取器从测试图像聚合正常特征，通过一致性损失确保特征与正常区域关联，使用解码器重建正常内容，并利用假异常增广稳定训练

Result: 在三个IC制造过程步骤的数据集上均显示出比现有方法更一致的改进，并具有强壁的对产品变异性的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该无监督框架能够有效分割IC制造中的缺陷，无需外部正常数据支持，适应不同产品布局的变化

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

TL;DR: FS-Diff是一种基于扩散模型的联合图像融合和超分辨率方法，通过语义引导和清晰度感知机制，在低分辨率感知和跨模态特征提取方面表现出色，在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现实应用中（如军事侦察和远程检测），多模态图像中的目标和背景结构容易损坏，存在低分辨率和弱语义信息的问题，导致现有融合技术效果不佳。

Method: 将图像融合和超分辨率统一为条件生成问题，利用清晰度感知机制提供语义引导，采用双向特征Mamba提取全局特征，通过改进的U-Net网络实现随机迭代去噪过程。

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了局部与全局运动耦合的建模问题

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型主要关注架构创新和训练目标改进，但对特征表示能力的提升关注不足。研究发现特征对齐可以显著提升视频生成质量

Method: 提出多特征融合和对齐方法Align4Gen，首先分析评估不同视觉编码器的判别性和时间一致性，然后将其集成到视频扩散模型训练中

Result: 在无条件视频生成和类别条件视频生成任务上，Align4Gen方法在各种评估指标上都显示出改进的视频生成效果

Conclusion: 特征对齐是提升视频扩散模型性能的有效策略，Align4Gen方法通过精心选择的视觉编码器特征对齐实现了显著的生成质量提升

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

TL;DR: InterAct是一个大规模3D人-物交互基准数据集，通过整合和优化现有数据，解决了现有数据集在运动质量、标注和接触伪影方面的不足，提供了30.7小时的高质量HOI数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模人体运动捕捉数据集在人-物交互（HOI）建模方面存在局限性，包括数据质量不高、标注不完善以及接触穿透、漂浮、手部运动不正确等伪影问题。

Method: 1）整合和标准化21.81小时的HOI数据并添加详细文本标注；2）提出统一的优化框架，基于接触不变性原理减少伪影并修正手部运动，将数据集扩展到30.70小时；3）定义六个基准任务并开发统一的HOI生成建模方法。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集为解决3D人-物交互生成中的数据集限制问题提供了高质量的基础资源，将积极维护并公开可用以支持该领域的持续研究。

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct, and will be actively maintained.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于深度学习的阿尔茨海默病MRI诊断中存在的种族和性别偏见问题，发现模型会利用与保护属性相关的伪特征进行预测，导致对少数群体的性能偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部成像诊断中可能存在捷径学习问题，即使用与输出标签无关的伪特征进行预测，当这些特征与保护属性相关时，会导致对种族和性别等少数群体的性能偏见。

Method: 研究首先验证DL算法能否从3D脑MRI扫描中识别种族或性别，然后考察训练集不平衡是否导致模型性能下降，最后对保护属性和AD分类任务进行定量和定性特征归因分析，使用ResNet和SwinTransformer等多种模型和数据集。

Result: 实验证明基于深度学习的AD分类中存在种族和性别相关的捷径学习和偏见，模型确实能够从脑MRI中识别保护属性，训练集不平衡会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更公平的脑MRI深度学习诊断工具奠定了基础，揭示了当前算法中存在的偏见问题，需要进一步解决以确保医疗AI的公平性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

TL;DR: PeftCD是一个基于视觉基础模型(VFMs)和参数高效微调(PEFT)的变化检测框架，通过LoRA和Adapter模块实现高效任务适应，在多个遥感数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多时相多源遥感影像中伪变化普遍、标记样本稀缺和跨域泛化困难的问题

Method: 使用权重共享的Siamese编码器（基于SAM2或DINOv3），集成LoRA和Adapter模块进行参数高效微调，配合轻量级解码器

Result: 在SYSU-CD(IoU 73.81%)、WHUCD(92.05%)、MSRSCD(64.07%)、MLCD(76.89%)、CDD(97.01%)、S2Looking(52.25%)和LEVIR-CD(85.62%)等多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，具有精确边界划分和强伪变化抑制能力

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间实现了最佳平衡，为大规模VFM适应真实遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和照片级真实感人像生成的统一，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟人视频生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将指令条件仅视为声学或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，而没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这限制了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）导演生成蓝图视频，控制高级语义如角色动作和情感；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长达1080p和48fps的长时视频，在唇形同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为基于语义的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学临床决策至关重要，特别是在数据有限的情况下需要生物学信息支持的图像生成方法。

Method: 使用常微分方程系统的机制模型捕捉肿瘤动态（包括放疗效果），结合梯度引导的DDIM扩散模型进行图像合成，使生成图像与预测生长和患者解剖结构对齐。

Result: 在BraTS成人和儿童胶质瘤数据集上训练，在60个儿童弥漫中线胶质瘤病例上评估，生成逼真的随访扫描，并提供了捕获肿瘤生长范围和方向性的概率图。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在数据有限的情况下实现生物学信息支持的图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测。

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要关注识别准确性，但忽略了模型识别"没有正确答案"这一关键能力，这在安全关键应用中至关重要。

Method: 基于全景场景图数据集，利用细粒度场景图注释提取真实实体和关系，使用GPT-4-Turbo生成多选题并经过人工筛选，每个问题都包含"以上都不是"选项。

Result: 评估了多种先进MLLM模型，包括通用和专用推理模型，提供了有价值的发现和见解。

Conclusion: HumbleBench填补了当前评估套件的关键空白，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更现实的衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: 通过Auto-Encoder视角提出UAE框架，将图像理解作为编码器(I2T)压缩图像为文本，图像生成作为解码器(T2I)从文本重建图像，使用重建保真度作为统一训练目标实现双向信息流和相互增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立统一的多模态学习框架，通过重建保真度目标实现图像理解和生成之间的双向协同，提升两个任务的性能。

Method: 提出UAE框架：1)使用大规模长上下文图像标题预训练解码器；2)通过强化学习提出Unified-GRPO三阶段训练：冷启动阶段、生成促进理解阶段、理解促进生成阶段。

Result: 编码器能自主生成更具描述性的标题，解码器能理解复杂描述并实现高保真重建，在统一多模态学习方面取得显著效果。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过重建目标实现多模态理解与生成统一的有效性，为多模态学习提供了新的insight和实用框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的运动建模方法，为3D人体运动恢复提供了更鲁棒和物理合理的解决方案，在多个应用场景中展现出优越性能

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Method: 通过分析最优参数化线性去噪器，理论推导和实验验证像素相关性导致局部性，并基于此构建新的解析去噪器

Result: 证明局部性是图像数据集的统计属性，最优线性去噪器表现出与深度神经网络相似的局部性，新解析去噪器比现有方法更接近深度扩散模型的预测分数

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性源于自然图像数据集的像素相关性统计特性，而非卷积网络的归纳偏置，这一发现有助于构建更准确的解析模型

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured

statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to

Result: 在模拟和真实世界环境中验证，在限制通信设置下任务重复率显著降低，最频繁重分配任务减少52%

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理活动不对称障碍、通信质量差、部分可观测环境下的分布式多机器人协同问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种采用3D纤维缆结构技术(3DFiT)制造轻量化无人机架体的新方法，通过连续单纽纤维构建FCC格子结构，实现了高比强度和稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统复合材料制造方法难以实现复杂的3D结构，并且组装组件存在弱点问题，同时维持连续纤维增强也是一大挑战。

Method: 采用3D纤维缆结构技术(3DFiT)，使用连续单纽纤维构建面心立方(FCC)格子结构无人机架体，确保精确的纤维对齐。

Result: 制造的无人机架体仅重260克，比商用DJI F450架体轻10%，比强度是金属和热塑性材料的4-8倍，飞行时间延长3分钟，验证了其稳定性和耐用性。

Conclusion: 单纽格子架构结构无人机架体具有很大潜力，3DFiT技术作为一种可扩展的高效制造方法。

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KoopMotion是一种基于Koopman算子的运动规划方法，能够从任意初始状态驱动机器人收敛到期望轨迹的终点，具有高样本效率，仅需3%的LASA数据集即可生成密集运动规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子理论在建模动态系统方面表现出色，但它本身不强制收敛到期望轨迹或指定目标，而这是从演示学习(LfD)中的关键要求

Method: 将运动流场表示为动态系统，用Koopman算子参数化来模仿期望轨迹，利用学习流场的发散特性获得平滑运动场，使机器人在偏离期望轨迹时能够收敛并跟踪到终点

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上评估有效，包括频谱分析；在物理机器人(小型自主水面车辆)的非静态流体环境中验证；相比基线方法在空间和时间动态建模效果指标上有显著提升

Conclusion: KoopMotion方法高效且有效，能够生成收敛到期望轨迹的平滑运动场，在样本效率和动态建模性能方面优于现有方法

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR
sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations.
Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene
awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping
performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing
behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning),
a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive
LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model
predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid
architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose
observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned
baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational
constraints. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种能够在动态不确定环境中预测停车位可用性并进行智能规划的有效方法，为自主代客停车系统的实际应用提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a
practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field

Motivation: 当前基于MLLM的具身系统存在两个关键限制：几何适应性差距（2D输入或硬编码3D几何注入导致空间信息不足或泛化能力受限）和具身约束差距（忽视真实机器人的物理约束，导致理论可行但实际不可行的任务规划）。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Conclusion: VLA-Adapter通过先进的桥接范式显著降低了VLA模型的部署门槛，实现了高性能与高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

Abstract: Advancing research in fields like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on reliable and
reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have
driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing
modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying

SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative

Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR

Motivation: 在边缘平台上部署滑动检测系统面临能量限制的挑战，需要开发低功耗的早期滑动检测方案来提升机器人操作安全性

Method: 使用NeuroTac传感器（具有突出乳头状结构的皮肤）和脉冲卷积神经网络（SCNN）进行滑动状态分类，通过传感器运动诱导滑动条件

Result: SCNN模型在三类滑动状态（无滑动、初期滑动、完全滑动）分类中达到94.33%准确率；在动态重力诱导滑动验证条件下，系统在所有试验中都能在完全滑动发生前至少360毫秒检测到初期滑动

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于对象相对控制的新视觉导航方法ObjectReact，通过使用对象级别表征替代传统的图像级别表征，解决了图像相对控制方法在踏径依赖性、跨体验部署等方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的单目标导航方法使用图像级别表征，但图像与代理体姿态和体验绑定，存在限制。而对象作为地图属性，提供了不依赖于体验和轨迹的世界表征，具有更高的不变性和灵活性。

Method: 提出了一种基于"相对3D场景图"的顶层地形地图表征，用于获取更信息丰富的对象级全局路径规划成本。训练了一个直接条件于高级"WayObject Costmap"表征的本地控制器ObjectReact，消除了显式RGB输入的需求。

Result: 在传感器高度变化和多种导航任务中，对象相对控制方法比图像相对方法显示出明显优势，特别是在逆向导航等挑战空间理解能力的任务中。仅使用模拟器训练的策略能够良好地沿用到真实室内环境。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制为单目标导航提供了一种更加灵活、不依赖于体验和具有高不变性的方法，能够在不同体验和轨迹情况下实现跨部署，为视觉导航领域带来了重要进步。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

TL;DR: 开发了能够全身膨胀收缩的机器人MOFU，研究发现膨胀收缩运动能显著增强机器人感知的生命感，是未来机器人设计的重要元素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人主要模仿外观和关节运动，但忽视了生物体中常见的全身膨胀收缩这种体积变化运动对生命感感知的影响

Method: 开发了MOFU机器人，采用Jitterbug结构实现单电机驱动的全身膨胀收缩，并通过在线视频调查使用Godspeed问卷评估不同运动模式对生命感感知的影响

Result: 膨胀收缩运动显著提高感知生命感；双机器人配置未显著增强生命感；膨胀收缩与运动结合比单独运动获得更高生命感评分

Conclusion: 体积变化的膨胀收缩运动是增强机器人生命感感知的重要设计元素，应在未来社交互动机器人开发中予以考虑

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

Motivation: 现有手-物体运动捕捉数据存在精度问题和人-机器人手之间的本体差异，传统三阶段方法（重定向、跟踪、残差校正）导致演示数据利用不足和误差累积

Method: 提出统一单循环优化，联合执行重定向和跟踪；将演示作为软指导而非绝对真值；从原始轨迹推导自适应空间范围；使用强化学习训练策略保持在范围内同时最小化控制努力并完成任务

Result: 统一公式保留了演示意图，使机器人特定策略得以涌现，提高了对噪声的鲁棒性，并能扩展到大规模演示语料库；将规模化跟踪策略蒸馏为基于视觉的技能条件生成控制器

Conclusion: Dexplore作为原则性桥梁，将不完美的演示转化为灵巧操作的有效训练信号，支持跨对象泛化和真实世界部署

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: SimpleVLA-RL是一个针对视觉-语言-动作模型的强化学习框架，通过引入VLA特定的轨迹采样、并行化、多环境渲染和优化损失计算，显著提升了机器人操作的性能和泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 解决VLA模型在大规模人类操作轨迹数据稀缺和成本高昂的问题，以及面对分布偏移时泛化能力有限的两个根本挑战。受到大型推理模型中强化学习提升推理能力的启发，探索RL是否能类似地提升VLA模型的长期动作规划能力。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上达到最先进性能，在RoboTwin 1.0和2.0上甚至超越了π_0基准。不仅减少了对大规模数据的依赖，实现了鲁棒泛化，而且在真实世界任务中显著超越了监督微调方法。

Conclusion: SimpleVLA-RL框架有效解决了VLA模型的数据依赖和泛化问题，通过强化学习显著提升了性能，并发现了RL训练过程中的新现象"pushcut"，表明策略能够发现训练过程中未见的新模式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险应用中的决策提供了更可靠的每个样本不确定性评估，对现有的加性分解方法形成了补充。

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了矩阵乘性权重更新(MMWU)算法的改进版本，在矩阵学习专家建议问题中实现了实例最优的遗憾界，计算复杂度保持不变，并在量子学习理论中有重要应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题中只能达到极小极大最优遗憾界，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持计算效率又能获得更好理论保证的改进算法

Method: 开发了基于势函数的矩阵LEA通用框架，利用拉普拉斯变换技术构建新的单边Jensen迹不等式，通过虚误差函数构造最优势函数

Result: 新算法实现了O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))的实例最优遗憾界，计算复杂度与MMWU相同，在量子态学习等应用中显著优于现有技术

Conclusion: 该工作为矩阵在线学习提供了理论突破，改进的遗憾界是"免费"获得的，在量子信息处理等多个领域具有重要应用价值

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对抗性腐败环境下鲁棒的Q-learning算法，在异步采样模型中实现了与非对抗情况相近的有限时间收敛率，并建立了信息理论下界证明其最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法在面对奖励信号受到对抗性腐败（如极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击）时性能严重下降，需要开发能够有效应对此类腐败的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出了两种鲁棒Q-learning变体：一种需要知道真实奖励分布的统计信息，另一种无需先验知识。后者利用了改进的Azuma-Hoeffding不等式来处理几乎鞅的技术挑战。

Result: 在异步采样模型下，即使存在对抗性腐败，算法的有限时间收敛率与非对抗情况相匹配，仅增加一个与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。信息理论下界证明这个附加项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为异步Q-learning提供了有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习领域的重要空白，所提出的技术工具可能具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Conclusion: 所提框架能够有效处理组内分布不确定性，在噪声和非平稳环境中提升机器学习模型对 underrepresented 群体的性能表现。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Result: 获得了控制归因经验均值收敛到期望的乘法常数，发现LRP-beta的常数与权重范数无关，这与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon形成显著区别

Conclusion: 该分析对多非几何数据增强场景和Smoothgrad型归因方法具有重要意义，揭示了LRP-beta在权重范数独立性方面的独特优势

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳感知客户端选择和调度能有效减少联邦学习碳排放，通过合理利用松弛时间和公平分配策略，可以在碳约束下维持甚至提升模型性能

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

TL;DR: ANNA注意力机制在保持Transformer表达能力的同时实现了亚二次时间复杂度，能够模拟MPC算法并解决关键推理任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer虽然具有模拟大规模并行计算的能力，但其二次时间复杂度严重限制了可扩展性，需要开发更高效的注意力机制

Method: 提出近似最近邻注意力(ANNA)机制，具有亚二次时间复杂度，通过理论证明其在MPC框架下的表达能力

Result: ANNA-transformers保持标准注意力的表达能力，能解决Match2和k-hop等关键推理任务，且常数深度ANNA能模拟常数深度低秩transformers

Conclusion: ANNA提供了一种统一的方式来推理各种高效注意力近似方法，在保持表达能力的同时显著提升计算效率

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

Motivation: 在网络安全和金融等领域，面对大规模表格数据时，无监督异常检测仍是个大挑战。真实数据存在异质上下文，单一全局分布容易忽略上下文细节，影响检测效果。

Method: 提出上下文条件异常检测框架，自动识别上下文特征，使用简单深度自编码器建模条件数据分布。

Result: 在多个表格数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法在异常检测性能上超过了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了考虑上下文信息对准确区分异常和正常实例的重要性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Motivation: 数据驱动气象模型进展平台化，需要新方法突破现有限制，而非重新建模

Method: 使用混合专家框架，通过Vision Transformer基础的间控网络根据预报时效动态学习各专家模型在每个格点的权重

Result: 在2天预报范围内，正常化平方误差(RMSE)比最佳AI气象模型降低10%，显著超过单个专家和简单平均结果

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算效率高、可扩展的策略，能够充分利用现有高质量预报模型来推动数据驱动气象预报技术的发展

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个可扩展的XAI框架，通过RKHS中的正交函数分解避免特征子集枚举，提供功能组件而非单一标量归因，在表格数据上实现高效且高保真的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和将效应总结为单一标量值的表达能力不足问题。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的正交函数分解方法，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现0.6-9.7倍的速度提升（中位数约3倍），保持高保真度(R^2在0.81-0.999之间)和良好的排序一致性，支持局部和全局解释。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充了标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互作用的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Motivation: 解决机器学习中选择泛化能力好模型的挑战，利用Rashomon效应（多个模型性能相近的现象）来构建更鲁棒的集成模型。

Method: Rashomon Ensemble方法：基于模型性能和解释性对高性能模型进行分组，选择覆盖解空间不同区域的模型构建集成，最大化多样性同时保持预测准确性。

Result: 在开放和专有真实数据集上验证，当Rashomon比例较大时，AUROC提升可达0.20+，在多个实际应用中展示了鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble方法通过策略性选择多样化模型，有效提升了模型在分布偏移和未见数据变化下的泛化能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Result: 实验结果表明，Sensitivity-LoRA在多种任务和基准测试中表现出强大的有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA通过动态秩分配机制，显著提升了LoRA方法的性能和实用性，为资源受限环境下的LLM专业化微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于北极海冰预测，还可广泛应用于其他动态高维领域，为因果驱动的预测建模提供了可扩展的方法

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了连续时间多自然强化学习的关键挑战，通过提高价值梯度的保真度来改善价值近似和策略训练的稳定性

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Motivation: ISP之间建立对等互联关系过程复杂耗时，自动化选择对等伙伴能提高全球互联网生态系统的效率

Method: 利用PeeringDB、CAIDA等公开数据，评估树基模型、神经网络和Transformer三类机器学习模型预测对等关系

Result: 树基模型（特别是XGBoost）表现最佳，准确率达98%，对时间、空间变化和缺失数据具有强韧性

Conclusion: ISP可采用该方法实现完全自动化的对等伙伴选择，推动互联网生态系统向更高效优化方向发展

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然英语和中文的合成语音检测器发展迅速，但拥有6亿多使用者的西班牙语在语音取证领域代表性不足，需要专门的检测数据集来应对合成语音滥用的风险。

Method: 构建HISPASpoof数据集，包含来自公开语料库的6种口音真实语音，以及使用6种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音。评估了5种代表性检测方法在西班牙语上的性能。

Result: 在英语上训练的检测器无法有效泛化到西班牙语，而使用HISPASpoof训练能显著提升检测性能。同时评估了合成语音溯源（识别生成方法）的性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进西班牙语可靠和包容性语音取证提供了关键基准，填补了该语言在合成语音检测领域的空白。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

trading agent for USD/TWD by integrating Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM)
for short-term trend prediction with Quantum Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (QA3C), a quantum-enhanced variant of the classical A3C. Trained
on data from 2000-01-01 to 2025-04-30 (80\% training, 20\% testing), the
long-only agent achieves 11.87\% return over around 5 years with 0.92\% max

*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO是一种序列级强化学习方法，通过在重要性采样权重空间实施长度公平裁剪来解决PPO/GRPO方法在序列长度上的不公平问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法在移植PPO/GRPO式裁剪时存在固定裁剪范围对长短回答的系统性重加权问题，扭曲了有效目标。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，使用高斯启发的解决方案：用KL校正漂移项和√L缩放因子对序列对数IS比率进行带裁剪。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间上平整了裁剪率，稳定了训练过程，在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过长度公平的裁剪机制有效解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题，提供了理论保证和实证优势。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现有气象模型评价指标存在"统计相似性陷阱"，奖励模糊预测而错过稀有高影响事件。DART框架通过双解码器结构和物理驱动方法，显著提升极端对流检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习气象模型评价指标存在重大缺陷，导致模型评价偏向平均性能而忽视极端天气事件的准确检测，这对预防高影响强对流天气造成严重影响。

Method: 提出DART双解码器框架，采用明确的背景/极端分解结构、物理驱动的过采样技术和任务特定损失函数，将粗窗天气预报转换为高分辨率卫星亮温场。

Result: DART在极端对流检测上达到CSI=0.273，偏差仅为2.52（基线模型在相同CSI下偏差为6.72），发现移除水气运输量可以提升检测性能270%，并通过2023年8月吉大钢洪水案例进行了实际验证。

Conclusion: DART框架成功解决了现有气象模型评价的"统计相似性陷阱"问题，通过专门为极端天气检测设计的结构和方法，显著提升了对高影响强对流事件的预测能力，为可信人工智能在极端天气预防中的应用探索了新路径。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

TL;DR: 提出IP3O算法，通过自适应激励机制和渐进惩罚策略解决约束强化学习中的边界稳定性问题，在连续控制任务中实现奖励最大化与约束满足的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束强化学习在连续控制环境中面临奖励最大化与约束满足之间的平衡挑战，传统策略优化方法在约束边界附近表现不稳定，导致训练性能不佳。

Method: 提出增量惩罚近端策略优化(IP3O)算法，集成自适应激励机制，在接近约束边界前施加渐进增加的惩罚来稳定训练动态。

Result: 在基准环境上的实证评估表明，IP3O相比最先进的安全RL算法表现出更好的性能，并提供了最坏情况误差的理论保证。

Conclusion: IP3O通过创新的自适应惩罚机制有效解决了约束RL中的训练稳定性问题，为安全关键应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and

TL;DR: Vejde框架结合数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习，为具有丰富结构化状态的决策问题生成归纳策略函数，在未见过的测试实例上表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，需要能够处理不同规模和结构问题的归纳策略函数。

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图并通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态，使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略。

Result: Vejde策略在测试实例上平均泛化效果良好，未见显著得分损失，在未见测试实例上的得分接近实例特定的MLP代理。

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效处理结构化决策问题，具有良好的泛化性能，为复杂决策问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

TL;DR: 提出LDSim方法，通过从大型语言模型蒸馏领域知识和推理能力来提升问答模拟器的性能，在保持高效推理的同时达到更好的预测效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答模拟器方法存在性能与效率的权衡：LLM-free方法推理快但性能次优，LLM-based方法效果好但推理慢且GPU内存消耗高

Method: LDSim（LLM Distillation based Simulator），从LLM蒸馏领域知识和推理能力来辅助预测，提升模拟性能

Result: 在模拟任务和知识追踪任务上都取得了强劲的结果

Conclusion: LDSim方法通过知识蒸馏有效平衡了性能与效率，为教育推荐系统提供了高质量的模拟数据生成方案

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出MMT-FD方法，用于少样本无监督旋转机械故障诊断，仅需1%标注数据即可达到99%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旋转机械故障诊断中标注数据获取困难、成本高，以及不同设备需要单独训练模型缺乏通用性的问题

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能有效提取无标注数据中的故障特征，具有高效率和高泛化性，适用于多种机械设备的故障诊断

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: EMPG通过解耦策略梯度与熵的关系，有效解决了长时任务中的信用分配问题，提高了学习效率和稳定性

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Result: 理论证明MoSE比SWL测试更强大，实验显示优于基线方法，可视化展示了学习到的可解释结构模式

Conclusion: MoSE提供了灵活且可表达的子图表示学习框架，在保持高性能的同时增强了模型的可解释性

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Conclusion: 提出的多项式核方法为HGR相关系数的计算提供了更可靠和实用的解决方案，特别适合现实世界应用场景。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX提供了一种高效、低成本的超参数优化解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of

Result: 发现LLMs生成的反事实解释通常有效但远远不最小，而当要求最小化时又会做出过小修改以致失效，这种有效性-最小化批扭在多个模型和数据集上都一致

Conclusion: 自我生成的反事实解释最好情况下也是无效的解释工具，最坏情况下会提供误导性见解，在高风险场景中部署LLMs必须考虑不可靠自我解释的影响

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合机器学习与地统计学的混合框架KpR，通过空间滞后特征增强ML模型，在土壤属性预测中显著提升精度30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习和地统计学在土壤属性预测中各具优势但方法不同，需要结合两者优势来提升预测性能

Method: KpR框架：使用普通克里金法生成空间滞后特征来丰富机器学习模型的空间上下文信息，采用TabPFN模型进行预测

Result: KpR与TabPFN组合在6个田间数据集上表现出可靠的uncertainty估计和更高精度，相比无空间上下文的ML算法平均R2提升约30%

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN是精准农业中数字土壤制图的鲁棒且通用的建模框架，特别适合小样本量和近端土壤传感数据有限的情况

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了fuser算法和SAC验证框架，用于改进微生物共现网络推断，特别关注跨环境条件下的动态关联分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微生物共现网络推断算法通常只分析单一环境下的静态关联，忽略了微生物群落在不同生态条件下的动态适应过程，且常将不同环境样本混合分析而未充分考虑环境特异性。

Method: 提出Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)框架评估算法性能，开发fuser算法在训练时保留子样本特异性信号的同时跨环境共享相关信息，生成环境特异性预测网络。

Result: fuser在相同环境(Same)下与glmnet等现有算法性能相当，在跨环境(All)场景中显著降低测试误差。

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效处理微生物群落的时空动态变化，为跨环境微生物关联分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Result: 在四个分子数据集上实现SOTA性能，可控性平均提升15.3%，同时保持高有效性和分布保真度

Conclusion: 基于score的建模在离散图生成中具有实际优势，能够实现灵活的多属性分子设计

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Conclusion: AquaCast模型能够有效整合内外源信息，在真实和合成数据集上均表现出优越的预测性能和良好的泛化能力，为城市水动力学预测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Motivation: 现有DPSGD的静态噪声机制影响模型性能，且随着模型参数指数增长，随机优化器的学习效率面临挑战

Method: 结合动态差分隐私（自动梯度裁剪）和随机投影SGD，动态调整效用与隐私的权衡

Result: 在不同目标函数上表现出可证明的次线性收敛率，实验显示在保持隐私的同时显著提高准确性

Conclusion: 动态差分隐私以隐私为代价带来更好效用，随机投影实现更高效的模型学习

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Conclusion: 双重视角方法能够促进实骄客户端的自然相似性，同时检测可疑的统一性作为攻击指标，显著提高了聚合学习的安全性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Conclusion: 该框架通过同时提升节点区分性和确保几何一致性，成功解决了图对齐中的关键挑战，并且具有良好的领域渣透性。

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis

Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中的公平性问题，在保持性能的同时减少对保护子组的伤害并实现公平决策支持。

Method: 使用可行性引导的公平自适应强化学习方法，校准每个子组的安全阈值，基于医疗补助人群健康管理项目的去标识化纵向轨迹数据进行评估。

Result: FG-FARL在保持与基线方法（行为克隆和HACO）相当的性能价值的同时，显著改善了公平性指标，并通过bootstrap 95%置信区间和p值验证了统计显著性。

Conclusion: FG-FARL提供了一种实用的方法来实现更安全、更公平的决策支持系统，在医疗健康管理等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant是一种针对2位量化的自适应旋转方法，通过可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定Hadamard矩阵，有效抑制激活值异常值，在LLaMA-2-7B上显著降低困惑度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转方法使用固定变换无法适应不同Transformer层的特定异常值模式，需要层自适应的旋转方法

Method: 使用可学习的蝴蝶变换参数化连续Givens旋转角度，保证正交性同时实现平滑优化，并引入均匀性正则化

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B的2位量化中，困惑度从QuaRot的22.1降至15.4，仅需128个校准样本和单GPU几分钟训练

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过自适应旋转有效解决了极端量化中的异常值问题，以可忽略的一次性成本显著提升性能

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.
