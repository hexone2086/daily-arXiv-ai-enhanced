Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and twin networks (Siamese networks),
which have played a pivotal role in improving the accuracy of covering face
recognition. The paper discusses the most prominent challenges, which include
changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and
increasing security threats. Finally, the paper focuses on future research

### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种用于图像识别模型数据集所有权验证的新方法，通过选择性修改少量困难样本嵌入不可察觉的验证痕迹，实现高效验证同时保持数据完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于图像数据集常包含敏感或专有内容，数据所有者需要可靠机制验证其数据是否被未经授权用于训练第三方模型。现有方法在验证效果和数据完整性之间存在权衡。

Method: HoneyImage选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹，以验证数据集所有权。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多种模型架构上的实验表明，HoneyImage在保持数据完整性和不可察觉性的同时，实现了高验证准确性。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用的机制，保护图像数据集所有权，促进安全共享并释放数据驱动AI的潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种基于扩散框架的单阶段生成模型，用于同时合成显微结构图像和分割掩码，显著提高了分割精度，尤其在少数类别上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金属合金显微结构分割中因缺乏人工标注掩码（尤其是稀有或复杂形态）而导致的机器学习效果受限问题。

Method: 提出PF-DiffSeg，一种基于全局相分数控制的单阶段去噪扩散框架，联合生成图像和掩码，并通过增强少数类别的数据分布来提高多样性。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，该方法在分割精度（尤其是少数类别）和推理时间上优于传统方法和两阶段基线模型。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg为金属学应用提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案，将生成与条件化整合为统一框架。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

*Jose M. Sánchez Velázquez,Mingbo Cai,Andrew Coney,Álvaro J. García- Tejedor,Alberto Nogales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了混合深度学习方法在视频帧预测中的应用，结合了自编码器和RNN、3D CNN等架构，提升了预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频帧预测在天气预报和自动驾驶等领域有重要应用，但现有方法仍有改进空间。

Method: 结合自编码器的特征提取能力和RNN、3D CNN等时序建模方法，提出混合模型。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，SSIM指标从0.69提升到0.82，3D CNN和ConvLSTM表现最佳，灰度视频预测效果最好。

Conclusion: 混合模型显著提升了视频帧预测性能，尤其在灰度视频和真实数据上表现突出。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一个针对事件数据的自监督预训练框架，专注于学习时空信息，特别适合循环模型，并在下游任务中取得领先结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法忽略事件数据的长期时间信息，导致循环模型在预训练中表现不佳。

Method: 提出TESPEC框架，采用掩码图像建模范式，设计新重建目标，将事件累积为伪灰度视频。

Result: 在物体检测、语义分割和单目深度估计等任务中取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: TESPEC通过利用长期事件序列，显著提升了循环模型在自监督预训练中的表现。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法医图像质量低下导致的人脸识别性能下降问题。

Method: 使用Flux.1 Kontext Dev流程和Facezoom LoRA适配，测试了七种退化类型。

Result: 识别准确率从29.1%提升至84.5%，效果显著。

Conclusion: 扩散增强技术对法医人脸识别具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

TL;DR: 提出CCRA方法，通过LPWCA和PAI协调多模态注意力机制，提升视觉语言模型的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中注意力机制不协调导致的嵌入学习效果不佳问题。

Method: 引入LPWCA捕获细粒度区域语义关联，结合PAI系统协调多层注意力机制。

Result: 在10个基准测试中达到最优性能，仅增加3.55M参数。

Conclusion: CCRA显著提升模型性能，同时增强注意力的区域聚焦和语义对齐。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Result: 结果表明，少量手动数据微调即可显著提升网络性能。

Conclusion: 自动标注与少量手动标注结合的方法可加速深度学习网络在新场景（如从跑步机到自行车）中的适应。

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

*Cihang Peng,Qiming Hou,Zhong Ren,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI是一个高质量合成数据集，用于实例接地的文本到图像生成，通过重新标注策略提升检测效果。


<details>

Result: ROVI在图像质量、分辨率和类别数量上优于现有数据集，且训练模型表现更优。

Conclusion: ROVI为文本到图像生成提供了高质量数据支持，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at
https://github.com/CihangPeng/ROVI.

*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSIGHT利用眼动追踪数据自动评估人类在视觉任务中的专业水平，通过5秒评估窗口实现0.751的AUROC，30秒窗口提升至0.8306。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过眼动追踪数据自动区分专家与非专家，以优化人机协作中的动态专业评估。

Method: 基于眼动追踪数据的特征集成方法AutoSIGHT，用于分类专家与非专家。

Result: 5秒评估窗口AUROC为0.751，30秒窗口提升至0.8306。

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT为动态人机协作中的专业评估提供了可行方案，并公开了相关眼动追踪数据。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增量式SfM方法，用于从非结构化图像集合中实现精确的3D重建，适用于稀疏或部分重叠数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局SfM技术对噪声或缺失数据敏感，而增量式SfM更具灵活性，能逐步整合新视图以恢复场景结构和相机运动。

Method: 详细实现了增量式SfM流程，重点研究几何估计的一致性和通过束调整的迭代优化效果。

Result: 通过真实数据集验证，评估了重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性，证明了增量式SfM在视觉结构化环境中的实用性。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是一种可靠的方法，适用于稀疏3D重建。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图的新方法，用于3D CT扫描的多标签分类，解决了现有方法在长程依赖建模和高计算成本方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查数量的增加，需要自动化方法辅助放射科医生管理日益增长的工作量，但现有方法在复杂空间关系和长程依赖建模上存在局限。

Method: 将CT扫描建模为结构化图，利用轴向切片三元组节点通过谱域卷积处理，提升多标签异常分类性能。

Result: 方法表现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力和竞争性性能，同时对z轴平移具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的图方法在多标签分类任务中表现优异，且通过消融研究验证了各组件的贡献。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的规避框架，通过教师模型学习版权数据集，并利用OOD数据集将任务相关但标识无关的知识转移给学生模型，显著提升了规避效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证（DOV）方法在评估中依赖过于简化的规避攻击，导致虚假的安全感。本文旨在揭示当前DOV方法的漏洞，并提出更有效的规避策略。

Method: 使用教师模型学习版权数据集，通过OOD数据集转移任务相关但标识无关的知识给学生模型，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型优化转移集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能消除所有版权标识，并在泛化性和规避效果上显著优于九种现有攻击方法，计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 当前DOV方法存在关键漏洞，需要长期发展以提高实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COSTARR提出了一种新的衰减假设，通过结合熟悉特征的缺失和陌生特征的衰减信息，显著提升了开放集识别（OSR）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉特征假设，忽略了衰减特征的作用。COSTARR旨在利用这些被忽视的信息。

Method: COSTARR结合了熟悉特征和陌生特征的衰减信息，通过概率解释其评分，并进行消融实验验证各特征的作用。

Result: COSTARR在多种预训练架构（ViTs、ConvNeXts、ResNet）上表现优异，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，显著提升了开放集识别的能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Trans-Adapter，一种即插即用的适配器，使基于扩散的图像修复模型能直接处理透明图像，解决传统方法中透明边缘不一致和锯齿问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅支持RGB图像，处理RGBA图像时需两阶段流程（修复+抠图），导致透明边缘不一致和锯齿问题。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter适配器，支持直接处理透明图像，并兼容ControlNet实现可控编辑。

Result: 实验表明Trans-Adapter在透明边缘质量上表现优异，并引入LayerBench和新评估指标验证效果。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter为透明图像修复提供了高效、可控的解决方案。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的材料先验，限制了处理未知材料的能力，因此需要一种材料无关的系统识别方法。

Method: MASIV采用可学习的神经本构模型，并通过重建连续粒子轨迹提供密集几何指导，以解决优化不稳定和物理不合理行为的问题。

Result: 实验表明，MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MASIV通过材料无关的方法和密集几何指导，显著提升了系统识别的性能。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Result: EARL模型在多种编辑任务中表现优异，且训练数据需求较少。

Conclusion: EARL推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑领域的进展，并开源了代码和数据。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Result: UniEgoMotion在运动重建和生成方面表现优异，首次实现单张第一人称图像生成运动。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为第一人称运动建模设定了新标准，拓展了应用可能性。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Motivation: 开发一个领域无关的异常检测方法，以应对脑MRI数据中的挑战，如数据规模大、过拟合和类别不平衡。

Method: 结合深度强化学习与特征表示，处理标签稀缺、大规模数据和过拟合问题，使用公开的脑MRI数据集进行训练和测试。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上，AUROC达到88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级），优于现有方法；在工业数据集上表现同样出色。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适用于临床和工业应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在性能和保真度之间存在权衡，且存在图像级选择效率低和像素级优化语义失真的问题。研究发现颜色的双重角色（信息载体和语义单元）被忽视，提升颜色丰富度有助于表示学习。

Method: 提出DC3框架，结合校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型，增强图像颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且首次利用预训练扩散模型微调压缩数据集，FID结果证明其高质量数据集可行。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿显著提升数据集压缩的性能和保真度，为下游任务提供了高质量数据集。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Result: 在3D mIoU上比固定阈值策略提升17%，并在场景重建和交互中表现优异。

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion在3D对象理解和语言引导场景交互中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制采用统一标准，忽视了用户因年龄、心理健康和个人信仰等因素形成的多样化安全边界。

Method: PSA框架将个性化用户配置文件集成到扩散过程中，通过交叉注意力机制调整模型行为。

Result: 实验表明，PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面优于现有方法，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA框架有效实现了用户特定安全控制，同时保持图像质量，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化需求上的不足。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型，结合语言控制分割策略（LS）和窗口控制细化策略（WR），通过模式切换器协调。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，Fβω增益最高达4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在二分图像分割中表现出色，适用于高精度和个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

Motivation: 解决场景文本识别（STR）中因复杂视觉外观和有限语义先验带来的挑战。

Method: 将真实文本作为辅助输入编码到嵌入空间，并通过损失感知掩码模拟课程学习过程。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，TEACH显著提高了模型准确性，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: TEACH无需外部预训练，无推理开销，具有鲁棒性和通用性，可轻松集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了计算效率，适用于密集长期3D点跟踪任务。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对姿态估计中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的免姿态训练和高效设计使其在实际应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Conclusion: 通过联合建模和阶段式推理，该方法显著提升了3D功能区域理解的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，GroundingOcc优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 3D占用接地任务和GroundingOcc模型为自动驾驶提供了更精确的对象感知能力。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent

infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

*Tianze Wang,Zhang Zhang,Chao Yue,Nuoran Li,Chao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RoadMamba的新方法，结合局部和全局感知技术，用于道路表面分类任务，通过DualSSM和DAF模块提升性能，并在大规模数据集上取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉技术提前获取道路表面条件对自动驾驶车辆的规划和控制系统至关重要，但现有Mamba架构在局部纹理提取方面表现不足，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出RoadMamba方法，利用DualSSM提取全局语义和局部纹理，通过DAF模块解码和融合双特征，并引入双辅助损失约束网络。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模道路表面分类数据集上，RoadMamba实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合局部和全局感知，显著提升了道路表面分类的准确性，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的信息。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

*Yuanlin Yang,Quanjian Song,Zhexian Gao,Ge Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaoyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco提出了一种无监督框架，通过针对风格迁移任务学习文本表示，解决了扩散模型在风格迁移中的语义局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在风格迁移中因将文本描述视为统一指导而忽略了语义与视觉风格的差距，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 框架包括Prior-Guided Data Distillation（PGD）和Contrastive Semantic Decoupling（CSD），前者无监督蒸馏风格知识，后者通过域特定权重调整文本编码器。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留方面优于现有方法，并支持去风格化。

Conclusion: StyDeco有效解决了风格迁移中的语义问题，展示了其扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

*Bolei Chen,Shengsheng Yan,Yongzheng Cui,Jiaxu Kang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用视觉场景上下文信息增强楼层平面定位（FLoc）的方法，通过无监督学习和聚类约束预训练房间判别器，显著提高了定位的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FLoc方法依赖2D结构匹配或3D几何约束，忽略了视觉图像提供的丰富上下文信息，导致定位模糊。本文旨在利用场景布局先验消除不确定性。

Method: 提出无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏的房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法以利用场景上下文。

Result: 在两个标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入场景上下文信息，该方法有效解决了FLoc中的模糊性问题，为视觉定位提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

TL;DR: MoGaFace提出了一种新的3D头部虚拟形象建模框架，通过动态优化几何和纹理属性，解决了传统方法中网格与目标图像不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖FLAME网格和基于高斯的渲染，但网格与图像不对齐会导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Method: MoGaFace引入动量引导的几何一致性模块和潜在纹理注意力机制，动态优化几何和纹理。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在高保真头部虚拟形象重建和新视角合成质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: MoGaFace在网格初始化不准确和真实场景下仍能显著提升重建质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

TL;DR: ENN是一种新型神经网络架构，通过重新参数化权重为共享的正交特征基，解决了传统DNN权重结构混乱的问题，提升了特征表示和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN的梯度优化导致权重结构混乱，影响特征清晰度和学习动态，ENN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ENN通过层共享的正交特征基重新参数化权重，强制权重动态解耦和对齐，无需正则化。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优异，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新纪录。其变体ENN-ℓ实现了无反向传播的局部学习，训练速度提升2倍以上，且精度更高。

Conclusion: ENN通过改进权重表示，提升了性能并实现了高效并行训练，为神经网络架构提供了新范式。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Result: 在多个数据集上，ParaRevSNN性能与标准RevSNNs相当或更优，训练时间减少35.2%，推理时间降至18.15%。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多缓存增强的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP），通过三个缓存优化原型构建，提升未知测试分布下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的测试时间适应方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但在分布偏移下可能不可靠，且无法保证类内紧凑性。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含熵缓存、对齐缓存和负缓存，分别用于初始化原型、整合视觉与文本信息以及校准预测。进一步提出MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MCP和MCP++通过优化原型构建和跨模态对齐，显著提升了测试时间适应的性能。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图学习模型因假设类别完整性而在开放集场景中表现不佳，且视图诱导的静态偏差进一步削弱了识别未知类别的能力。

Method: 设计了O-Mix合成策略生成虚拟样本，并引入辅助模糊感知网络和基于HSIC的对比去偏模块。

Result: 在多个多视图基准测试中，该框架显著提升了未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模糊不确定性校准和视图去偏，有效提升了多视图开放集学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过图像描述减少视觉信息损失，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了广泛应用，现有方法在高剪枝率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包括轻量级描述模型和选择器，通过自监督学习生成问题相关描述并选择最佳描述。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低的FLOPs显著优于现有方法（如超越SOTA 20.6%，FLOPs减少6.5%）。

Conclusion: ACCM能有效减少视觉信息损失，提升模型效率。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Result: 实验表明OCSplats在不同复杂场景中均实现领先的重建性能和精确噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats为抗噪3D重建提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Result: 在包含40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，NS-Net检测准确率提升7.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS-Net在GAN和扩散模型生成的图像检测中表现出强泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上的实验表明，DisFaceRep显著优于现有弱监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: DisFaceRep有效解决了弱监督面部解析的挑战，为减少标注成本提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

Result: 在六个主流数据集上显著优于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型性能甚至超过基于更大ViT-L/14的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调，成功提升了图像聚类的性能，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS)方法，通过对抗损失引导扩散模型生成多样化的蒸馏数据集，解决了信息冗余问题，并在实验中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像分辨率和每类图像数量增加，数据集蒸馏面临性能下降问题，且扩散模型生成的图像多样性不足导致信息冗余。

Method: 提出ACS方法，将蒸馏数据集分为多个课程，通过对抗损失引导扩散采样过程，减少课程间信息重叠，并逐步生成从简单到复杂的图像。

Result: 在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别实现了4.1%和2.1%的性能提升。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗引导和课程采样，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对点云分类模型在噪声环境下鲁棒性和校准性的评估，因此需要新的基准测试。

Method: 通过高斯噪声参数（σ, μ）生成噪声污染点云和点级不确定性注释，评估PointNet、DGCNN和Point Transformer v3的分类准确性、校准指标和不确定性感知能力。

Result: 所有模型在噪声增加时性能下降，但Point Transformer v3表现出更好的校准性，其预测的不确定性与底层测量不确定性更一致。

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为点云分类模型的鲁棒性和校准性提供了新的评估工具，Point Transformer v3在噪声环境下表现最佳。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SGCap的零样本视频字幕方法，通过语义组解码和多样句子选择模块，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本图像字幕方法直接扩展到视频领域效果不佳，因其忽略了时间动态性。

Method: 采用语义组解码（SGD）策略建模帧间时间关系，并引入关键句子选择（KSS）和概率采样监督（PSS）模块增强视频级监督。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SGCap显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至与全监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态性和多样句子监督，提升了零样本视频字幕的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一个基于门控提示调优的框架，用于防止文本到图像模型生成不安全内容，同时保持良性图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法依赖大规模数据集且静态防御，导致高计算成本、图像质量下降和适应性不足。

Method: 通过LLM重写不安全提示为安全文本，训练通用软提示，并结合门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: PromptSafe在多个基准测试中实现了最低的不安全生成率（2.36%），同时保持了高良性保真度。

Conclusion: PromptSafe具有强泛化能力、跨模型可迁移性和对抗攻击鲁棒性，适合安全且可扩展的部署。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准测试中，该方法在所有无监督立体匹配方法中达到了最优的匹配精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效利用3D几何知识和减少噪声，显著提升了无监督立体匹配的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，能有效提升模型对域差异的鲁棒性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优异，AUROC分别达到66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架在多类3D异常检测中表现出色，并能持续适应新类别。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Conclusion: CSINet通过跨视图语义交互和协同注意力机制，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的尺度变化和目标模糊问题。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Conclusion: StyleSentinel为艺术作品版权保护提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过引入外部语义监督和对比性块一致性模块，成功弥补弱监督与精细定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

quantization. The results validate its effectiveness for real-time road
condition perception in intelligent suspension systems.

Motivation: 机器人辅助手术需要实时场景理解，但传统静态数据集训练的模型在动态手术环境中表现不佳。类增量语义分割（CISS）可以持续适应新类别，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 基于TOPICS方法，提出TOPICS+，引入Dice损失处理类别不平衡，设计分层伪标签和手术专用标签分类体系。

Result: 提出了六个新的CISS基准测试和144类以上的精细标签集，并在Syn-Mediverse数据集上验证。

Conclusion: TOPICS+在手术场景中表现优异，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RandSF.Q的新方法，通过结合当前帧和下一帧特征，改进了视频对象中心学习的查询预测能力，显著提升了对象发现和动态建模的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频对象中心学习方法忽略了下一帧特征的重要性，且未能有效学习过渡动态知识，导致查询预测能力不足。

Method: 设计了新的过渡器（transitioner），结合槽位（slots）和特征（features），并通过随机采样槽位-特征对训练过渡器，以学习过渡动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对象发现任务上提升了10个百分点，并在动态建模等下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: RandSF.Q通过改进查询预测机制，显著提升了视频对象中心学习的性能，为相关任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion框架有效提升了场景理解和任务性能，地图扩散模块可扩展至其他方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: FWA和LOLViT有效解决了计算效率不平衡问题，显著提升了轻量级混合模型的性能。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Motivation: 随着机器人探索任务的复杂性增加，高质量数字地形图（DTM）的需求日益增长，但传统方法依赖繁琐的手动预处理。

Method: 采用神经体积渲染技术，仅需图像像素的轨迹信息，无需深度或其他结构先验。

Result: 在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上验证，预测精度接近卫星图像分辨率，即使相机参数不完美。

Conclusion: NTM方法在生成高质量地形图方面表现出潜力，优于传统多视图立体管道。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Conclusion: ESI显著提升了无人机在恶劣视觉环境下的感知能力，适用于实时视觉跟踪任务。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Method: 提出OAPR任务，设计学习通用身体部位表示的框架，重构四个数据集支持开放属性识别。

Result: 实验验证了OAPR任务的必要性及框架的有效性。

Conclusion: OAPR任务和提出的框架为开放属性识别提供了有效解决方案，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法结合雷达和摄像头数据，有效解决了非视距行人定位问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间和频率域的RAW图像目标检测增强框架SFAE，通过频带空间化和跨域融合注意力模块提升细节恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW数据的宽动态范围和线性响应会抑制关键目标细节，现有方法难以在空间域有效恢复这些细节。

Method: 提出SFAE框架，包括频带空间化、跨域融合注意力模块和自适应非线性调整。

Result: 通过频域和空间域协同，有效恢复被抑制的细节，提升目标检测性能。

Conclusion: SFAE框架在RAW图像目标检测中表现出色，为频域和空间域融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Motivation: 解决全景RGB-D传感器在现实部署中成本高或难以获取的问题，同时提升单目输入导航的性能。

Method: 提出UNR联合对齐视觉语义和语言动作意图，并引入LPD任务通过单目输入预测全景RGB-D的潜在特征。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，缩小了与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream通过UNR和LPD任务，为单目导航提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Conclusion: ForenX通过结合MLLMs和人类标注数据，显著提升了AI生成图像的检测和解释能力。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Conclusion: 该模型实现了高光谱图像全局、局部和非局部先验的统一表示，具有强适用性和优异的恢复效果。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced

Conclusion: MiraGe通过生成器不变特征学习和多模态提示学习，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in

However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than

adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile

Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性之间难以平衡，尤其是处理复杂视频内容时。

Method: 采用分层查询分解预过滤无关帧，轻量级VLM评分，全局统计分布优化检索策略，多视角问答方案增强信息提取。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，E-VRAG减少约70%计算成本且准确性更高。

Conclusion: E-VRAG无需额外训练即可显著提升视频RAG任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Result: 剪枝92.6%视觉令牌，保持基线性能；增强版GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基线110%。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新途径。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

*Kun Ding,Ying Wang,Shiming Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于进化算法的自动搜索方法（EvoVLMA），用于优化预训练视觉语言模型的适配算法，无需人工设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型适配方法依赖人工设计，耗时且需经验，希望利用大语言模型（LLM）自动生成高效适配算法。

Method: 采用两阶段LLM辅助进化算法，分阶段优化特征选择和逻辑计算，结合低精度代码转换和在线执行提升搜索效率。

Result: 在8-shot图像分类任务中，EvoVLMA发现的算法比人工设计的APE算法准确率提升1.91%。

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型的适配算法自动化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

*Sara Shoouri,Morteza Tavakoli Taba,Hun-Seok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史感知的自适应扫描框架，通过预测感兴趣区域（ROI）减少LiDAR冗余扫描，显著降低能耗并保持3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在密集扫描时忽略时间连续性，导致冗余和能耗问题，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。

Method: 采用轻量级预测网络和可微分掩码生成器，利用历史时空上下文预测ROI，通过Gumbel-Softmax采样生成二进制掩码指导稀疏扫描。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，LiDAR能耗降低65%以上，同时3D物体检测性能与传统方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了LiDAR冗余扫描问题，为资源受限平台提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

TL;DR: 本文提出LetheViT，一种针对Vision Transformers（ViTs）的对比性遗忘方法，解决隐私法规下数据遗忘的挑战，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户数据及其对模型的影响需完全删除，而ViTs在随机数据遗忘场景中面临挑战。

Method: 通过选择性掩蔽实验揭示ViTs特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩蔽图像生成正对数，原始图像生成负对数，实现特定数据遗忘。

Result: LetheViT在隐私合规与模型效能间取得平衡，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViTs提供了一种高效的数据遗忘解决方案，满足隐私法规需求。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TopoImages的新方法，通过编码图像局部拓扑结构来增强深度学习框架对拓扑特征的敏感性，显著提升了医学图像分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在图像处理中缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，而拓扑结构（如连通性和环路）对理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像局部拓扑特征，生成多通道的TopoImages表示，并结合多视角TopoImages与原始图像进行深度学习分类。

Result: 在三个公开医学图像分类数据集上，TopoImages方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法具有高度通用性，可无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，为数据分析和分类提供了新视角。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SECA的统一框架，利用文本先验的防遗忘和结构化特性，指导语义感知的知识传递，并通过语义增强的视觉原型优化模块提升视觉分类器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）的目标是让模型能够从任务流中学习而不遗忘先前知识。尽管视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在CL中表现出潜力，但其丰富的文本语义先验在解决稳定性-可塑性困境中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 论文提出了SECA框架，包含两个模块：SG-AKT（通过文本线索评估新图像与历史视觉知识的相关性，并以实例自适应方式聚合相关知识）和SE-VPR（利用类间语义关系优化视觉原型）。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA框架通过结合文本和视觉模态的优势，有效解决了持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性平衡问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DG假设目标域在训练时不可访问，但VFMs的出现使这一假设过时。SPL旨在更适应当前研究和应用需求。

Method: SPL通过动态适应和VFM为中心的调优，提出Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning方法，结合动态类感知提示器和提示引导的特征聚焦器。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在广义分割任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SPL为领域迁移任务提供了更灵活和有效的解决方案，特别适用于动态现实场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在随机人体运动预测中难以学习连续时间动态且易发生模式崩溃，忽视了复杂运动的灵活性。

Method: STCN分为两阶段：第一阶段通过时空连续网络生成平滑运动序列并引入锚点集；第二阶段利用锚点集学习GMM分布，并通过多序列采样减少类内差异。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上，STCN在多样性和准确性上均表现出色。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集策略，有效解决了随机人体运动预测中的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Motivation: 解决传统基于回放的方法因存储历史样本引发的隐私问题，以及无样本方法因遗忘过去知识导致的性能下降。

Method: 将序列数据信息浓缩到像素空间，生成代表性样本，并通过双重对齐策略缓解领域偏移和遗忘问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pr^2R比现有方法在顺序任务上准确率提升4%和6%。

Conclusion: Pr^2R在保护隐私的同时显著提升了终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练特征，SNARM通过动态比较测试图像内部参考提升异常检测能力。

Method: 计算测试图像与训练特征的残差，利用高正常性区域生成自参考，结合Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在MVTec AD等基准测试中，SNARM实现了SOTA性能，各项指标显著提升。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自参考学习和动态残差优化，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器架构有效提升了多模态跟踪性能，具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Conclusion: CLIMD为提升多模态疾病诊断准确性提供了有效途径，且具有通用性。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集（如EBRAINS和TCGA）上，FG-PAN实现了零样本脑肿瘤亚型分类的最先进性能。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过视觉与语义特征的对齐，显著提升了细粒度分类的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL通过自适应调整输入图像的提示，显著提升了检测性能，适用于多样化伪造图像。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Method: 方法是通过IMAGEO-Bench基准测试，使用三个多样化数据集（全球街景、美国POIs和未公开图像）评估10种LLMs的准确性、距离误差、地理偏见和推理过程。

Result: 结果显示闭源模型表现更优，但存在地理偏见（在高资源地区表现更好）。成功的地理定位依赖于识别城市环境、户外场景、街景图像和地标。

Conclusion: 结论是IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严格评估，并为未来地理定位感知AI系统的开发提供了启示。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Motivation: 填补生物医学领域中掩码扩散模型应用的空白，提升视觉语言模型的性能。

Method: 采用视觉指令调优的扩散模型LLaDA-MedV，优化初始化权重选择和微调策略。

Result: 在开放任务中性能提升7.855%（对比LLaVA-Med）和1.867%（对比LLaDA-V），在三个VQA基准测试中达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV通过控制响应长度生成更丰富的信息，展示了扩散模型在生物医学领域的潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

*Wanhao Ma,Wei Zhang,Shuai Wan,Fuzheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度学习与G-PCC标准的新预处理框架，显著提升了压缩效率，同时保持兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-PCC标准虽然通用且低功耗，但性能不及深度学习方法，需提升效率而不牺牲其优势。

Method: 集成压缩导向的体素化网络与可微G-PCC替代模型，联合优化训练。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低38.84%，显著提升压缩效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为增强传统压缩标准提供了实用路径，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决玻璃表面分割中RGB和深度信息融合的挑战，如透明、反射和遮挡问题。

Method: 提出动态自适应的WFF模块，可无缝集成到多种深度神经网络中，并引入MJU-Glass数据集作为基准。

Result: 实验表明WFF模块显著提升分割性能，mIoU和bIoU均有改进，尤其是与PSPNet结合时bIoU提升7.49%。

Conclusion: WFF模块和MJU-Glass数据集为机器人领域的玻璃分割提供了鲁棒框架，降低了碰撞风险。

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CDSR的双尺度重建框架，通过选择性采样和局部到全局网络，仅需少量高分辨率补丁即可实现高效的WSI分析，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法在特征提取阶段存在领域差距和次优表示问题，且SSL方法因分割组织学结构导致冗余和依赖补丁，影响性能和效率。

Method: 提出CDSR框架，采用两阶段选择性采样策略和局部到全局网络，重建高分辨率WSI表示。

Result: 在Camelyon16等数据集上，CDSR仅需平均9个高分辨率补丁，分类准确率和AUC分别提升6.3%和5.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CDSR在效率和形态保真度上优于现有方法，为WSI分析提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Motivation: 现有基于文本或图像的扩散模型在头发丝生成中缺乏精确性和用户友好性，草图输入能提供更精细的控制。

Method: 采用可学习的丝状上采样策略将3D头发丝编码到多尺度潜在空间，并使用带扩散头的Transformer实现多尺度自适应条件机制。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该方法在真实感和精确度上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Motivation: 现有方法通过学习演示图像预测3D物体的可供性区域，但泛化能力不足。扩散模型生成的图像显示其内部表示与真实世界可供性概念高度相关，因此被用于提取通用可供性知识。

Method: 提出DAG框架，利用冻结的文本到图像扩散模型内部表示，结合可供性块和多源可供性解码器，实现3D密集可供性预测。

Result: 实验表明，DAG模型优于现有方法，并展现出开放世界的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAG通过扩散模型的内部表示成功提取了通用可供性知识，为3D可供性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Result: 在POPE、MME和MMHal-Bench等基准测试中显著提升了模型的真实性和性能。

Conclusion: 地图级解码策略在减少LVLM幻觉方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

TL;DR: VELA是一种基于速度驱动的水平集方法，用于从点提示中实现端到端的模态分割，通过显式轮廓演化生成完整的物体形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），成本高且不实用；同时缺乏几何解释性，难以推断遮挡形状。

Method: VELA通过点提示构建初始水平集函数，并利用形状特异性运动场逐步演化轮廓，实现几何基础和拓扑灵活的建模。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准测试中，VELA仅需单点提示即优于现有强提示方法。

Conclusion: VELA通过可解释的几何建模，在弱提示下实现了高效且通用的模态分割。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现有的一体化方法在处理多样化的模态形状时表现不佳，因为单一模型难以捕捉和推理复杂的形状变化。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了ShapeMoE框架。

Method: ShapeMoE通过学习潜在形状分布空间，将每个对象编码为紧凑的高斯嵌入，并通过形状感知稀疏路由器动态路由到最适合的轻量级专家模型。每个专家专注于特定形状模式的遮挡区域预测。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上的实验表明，ShapeMoE在遮挡区域分割方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状特定的专家路由和轻量级设计，在模态分割任务中实现了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Motivation: VFMs在语义分割中的应用受限于数据规模差异和领域分布偏移，Rein++旨在克服这些挑战。

Method: Rein++包含Rein-G（域泛化）和Rein-A（域适应）。Rein-G通过实例感知令牌优化特征，Rein-A在实例和逻辑层面进行无监督域适应，并利用SAM增强边界细节。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一种高效、泛化性强且适应性强的VFM分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

Motivation: 对抗补丁攻击威胁现代视觉模型的可靠性，需要系统研究补丁放置的影响以提升防御能力。

Method: 提出PatchMap基准，并通过简单的分割引导放置启发式方法，利用现成掩码识别易受攻击区域，无需梯度查询。

Result: 在五种架构（包括对抗训练的ResNet50）上，该方法比随机或固定放置的攻击成功率提高了8到13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap及其代码公开，未来将发布完整基准（6.5B预测）以加速位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因多模态信息对齐困难导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL性能提升（POPE准确率提高4.1%），而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法对某些VLMs有效，但需考虑模型视觉编码器的适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现出色，但扩展到3D编辑时面临多视角一致性挑战，现有方法存在收敛慢、模糊和细粒度不一致等问题。

Method: DisCo3D通过多视角输入微调3D生成器进行场景适应，再通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后通过高斯泼溅优化多视角输出为3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo3D在多视角一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D有效解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题，提升了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing

*Shiqi Huang,Tingfa Xu,Wen Yan,Dean Barratt,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PromptReg方法，通过直接搜索对应提示简化区域对应表示，无需训练，利用预训练分割模型（如SAM）实现图像配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统区域对应表示需两步（分割ROI后匹配），效率低。本文旨在简化为一直接搜索对应提示的步骤，提高效率。

Method: 1. 提出“对应提示问题”；2. 设计“逆向提示”解决方案；3. 提出新配准算法，通过边缘化提示和空间维度识别多对ROI。

Result: 在5种应用（3D前列腺MR、腹部MR、肺CT、2D病理及航拍图像）中表现优于传统强度迭代算法和学习型DDF预测网络，接近需全标注数据的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: PromptReg方法高效且无需训练，在多种图像配准任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

TL;DR: VTG是一个多功能过渡视频生成框架，通过插值初始化和双向运动微调等方法，生成平滑、高保真且语义连贯的视频过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在视频生成中表现优异，但基于首尾帧和文本提示生成平滑过渡视频的研究较少。

Method: VTG采用插值初始化、双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化，优化预训练图像到视频扩散模型的运动平滑性和生成保真度。

Result: VTG在TransitBench基准测试中表现优异，覆盖概念混合和场景过渡任务。

Conclusion: VTG为统一过渡生成研究提供了高效框架，实验证明其在多种任务中表现一致优越。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

TL;DR: TimeExpert是一种基于Mixture-of-Experts的视频大语言模型，通过动态路由任务特定令牌到专门专家，提升视频时间定位任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型对所有任务令牌采用相同静态处理路径，无法区分时间定位、显著性评估和文本生成等不同任务。

Method: 提出TimeExpert，采用MoE架构动态路由任务特定令牌（如时间戳、显著性分数）到专门专家处理。

Result: 实验表明TimeExpert在密集视频描述、时刻检索和视频高光检测等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过任务分解和动态路由，显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LT-Gaussian是一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3D-GS）的地图更新方法，通过多模态高斯泼溅、结构变化检测模块和高斯地图更新模块，有效且高效地更新自动驾驶场景中的地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D-GS生成高斯场景的时间和计算成本高，地图更新成为自动驾驶系统中的重要挑战。

Method: LT-Gaussian包含三个主要组件：多模态高斯泼溅生成旧场景的高斯地图，通过LiDAR数据流检测结构变化，并针对性更新高斯地图。

Result: 实验表明，LT-Gaussian能高效更新地图，处理常见环境变化，且比从头重建地图的策略提供更高质量的重建结果。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian通过利用新旧场景信息，实现了高质量的地图更新，适用于自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

TL;DR: GAID框架通过帧级门控融合和方向性自适应语义扰动，提升文本-视频检索的跨模态对齐和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视觉线索，忽略音频语义或采用粗粒度融合策略，导致多模态表示不理想。

Method: 提出GAID框架，包含帧级门控融合（FGF）和方向性自适应语义扰动（DASP），分别实现细粒度对齐和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在MSR-VTT等数据集上取得SOTA结果，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: GAID通过互补模块优化跨模态表示，实现了高效且稳定的文本-视频检索。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Result: 当前模型在任务中存在显著差距，需更复杂的多模态和时间感知方法。

Conclusion: HateClipSeg数据集公开可用，为仇恨言论检测研究提供了新资源。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing

Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our
three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful
Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型的分布式表示使得定位特定视觉概念的编码位置具有挑战性，需要一种有效的方法来发现相关神经元电路。

Method: 提出Granular Concept Circuit (GCC)方法，通过迭代评估神经元间的功能依赖性和语义对齐性，构建与特定查询相关的概念电路。

Result: GCC方法能够自动发现多个电路，每个电路捕获查询中的特定概念，并在多种深度图像分类模型中验证了其有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: GCC方法首次实现了细粒度水平的视觉概念电路识别，为模型提供了深刻的概念级解释。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: AMOT是一种多目标跟踪方法，通过结合外观和运动线索，解决了无人机视频中视角变化和复杂运动带来的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中的视角变化和复杂运动导致跟踪不稳定，现有方法未能充分利用外观与运动的时空交互。

Method: 提出AMOT，包含外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）和运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC），联合利用外观和运动线索。

Result: 在三个无人机基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可泛化。

Conclusion: AMOT通过结合外观和运动线索，显著提升了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Motivation: 解决多光谱/高光谱数据缺乏对应基础模型的问题，探索如何有效利用现有RSFMs处理不同光谱模态。

Method: 提出两阶段训练：第一阶段使用掩码重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间与光谱维度特征；第二阶段通过Attribute-refined Adapter迭代优化语义分割任务。

Result: SpectralX能有效适应新区域或季节的光谱图像，显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: SpectralX为光谱图像处理提供了一种无需大量预训练的高效适配方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian通过锚点图结构有效解决了现有方法的噪声和混乱问题，提升了场景理解和编辑任务的效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示开源视觉语言模型（VLM）在微调后仍可能保留基础模型的漏洞，从而面临可转移的越狱攻击风险。

Method: 方法包括Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) 和 Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG)，前者模拟视觉编码器的参数变化生成对抗图像，后者通过文本策略引导语言解码器输出对抗性结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，SEA在Qwen2-VL系列模型上实现了超过86.5%的转移攻击成功率，毒性率接近49.5%，显著优于传统PGD攻击。

Conclusion: 结论强调了保护微调后的专有VLM免受开源基础模型漏洞影响的紧迫性，呼吁开发全生命周期防御措施。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合语义特征和认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程并减少DP噪声影响，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习依赖包含敏感信息的大数据集，隐私保护成为关键问题。差分隐私数据生成虽能保护隐私，但需要大量数据且效率低。数据集蒸馏（DD）高效但现有方法受限于同步采样-优化过程和噪声训练信号。

Method: 引入新框架，解耦采样与优化，通过在信息子空间匹配减少DP噪声影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，蒸馏集大小仅为先前方法的五分之一时提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了隐私保护DD的性能，展示了其在隐私保护领域的潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利密切相关，但传统人工监测方法费时且不一致，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用多摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m模型进行检测，SAMURAI模型进行实例分割，以及运动感知的Kalman滤波和数据关联技术进行追踪。

Result: 系统在多目标追踪准确率（MOTA）和身份识别（IDF1）方面表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时准确追踪复杂环境中的奶牛，有望通过活动量化提升疾病早期预测能力。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Method: 提出VPN范式，构建R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP数据集，设计VPNet网络，并采用视图级和轨迹级数据增强策略。

Result: 实验评估了视觉提示形式、俯视图格式和数据增强策略对导航性能的影响。

Conclusion: VPN通过视觉提示显著提升导航效率，适合非专业用户，减少语言歧义。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少术前肝脏手术规划中对肝脏血管结构先验知识的依赖，提高分割效率。

Method: 使用3D点表示CT图像，添加图推理模块学习点邻域间的亲和力，隐式学习肝脏血管结构。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，Dice系数和平均表面距离得分优于四种点基方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需显式血管结构先验知识，通过图推理模块实现了高效的Couinaud分割。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续手语识别（CSLR）中的技术挑战，特别是跨签名者的泛化问题，以提升系统的通用性。

Method: 采用数据为中心的方法，包括特征选择、预处理流程（DBSCAN异常过滤和空间归一化）和CSLRConformer架构（结合CNN-Transformer设计）。

Result: 在开发集和测试集上分别达到5.60%和12.01%的词错误率（WER），比赛排名第三。

Conclusion: 验证了跨领域架构适应的有效性，Conformer模型在手语识别中实现了新的最佳性能。

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型和物理增强的运动优化框架，用于从视频中恢复3D手部运动，显著提升了重建的准确性和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单目图像中的3D手部重建已取得进展，但从视频中生成准确且时间一致的运动估计仍具挑战性，尤其是在手与物体交互时。

Method: 通过扩散模型和物理增强的运动优化模型，利用运动捕捉数据训练模型，结合手与物体交互的物理知识（如关键运动状态和约束），迭代去噪生成改进的运动序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种逐帧重建方法的性能，在现有基准测试中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合扩散模型和物理知识，有效提升了3D手部运动重建的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据因其非结构化分布和时空不均匀性，通常需要任务特定设计，限制了现有架构的复用性。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空特征，使用空间填充曲线扩大感受野并提升效率，通过注意力机制融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集上，OmniEvent比任务特定SOTA方法性能提升高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent通过统一框架解决了事件数据的处理问题，显著提升了多任务性能，且无需修改标准视觉模型架构。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文引导的Transformer（CGT）熵模型，通过优化时空上下文建模，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有熵模型在利用时空上下文时存在计算复杂度高和空间依赖顺序建模不足的问题。

Method: 设计了CGT熵模型，包括时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器，通过教师-学生网络显式建模空间依赖顺序。

Result: CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型通过优化时空上下文建模，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

TL;DR: 研究通过结合眼动和脑电图数据，在自由视觉搜索中区分目标与非目标注视点，显著提升了现实场景中的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在明确指令和抽象视觉刺激下进行，忽视了场景上下文，而人类视觉搜索受场景特征驱动，因此需要研究更现实的场景。

Method: 采用36名参与者的用户研究，使用140个现实场景，结合眼动和脑电图特征进行分类。

Result: 新方法在跨用户评估中达到83.6%的准确率，显著优于基于扫视相关电位的旧方法（56.9%）。

Conclusion: 研究显著提升了现实场景中目标与非目标注视点的区分能力，为辅助系统提供了更有效的技术支持。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Conclusion: DiffusionFF通过扩散模型和特征融合，显著提升了伪造检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流场景中具有实用价值，提升了主动决策和响应能力。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Motivation: 医疗影像研究依赖大规模数据共享，但患者隐私保护是关键挑战。现有去标识化工具缺乏客观评估方法，限制了其可靠性和可重复性。

Method: 开发了包含合成PHI/PII的DICOM数据集（MIDI），并提供了评估工具，包括Python脚本和答案键，支持自动化比较。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗图像去标识化提供了客观、标准化的评估方法，促进了更安全、一致的数据共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

Motivation: 全天的智能眼镜需要高效的多模态AI代理进行连续感知，但能耗问题限制了其实际应用。

Method: EgoTrigger通过轻量级音频模型（YAMNet）和自定义分类头，利用手-物交互（HOI）音频线索（如抽屉开启声）选择性激活摄像头。

Result: 在QA-Ego4D和HME-QA数据集上，EgoTrigger平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能耗，同时性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger为全天候智能眼镜提供了一种高效、节能的上下文感知触发策略，支持记忆增强应用。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Motivation: 探索统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业检测中的可行性，以简化多任务视觉流程。

Method: 使用InspectVLM（基于Florence-2）和新的多模态数据集InspectMM进行评估。

Result: InspectVLM在分类和关键点任务中表现尚可，但在核心检测指标、低提示变异性下表现脆弱，且输出退化。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs缺乏视觉基础和鲁棒性，不适合高精度工业检测。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell

TL;DR: DBOM框架通过结构化解耦和视觉语言模型，主动识别和消除数据集中的已知和未知后门威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络和生成式AI易受后门攻击，传统方法难以检测多触发器和未见配置。

Method: DBOM利用视觉语言模型分解输入表示，通过视觉提示库和提示前缀调优分离触发器和对象特征。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上，DBOM能有效检测中毒图像，提升训练管道安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM为零样本泛化提供了新方法，增强了对抗攻击模式的理解和防御能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

Motivation: 减少YOLO系列目标检测器对大规模标注数据的依赖，探索自监督学习在目标检测中的潜力。

Method: 使用SimCLR框架预训练YOLOv5和YOLOv8的骨干网络，通过全局池化和投影头优化对比损失，并在COCO无标注数据集上进行训练，随后在有限标注数据的任务中微调。

Result: SSL预训练的YOLOv8在mAP@50:95上达到0.7663，优于监督学习版本，尤其在低标注数据情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 对比自监督学习为单阶段检测器提供了高效的预训练方法，展示了无标注数据在目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，可无缝集成到下游任务，为自动驾驶点云下采样提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Conclusion: IMoRe框架通过隐式程序引导实现了更精确的运动推理，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法有望实现实时高分辨率非视距成像，并扩展其应用平台范围。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Result: 在三个图像生成任务上的实验表明，该方法在忠实反映图像提示方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Stratified Attention有效解决了图像提示生成中的冲突问题，并实现了逼真度与对齐的平衡。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

Result: 实验表明，现有ADVLM在闭环条件下的性能仍有局限。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLM的闭环评估提供了统一框架，揭示了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

Motivation: 应对面部识别技术滥用导致的隐私问题，如未经同意的身份推断和数字足迹暴露。

Method: 将用户的3D面部特征封装为姿态不变的2D表示，并动态变形为自然3D面具应用于在线共享前的图像。

Result: 实验显示Protego显著降低检索准确率，性能优于现有方法至少2倍，且视觉一致性高。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别滥用，保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose是首个用于放疗剂量预测的条件扩散模型，显著提升自动化治疗计划的效率和通用性。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

Method: 从Mapillary数据集中提取并手动标注细粒度交通标志类别，构建MVV数据集，并对比了多种视觉语言模型与DINOv2的性能。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2为自动驾驶场景中的细粒度视觉理解提供了可靠基准，推动了更可解释和可扩展的感知系统发展。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Method: 采用分层级联框架（HCF），引入策略驱动的量化控制和边缘量化原则。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升最高0.6dB，BD-Rate降低最高12.64%，计算资源节省显著。

Conclusion: HCF在性能和效率上优于现有方法，支持无重训练的跨质量适应。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散框架和时空引导机制，显著提升了3D姿态估计的性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致问题，结构化报告能提供标准化、简洁的信息组织方式。

Method: 构建了MIMIC-STRUC数据集，训练基于LLM的模型生成标准化报告，并提出了新的评估指标S-Score。

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制化评估指标对放射学报告生成更有效，提供了更临床相关的质量衡量标准。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在动态时空交互理解上存在显著局限，无法像人类一样轻松追踪和推理物体的运动、旋转和视角变化。

Method: 通过构建包含多样视频和精心设计问答对的VLM4D基准，评估现有VLMs的时空推理能力，并探索改进方法如4D特征场重建和时空监督微调。

Result: 评估显示现有VLMs在时空推理上表现显著低于人类基线，尤其在整合多视觉线索和保持时间连贯性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: VLM4D为提升VLMs的时空理解能力提供了基准和方向，推动了动态环境中更可靠的视觉智能发展。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合，解决了分布式开源LoRA模块的三大挑战：稀疏元数据标注、零样本适应需求和多LoRA融合策略不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FLUX和Stable Diffusion v3等大规模模型在逼真图像生成方面取得了进展，但其实际部署仍受限于参数微调的困难。现有LoRA模块在分布式应用中面临元数据稀疏、零样本适应和多模块融合效率低的问题。

Method: 框架包含两部分：(1)基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，建立LoRA参数矩阵与文本提示的共享语义空间；(2)细粒度门控融合机制，动态计算网络层和扩散时间步的融合权重。

Result: 该方法显著提升了图像生成性能，支持基础模型的可扩展和数据高效增强。

Conclusion: 该研究为社区开发的LoRA模块与实际部署需求之间建立了桥梁，通过标准化适配器集成推动了协作式模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeflareMamba利用状态空间模型高效去除镜头光晕，同时保持局部-全局依赖关系，显著提升了光晕去除效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜头光晕去除因光与镜头复杂交互导致信息混淆，现有方法难以保持上下文一致性。

Method: 提出分层框架，通过变步长采样建立长程像素关联，并利用局部增强状态空间模型保留细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效去除多种光晕，同时保持非光晕区域自然外观。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态检测框架NRE-Net，结合RGB图像、事件流和预测的法线图，通过自适应融合模块提升恶劣光照条件下的物体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下，RGB和事件数据单独使用均不足以应对复杂场景（如反射干扰），需结合几何线索提升检测鲁棒性。

Method: 引入NRE-Net框架，融合RGB、事件流和预测的法线图，采用ADFM和EAFM模块优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，mAP50分别提升7.9%/6.1%和2.7%/7.1%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过多模态融合显著提升恶劣光照下的检测性能，验证了法线图作为几何线索的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频扩散增强的4D高斯泼溅框架，解决了动态场景建模中的时间连续性和快速运动物体建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖预校准物体轨迹或难以从欠采样捕获中准确建模快速运动物体，存在时间不连续性挑战。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型提取时间一致性先验，引入联合时间戳优化策略和不确定性蒸馏方法。

Result: 显著提升动态建模效果，尤其是快速运动物体，新视角合成的PSNR增益约2 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法通过视频扩散增强有效解决了动态场景建模的局限性。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于感知的神经网络质量度量方法，用于直接评估BRDF模型的质量，无需渲染过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，需要一种更准确的评估方法。

Method: 使用多层感知器（MLP）构建神经网络，输入参考和近似BRDF样本，预测感知质量（JOD分数）。

Result: 该神经网络度量与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间度量。

Conclusion: 该度量方法为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案，尽管在BRDF拟合中表现有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

TL;DR: Free-MoRef是一种无需训练的方法，通过多参考注意力机制和并行处理长视频帧，显著提升了视频多模态大语言模型在长视频场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLM）受限于上下文长度，在长视频场景中表现不佳，常见解决方案牺牲了特征粒度或推理效率。

Method: 提出Free-MoRef，将视觉令牌重构为多个短序列作为多参考，引入MoRef-attention并行收集线索，并通过参考融合步骤生成最终混合推理序列。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和LongVideoBench上的实验表明，Free-MoRef能够感知2倍至8倍更长的输入帧，且计算成本更低，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef在保持即时响应的同时，显著提升了长视频理解的效率和效果，甚至优于专门训练的长视频模型。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Result: 航拍图像使地图构建精度提升15-23%，轨迹预测性能提升2%。

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展的环境上下文来源，AID4AD数据集公开以促进相关研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Method: 提出TrackletGait框架，包括随机轨迹采样、Haar小波下采样和硬度排除三元组损失。

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅使用10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在复杂场景中表现出色，为步态识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，且联合训练推理和分割会降低像素级精度。

Method: 使用结构化思维链提示和特征蒸馏损失，分两阶段训练：自校正推理路径和强化学习优化。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到未引用分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理能力和语言理解，显著提升了音频-视觉分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在美学属性的细粒度控制上存在挑战，尤其是需要连续和强度特定调整时，现有方法依赖模糊文本提示或高成本人工数据，限制了可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 通过预训练视觉语言模型的语义相似性量化抽象美学，并采用轻量级值编码器将标量强度映射到扩散生成的可学习嵌入中。

Result: AttriCtrl实现了对单个属性的精确控制以及灵活的多属性组合，且与流行的开源可控生成框架完全兼容。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl在美学属性控制上表现出色，具有强大的集成能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Conclusion: DreamPainter和DreamEcom-400K为电商背景生成提供了高质量解决方案，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

*Tom Fischer,Xiaojie Zhang,Eddy Ilg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一模型，将检测和姿态估计整合到单一框架中，通过神经网格模型和多模型RANSAC，在RGB图像上实现了最先进的类别级姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖RGB-D输入或分阶段处理，限制了灵活性和性能。

Method: 使用神经网格模型结合多模型RANSAC，统一检测和姿态估计。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上，平均性能提升22.9%，且鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: 统一框架在RGB图像上的姿态估计表现优异，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡主题和风格时表现不佳，且需要额外训练或依赖复杂超参数。

Method: 提出EST-LoRA，基于能量、风格差异和时间步长自适应选择LoRA，类似MoE架构。

Result: 实验表明，EST-LoRA在质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA是一种高效且无需训练的LoRA融合方法，显著提升生成效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常简化光照问题，假设单一光源或均匀光照，导致光照不一致、纹理泄漏和颜色失真等问题。

Method: 提出一种基于Retinex模型的学习框架，利用显式色度和亮度组件指导光照与反射的分离。

Result: 在现有基准和CL3AN数据集上表现出色，增强了非均匀彩色光照和材料特定反射变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算成本竞争力的同时，有效解决了复杂光照下的图像恢复问题。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法因点云区分难度不足导致模型崩溃和结构信息缺失，影响了表示可靠性和性能。

Method: GaussianCross通过3D高斯散射技术将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并结合三属性自适应蒸馏散射模块构建3D特征场，捕捉多模态一致性特征。

Result: 在ScanNet等基准测试中，GaussianCross表现出色，参数和数据效率高，性能优于现有方法，泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过创新的跨模态学习架构，有效解决了3D点云表示中的问题，为3D场景理解提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DICOM文件中的个人可识别信息（PII）和健康识别信息（PHI）需要去标识化以符合HIPAA等隐私法规。

Method: 采用基于HIPAA安全港方法的算法，通过可定制参数对DICOM标签进行分类和去标识化。

Result: 成功识别并去标识化了敏感信息（如姓名、病史、个人数据和机构）。

Conclusion: 开发的算法灵活且高效，适用于不同场景，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

<details>

Motivation: Deepfake视频的传播引发信任危机，现有方法缺乏对弱监督多模态细粒度时序伪造定位（WS-MTFL）的系统研究。

Method: 采用多任务学习范式，结合视觉和音频模态检测任务，利用Mixture-of-Experts结构和特征增强模块提升灵活性及定位精度。

Result: 实验表明WMMT在WS-MTFL中效果显著，多项指标媲美全监督方法。

Conclusion: WMMT为弱监督多模态时序伪造定位提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，现有测试时适应（TTA）方法因依赖梯度回传而不适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播，无需梯度回传；设计域知识管理方案以减少干扰并积累知识。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有方法提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA为量化模型提供了一种高效且鲁棒的测试时适应方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对抗训练方法RPAT，通过优化模型对扰动的感知一致性，缓解了对抗训练中准确性与鲁棒性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练（AT）在提升模型鲁棒性的同时会导致干净样本准确率下降，作者认为这是由于对难对抗样本的过度学习，而非学习不足。

Method: 定义了新的目标函数Robust Perception，并提出了RPAT方法，鼓励模型对输入扰动的感知变化平滑。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，RPAT优于4种常见基线和12种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化感知一致性，有效缓解了对抗训练中的准确性与鲁棒性权衡问题。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统Mamba模型因固定扫描方式无法动态利用内容依赖关系，限制了其在图像压缩中的表现。

Method: 提出CAM模型，采用内容感知令牌重组和全局先验集成，优化Mamba的动态依赖捕捉能力。

Result: CMIC模型在Kodak、Tecnick和CLIC基准测试中，BD-rate分别降低15.91%、21.34%和17.58%，超越VTM-21.0。

Conclusion: CAM通过动态内容适应和全局依赖优化，显著提升了图像压缩性能，为LIC领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Result: 在七种器官和六种任务中，COSFormer表现优于现有持续学习框架。

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床WSI分析中高效的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

Motivation: 现有方法（如TaylorSeer）在加速DiTs推理时存在内存和计算开销大、固定缓存计划导致质量下降的问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后块级，并引入动态缓存机制，根据预测误差决定是否信任泰勒预测。

Result: 在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17x、2.36x和4.14x的加速，质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和生成质量之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于低资源应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Conclusion: I2CR框架通过文本优先和视觉补充的策略，显著提升了多模态实体链接的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DerProp通过严格正则化的相似性度量有效解决了伪标签的不可靠问题。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the
Patho-AgenticRAG repository:

TL;DR: SplatSSC提出了一种基于深度引导初始化和高斯聚合器的单目3D语义场景补全框架，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因随机初始化高斯基元导致的低效率和异常基元问题。

Method: 采用深度分支（GMF模块）生成稀疏高斯基元，并使用解耦高斯聚合器（DGA）减少噪声。

Result: 在Occ-ScanNet数据集上，IoU和mIoU分别提升6.3%和4.1%，延迟和内存消耗降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过深度引导和DGA显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能和效率。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hermes的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，用于超声图像分类和分割，解决了伪标签选择和任务间信息共享的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于置信度的伪标签选择容易产生过度自信但错误的预测，且分割与分类任务独立处理，未能充分探索任务间的关联性。

Method: 提出双阈值对比学习策略，结合伪标签辅助对比学习；开发任务间注意力和显著性模块促进信息共享；设计任务间一致性学习策略对齐肿瘤特征。

Result: 在两个公共超声数据集和一个私有数据集上的实验表明，Hermes在多种半监督设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过改进伪标签选择和任务间协作，显著提升了半监督对比学习在超声图像分类和分割中的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

TL;DR: SGAD提出了一种新的语义和几何感知描述符网络，通过生成高区分度的区域描述符，直接匹配而无需复杂图优化，显著提升了匹配的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于A2PM框架的研究依赖低效的像素级比较和复杂图匹配，限制了可扩展性。

Method: SGAD通过生成高区分度的区域描述符，直接匹配；采用分类和排序子任务的新型监督策略；引入HCRF消除重叠区域。

Result: SGAD显著提升性能，运行时间减少60倍（0.82s vs. 60.23s），在室内外姿态估计中均表现优异。

Conclusion: SGAD通过创新方法实现了高效准确的区域匹配，成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对疾病诊断至关重要，但现有方法在跨模态性能上存在不足，尤其是边缘信息在预训练中的影响未被系统研究。

Method: 通过比较边缘增强和原始数据预训练的模型性能，提出基于图像熵和标准差的元学习策略来选择最佳预训练方式。

Conclusion: 边缘增强预训练需选择性应用，元学习策略能有效优化跨模态分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅依赖事件相机的立体3D物体检测框架，解决了高速场景下传统传感器的感知间隙问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR和RGB相机在高动态场景中存在感知间隙，事件相机因其异步性和高时间分辨率成为解决方案。

Method: 引入双滤波器机制提取语义和几何信息，并通过目标中心信息对齐边界框以增强回归。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中优于现有方法，展示了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 仅依赖事件相机的框架在高速场景中表现优异，为连续时间3D感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoMet是一种新的训练策略，用于深度异常检测模型，能够在未筛选的数据集上学习，无需手动过滤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督异常检测方法假设训练数据均为正常样本，需手动筛选，引入偏差且适应性差。

Method: 结合Soft Confident Learning（降低低置信度样本权重）和Meta-Learning（基于训练验证损失协方差正则化更新），防止过拟合并增强对噪声数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD、VIADUCT和KSDD2数据集上，CoMet优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并在所有数据集上达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: CoMet通过消除手动筛选需求，提高了异常检测模型的适应性和鲁棒性，适用于任何基于梯度下降的异常检测方法。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Method: 采用全身自监督表征学习结合竞争风险建模，模拟临床筛查场景并结合心脏MRI数据。

Conclusion: 全身表征学习可作为独立筛查工具或多模态框架的一部分，具有早期个性化风险分层的临床潜力。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Method: 比较学习延迟模型和不确定性量化方法在眼科数据集上的性能，评估其分类青光眼的能力和延迟决策的准确性。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在数据分布外情况下表现更稳健，适合作为AI延迟策略。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法可能是AI延迟决策的更有前景的选择。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Motivation: 解决复杂文本渲染和图像编辑一致性的挑战，提升模型在多语言和图像生成任务中的表现。

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在图像生成和编辑任务中展现出强大能力，为复杂文本渲染和一致性编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 结合指令对比学习和描述性信息可显著提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力。

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Conclusion: LPD通过解相关和多样化公共空间，显著提升了视频搜索的全面性和多样性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Motivation: 解决音频驱动方法对高质量配对数据的依赖以及声学映射到唇部动作的模糊性问题，提升生成的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用viseme序列作为中间表示，设计渐进式音素-音频替换策略，结合跨模态注意力增强特征，并通过地标引导的渲染器生成视频。

Result: 在语义保真度、视觉真实感和模态鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控且灵活的说话人脸生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a

TL;DR: OTIP是一个零样本框架，利用最优传输理论在整流流模型中实现图像反转，平衡重建保真度和编辑灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像反转在整流流模型中至关重要，但如何在重建保真度和编辑灵活性之间取得平衡是一个挑战。

Method: 通过最优传输理论指导反转过程，计算图像和噪声分布之间的最优传输路径。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，LPIPS得分为0.001，SSIM为0.992，重建损失比现有方法提升7.8%至12.9%。

Conclusion: OTIP在保持计算效率的同时，实现了高保真重建和编辑灵活性，适用于多种编辑任务。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道，用于识别港口物流中的运输单元（TUs），解决了缺乏公开基准数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏捕捉真实港口环境多样性和动态性的公开数据集，港口物流中运输单元的识别效率受限。

Method: 提出TRUDI数据集（35,034个标注实例）和TITUS管道（三阶段：分割、检测ID位置、识别验证ID）。

Result: TITUS在不同视角、光照和天气条件下可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: 公开TRUDI数据集支持新方法开发，提升港口物流效率，推动数字化转型。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一生成和评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了布局设计的效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动无监督对象定位领域的发展，提供一种简单有效的方法。

Method: 使用CutOnce生成伪标签，结合自训练优化检测器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COLER是一种零样本无监督模型，具有潜力推动无监督对象定位的进展。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测方法缺乏标准化测量技术，且对不同植物特性的适应性不足，导致在实际农业应用中的效果有限。

Method: 设计了一个CNN网络融合毫米波深度图像和RGB图像，结合基于Transformer的编码器生成特征图，并通过分类器进行检测，同时通过数据增强提升模型泛化能力。

Result: Hydra在多种植物上实现了高达96%的分类准确率，在农场实际部署中（如雨天或光线不足的夜晚）仍保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra通过多模态传感器融合和数据增强，显著提升了LWD检测的精度和鲁棒性，为农业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former通过超图建模和多头注意力机制，显著提升了多变量时间序列分析的性能。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）存在模态偏差问题，导致对象幻觉。提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整注意力和对比解码策略来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在对象幻觉问题上表现不佳，研究发现其不仅忽略视觉信息，还可能忽略文本模态，导致模态偏差。

Method: 通过干预和调整文本与视觉标记的注意力权重，结合对比解码策略，平衡跨模态兼容性。

Result: 实验证实模态偏差广泛存在，所提方法有效缓解了多个开源LVLM和基准测试中的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和高效性，为缓解LVLM的幻觉问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种侵袭性强、常见的脑肿瘤，中位生存期仅10-15个月。预测OS对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。

Method: 利用ViTs直接从MRI图像提取特征，避免传统方法中的肿瘤分割步骤。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试，准确率达62.5%，性能在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学影像任务中具有潜力，为高效且无需分割的OS预测模型奠定了基础，但数据集规模限制了其泛化能力。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新设计和训练策略，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

TL;DR: SAMPO是一种新框架，通过偏好优化让视觉基础模型从稀疏视觉交互中推断高级类别意图，解决了SAM在密集同质对象分割中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM只能分割明确提示的对象，无法泛化到用户隐含期望的语义相关实例，这在密集同质对象（如生物医学核分割）中尤为关键。

Method: SAMPO通过偏好优化，无需依赖语言模型，使模型能隐式捕捉目标类特征，实现稀疏提示下的鲁棒多对象分割。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中，SAMPO表现优异，仅用10%训练数据就显著优于所有基线方法，如PanNuke-T2任务中提升9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型提供了一种新的意图感知对齐范式，摆脱了对辅助提示生成器或语言模型辅助偏好学习的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

Motivation: 现有多类图像异常检测模型在性能上通常不如单类模型，且类别信息的使用方式对检测阈值定义的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出HierCore框架，利用分层记忆库估计类别的异常检测决策标准，无需类别标签即可有效工作。

Result: 实验验证HierCore在四种不同场景下均满足需求，性能稳定且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类异常检测任务中具有实际应用潜力，能够适应不同类别标签可用性的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: FMS通过多监督机制有效提升了多模态篡改检测的性能。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

TL;DR: ReMake是一种新的深度补全框架，通过实例掩码和单目深度估计，显式区分透明区域，提升深度预测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的光学特性导致深度相机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，影响机器人抓取的准确性和可靠性。现有方法依赖模型隐式推断深度值的可靠性，但泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出ReMake框架，利用实例掩码显式区分透明区域，结合单目深度估计提供深度上下文，专注于透明区域的深度学习。

Result: 实验表明，ReMake在基准数据集和真实场景中均优于现有方法，表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式区分透明区域和结合单目深度估计，显著提升了深度补全的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户生成内容（UGC）的快速增长使得视频参与度预测对优化推荐系统和内容创作至关重要，但现有方法难以有效建模多模态特征的交互。

Method: 采用VideoLLaMA2（整合音频、视觉和语言模态）和Qwen2.5-VL（仅视觉和语言模态）进行实验，并在SnapUGC数据集上训练。

Result: 两种模型均表现优异，其中VideoLLaMA2因整合音频特征表现更佳，最终方法在ICCV VQualA 2025挑战赛中夺冠。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在视频参与度预测中具有潜力，音频特征的整合显著提升性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术斑马线旨在提升行人安全和可见性，但其视觉复杂性可能干扰依赖视觉的监控系统。

Method: 通过将不同街头艺术图案合成到固定监控场景中，评估模型在正常和恶意设计斑马线下的行人检测表现。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，恶意设计图案可故意遮蔽行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调在设计鲁棒行人感知模型时需考虑环境视觉变化。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别以优化带宽使用和车辆检测精度，提升智能交通系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中，带宽限制和视频质量下降影响实时车辆检测精度，需动态调整压缩级别以适应环境变化。

Method: 采用PAVC框架，根据天气和光照条件动态调整视频压缩级别，平衡带宽需求和检测精度。

Result: PAVC提升车辆检测精度13%，带宽需求减少8.23倍（中等带宽）至72倍（极低带宽）。

Conclusion: PAVC有效优化带宽使用并保持检测性能，适用于智能交通系统。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法面临多样性不足、错误累积和物理不合理性等问题，ReMoMask旨在通过创新技术解决这些挑战。

Method: ReMoMask结合了双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-无分类器引导，优化跨模态检索和运动生成。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML基准测试中，ReMoMask的FID分数分别提升了3.88%和10.97%，优于现有最佳方法RAG-T2M。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过创新设计显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

Motivation: 当前VQA基准测试仅依赖点估计评估MLLMs，忽略了性能方差问题，如随机模型输出、训练种子敏感性和超参数配置等。

Method: 通过分析14个VQA基准测试，研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能方差的影响，并探索了Cloze式评估的有效性。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，性能方差显著影响结果可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议采用方差感知方法，以促进MLLMs的更稳健和可靠发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态重建方法主要局限于短时小规模变形，且缺乏物理一致性考虑，无法解决大时空跨度复杂刚体运动建模的挑战。

Method: 1) 目标建模：通过动态场景分解和改进的点密度控制实现对象中心化重建；2) 运动恢复：学习每帧SE(3)位姿恢复完整运动序列，引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略。

Result: 实验表明，PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过结合物理约束和自适应学习策略，有效解决了复杂刚体运动重建的挑战。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

TL;DR: MedVLThinker提出了一种开放且可复现的方法，用于构建基于推理的医学大模型，通过两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR）和系统性数据筛选，发现RLVR在性能上显著优于SFT，且仅使用文本数据训练效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏开放且可复现的方法来构建基于推理的医学大模型，阻碍了社区的研究和比较。

Method: 通过系统性数据筛选（文本和图像-文本数据）和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR），构建MedVLThinker模型。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker为医学多模态推理研究提供了强大的开放基础，推动了社区研究的发展。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Conclusion: AugPT是一种高效、自包含的提示调优方法，显著提升模型表现。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

Result: MTL在CAVs中展现出潜力，但仍存在研究空白，如实时性和多任务权衡问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注MTL方法的优化，以推动CAV系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Conclusion: BarlowWalk通过自监督学习显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), driven by data-driven methods, has become an
effective solution for robot leg motion control problems. However, the
mainstream RL methods for bipedal robot terrain traversal, such as
teacher-student policy knowledge distillation, suffer from long training times,
which limit development efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes
BarlowWalk, an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method integrated
with self-supervised representation learning. This method employs the Barlow
Twins algorithm to construct a decoupled latent space, mapping historical
observation sequences into low-dimensional representations and implementing
self-supervision. Meanwhile, the actor requires only proprioceptive information
to achieve self-supervised learning over continuous time steps, significantly
reducing the dependence on external terrain perception. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in complex terrain
scenarios. To enhance the credibility of the evaluation, this study compares
BarlowWalk with advanced algorithms through comparative tests, and the
experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: RIMAOS2C提升了机器人操作系统的通信能力，为自动驾驶分布式计算架构的通信优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Robotic middleware is fundamental to ensuring reliable communication among
system components and is crucial for intelligent robotics, autonomous vehicles,
and smart manufacturing. However, existing robotic middleware often struggles
to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission
efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in
large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a
service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to
tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast,
RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple
cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. Its core
mechanism, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs
shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy
and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty. Tested on L4 vehicles and Jetson
Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the
large-message transmission bottleneck in native CyberRT. In scenarios with two
cross-chip subscribers, it eliminates message redundancy and improves
large-data transmission efficiency by 36 to 40 percent while reducing callback
latency variation by 42 to 906 percent. This research advances the
communication capabilities of robotic operating systems and proposes a novel
approach to optimizing communication in distributed computing architectures for

TL;DR: Hestia利用强化学习提出了一种通用的5自由度最佳视角预测策略，解决了3D重建中数据收集的自动化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D重建和新视角合成的数据收集过程耗时且依赖人工，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: Hestia通过定义数据集选择、观测设计、动作空间、奖励计算和学习方案等核心组件，利用强化学习训练策略。

Result: 实验表明Hestia在多个数据集和真实场景中表现稳健，适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: Hestia为自动化数据收集提供了一种高效且可推广的方法。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合模型优化与学习的方法，用于非抓取式操作，通过接触隐式轨迹优化和强化学习实现高效学习，并展示了模拟到现实的迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非抓取式操作因复杂的接触交互而具有挑战性，模型方法对误差敏感且依赖特权信息，而学习方法需要大量数据。本文旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 提出了一种框架，结合接触隐式轨迹优化（CITO）和演示引导的深度强化学习（RL），并采用特权训练策略实现模拟到现实的迁移。

Result: 方法在多个旋转操作任务中验证，成功实现了模拟到现实的迁移，仅需本体感觉、视觉和力传感。

Conclusion: 结合模型优化与学习的方法能高效解决非抓取式操作问题，且无需特权信息即可实现现实应用。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机竞速需要实时决策和鲁棒控制，但现有LMPC方法在实时性和安全性之间存在权衡，亟需改进。

Method: 引入动态成本函数、局部安全集和笛卡尔坐标系，优化LMPC框架，提升时间最优性和安全性。

Result: 仿真和实验显示，算法将圈速提升最高60.85%，即使对最优控制器MPCC++也能提升6.05%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升无人机竞速性能，同时确保安全性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring
real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics.
While iterative learning model predictive control~(LMPC) offers a promising
framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to
drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off
between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with
three key innovations:~(1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights
time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence,~(2)~a shifted local safe
set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates,
and~(3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints
without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame
transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories
generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a
maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85\%. Even applied to the most
aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real
drone, a 6.05\% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method
pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation
and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak
performance of drone racing.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注提升机器人能力，但缺乏对机器人如何在高风险任务中安全执行任务的研究，尤其是在人类环境中。机器人需赢得人类操作员的信任才能成为有效的协作伙伴。

Method: 提出人机红队测试范式，通过人机协作挑战环境假设并探索潜在危险，实现危险识别、风险评估、风险缓解和安全报告。

Conclusion: 人机红队测试为高风险任务中的安全操作和信任建立提供了可行方法。

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有单特征距离启发式方法在数据检索中的局限性，如引入无关数据或忽略任务目标。

Method: 采用自适应晚期融合机制，通过任务特定组合多线索选择相关数据，并使用重要性采样优化策略训练。

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中分别优于现有方法5.1%和16.6%。

Conclusion: COLLAGE是一种通用且高效的方法，能灵活结合多种检索启发式，显著提升少样本模仿学习性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

methodology, which leads to its superior form factor, robustness,

materials includes minimal off-the-shelf components, readily available custom
electronics from online vendors, and structural parts that can be manufactured
on hobbyist 3D printers. A preliminary user assembly study confirms that Q8bot
can be easily replicated, with an average assembly time of under one hour by a
single person. With heuristic open-loop control, Q8bot achieves a stable
walking speed of 5.4 body lengths per second and a turning speed of 5 radians
per second, along with other dynamic movements such as jumping and climbing
moderate slopes.

Result: 在自主社交导航应用中，该方法能灵活适应动态环境，实时满足安全性需求。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效结合了学习和优化的优势，提升了机器人行为规划的安全性和适应性。

Abstract: Planning safe and effective robot behavior in dynamic, human-centric
environments remains a core challenge due to the need to handle uncertainty,
adapt in real-time, and ensure safety. Optimization-based planners offer
explicit constraint handling but rely on oversimplified initialization,
reducing solution quality. Learning-based planners better capture multimodal
possible solutions but struggle to enforce constraints such as safety. In this
paper, we introduce a unified generation-refinement framework bridging learning
and optimization with a novel reward-guided conditional flow matching (CFM)
model and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control. Our key innovation is
in the incorporation of a bidirectional information exchange: samples from a
reward-guided CFM model provide informed priors for MPPI refinement, while the
optimal trajectory from MPPI warm-starts the next CFM generation. Using
autonomous social navigation as a motivating application, we demonstrate that
our approach can flexibly adapt to dynamic environments to satisfy safety
requirements in real-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL方法忽视了人形机器人的形态对称性，导致运动不协调和性能不佳。受人类运动控制的启发，研究提出SE-Policy以解决这一问题。

Method: SE-Policy框架在actor中嵌入严格对称等变性，在critic中嵌入对称不变性，无需额外超参数。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的实验中，SE-Policy将跟踪精度提高了40%，并实现了更好的时空协调性。

Conclusion: SE-Policy有效提升了人形机器人的运动协调性和任务性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The human nervous system exhibits bilateral symmetry, enabling coordinated
and balanced movements. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot,
leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor
control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL
framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry
invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces
consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and
spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive
experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and
real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that
SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability
to humanoid robots.

Motivation: 现有研究通常将触觉作为次要反应通道，而VLH旨在将触觉反馈与视觉和语言紧密结合，提升人机交互的沉浸感和表达能力。

Method: VLH平台包括配备双反向五杆联动阵列的8英寸四轴飞行器、VR摄像头和俯视摄像头，使用微调的OpenVLA模型处理视觉和语言输入，输出7维动作向量。采用INT8量化和高性能服务器实现实时操作。

Result: 实验显示，VLH在目标获取任务中成功率为56.7%，纹理辨别准确率为100%。在新任务中的泛化性能分别为视觉70.0%、运动54.4%、物理40.0%和语义35.0%。

Conclusion: VLH能够将触觉反馈与感知推理和意图协同进化，推动了更具表现力和沉浸感的人机交互技术。

Abstract: We present VLH, a novel Visual-Language-Haptic Foundation Model that unifies
perception, language, and tactile feedback in aerial robotics and virtual
reality. Unlike prior work that treats haptics as a secondary, reactive
channel, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues as a direct
consequence of contextual visual understanding and natural language commands.
Our platform comprises an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar
linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, an egocentric VR camera, and an
exocentric top-down view. Visual inputs and language instructions are processed
by a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450
multimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx,
Hy, Hz, Hv). INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time
operation at 4-5 Hz. In human-robot interaction experiments (90 flights), VLH
achieved a 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s,
pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization
tests yielded 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0%
(semantic) performance on novel tasks. These results demonstrate VLH's ability
to co-evolve haptic feedback with perceptual reasoning and intent, advancing
expressive, immersive human-robot interactions.

Result: 残差学习显著优于从头训练，样本效率和任务性能更优，仿真策略可直接部署到现实系统。

Conclusion: MoRe-ERL框架有效提升了轨迹优化和任务性能，仿真到现实的迁移效果良好。

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong
learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in
real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task
correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the
Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System
(hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and
the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and
cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the
framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via
parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic
submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent
architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations
on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline
(Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the
closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing
new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory,
long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning
capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks.
RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a
foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical
robots.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了模仿学习在光照变化下的泛化能力，并支持多种下游应用。

Abstract: Despite advances in data augmentation, policies trained via imitation
learning still struggle to generalize across environmental variations such as
lighting changes. To address this, we propose the first framework that
leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on
real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the
first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and
material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to
render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent
augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on
robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our
framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented
sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning
generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using
720 real-world evaluations. We further showcase three downstream applications
enabled by the proposed framework.

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete
in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos of experiments:

Result: HALO在真实场景中表现优异，成功率和轨迹长度等指标显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HALO在视觉导航任务中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HALO, a novel Offline Reward Learning algorithm
that quantifies human intuition in navigation into a vision-based reward
function for robot navigation. HALO learns a reward model from offline data,
leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training,
actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using
preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the
preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive
navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to
align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO,
we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline
learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a
model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward
as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both
learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments
on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained
with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not
present in the training data. HALO outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based
navigation methods, achieving at least a 33.3% improvement in success rate, a
12.9% reduction in normalized trajectory length, and a 26.6% reduction in
Frechet distance compared to human expert trajectories.

conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically
relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain
in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and
performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather
conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse
weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model
architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is
achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of
clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.
Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential
Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to
achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind
arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed
to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence
to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded
Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed
regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather
generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess
the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large
margins.

*Sung-Wook Lee,Xuhui Kang,Brandon Yang,Yen-Ling Kuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLASS的方法，通过对比学习从演示中学习行为表示，解决了行为克隆在异构数据集上的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆在异构数据集（如不同相机视角或物体外观）上性能下降，因其倾向于过拟合单个演示而非捕捉共享结构。

Method: CLASS利用动态时间规整（DTW）识别相似动作序列，并通过监督对比学习优化软InfoNCE损失。

Result: 在5个仿真基准和3个真实任务中，CLASS表现出色，尤其在视觉变化显著的下游策略学习中，Diffusion Policy结合CLASS预训练达到75%的平均成功率。

Conclusion: CLASS通过对比学习有效提升了行为克隆的泛化能力，尤其在异构数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have led to strong performance in
robotic manipulation, driven by expressive models, sequence modeling of
actions, and large-scale demonstration data. However, BC faces significant
challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with
different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades
despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to
overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure,
limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via
Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral
representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning.
CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with
similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation
benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using
retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream
policy learning under significant visual shifts, Diffusion Policy with CLASS
pre-training achieves an average success rate of 75%, while all other baseline
methods fail to perform competitively. Project webpage:

### [248] [VFP: Variational Flow-Matching Policy for Multi-Modal Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01622)
*Xuanran Zhai,Ce Hao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VFP（Variational Flow-Matching Policy）是一种基于流匹配的机器人操作策略，通过引入变分潜在先验和Kantorovich最优传输，解决了多模态问题，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流匹配方法在多模态任务中表现不佳，容易产生模糊行为，因此需要一种能够有效捕捉任务和轨迹多模态的新方法。

Method: VFP结合了变分潜在先验、Kantorovich最优传输和混合专家解码器，实现了模式感知的动作生成和高效推理。

Result: 在41个任务上的实验表明，VFP比标准流基线方法任务成功率提高了49%，同时保持了快速推理和小模型体积。

Conclusion: VFP在多模态机器人操作任务中表现出色，是一种高效且紧凑的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

Conclusion: EPDS框架显著提升了无人机配送的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: We propose a novel Energy-Predictive Drone Service (EPDS) framework for
efficient package delivery within a skyway network. The EPDS framework
incorporates a formal modeling of an EPDS and an adaptive bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) machine learning model. This model predicts the
energy status and stochastic arrival times of other drones operating in the
same skyway network. Leveraging these predictions, we develop a heuristic
optimization approach for composite drone services. This approach identifies
the most time-efficient and energy-efficient skyway path and recharging
schedule for each drone in the network. We conduct extensive experiments using
a real-world drone flight dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework.

TL;DR: DexReMoE框架通过混合专家策略（MoE）和物体类别信息，实现了对复杂形状物体的通用性操作，显著提升了在手中物体重新定向的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂形状物体的重新定向问题，需要一种能够适应多样化几何形状的鲁棒控制策略。

Method: 提出DexReMoE框架，结合多个专家策略和物体类别信息，使用强化学习在仿真中训练。

Result: 在150种物体上平均连续成功次数达19.5，最差性能从0.69提升至6.05。

Conclusion: DexReMoE展示了在手中物体重新定向任务中的可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: In hand object reorientation provides capability for dexterous manipulation,
requiring robust control policies to manage diverse object geometries, maintain
stable grasps, and execute precise complex orientation trajectories. However,
prior works focus on single objects or simple geometries and struggle to
generalize to complex shapes. In this work, we introduce DexReMoE (Dexterous
Reorientation Mixture-of-Experts), in which multiple expert policies are
trained for different complex shapes and integrated within a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) framework, making the approach capable of generalizing across a wide
range of objects. Additionally, we incorporate object category information as
privileged inputs to enhance shape representation. Our framework is trained in
simulation using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluated on novel
out-of-distribution objects in the most challenging scenario of reorienting
objects held in the air by a downward-facing hand. In terms of the average
consecutive success count, DexReMoE achieves a score of 19.5 across a diverse
set of 150 objects. In comparison to the baselines, it also enhances the
worst-case performance, increasing it from 0.69 to 6.05. These results
underscore the scalability and adaptability of the DexReMoE framework for
general-purpose in-hand reorientation.

Motivation: 自主机器人在非结构化环境中需要准确的地形可穿越性估计，视觉语言模型（VLMs）为零样本估计提供了潜力，但问题仍具有挑战性。

Method: 引入了一个人工标注的水域可穿越性评分小数据集，并提出了一个集成VLMs的零样本估计简单流程。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前基础模型的表现参差不齐，尚不适合实际应用。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型存在局限性，但研究为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Terrain traversability estimation is crucial for autonomous robots,
especially in unstructured environments where visual cues and reasoning play a
key role. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for zero-shot
estimation, the problem remains inherently ill-posed. To explore this, we
introduce a small dataset of human-annotated water traversability ratings,
revealing that while estimations are subjective, human raters still show some
consensus. Additionally, we propose a simple pipeline that integrates VLMs for
zero-shot traversability estimation. Our experiments reveal mixed results,
suggesting that current foundation models are not yet suitable for practical
deployment but provide valuable insights for further research.

Method: 提出结构-语义共识约束以增强3D实例级聚合，并设计LLM辅助的指令到实例接地模块，结合空间上下文和目标描述进行细粒度实例选择。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Matterport3D上的实验表明，OpenMap在零样本设置下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: OpenMap有效弥合了自由形式语言与3D感知之间的鸿沟，为具身导航提供了更准确的指令接地方法。

Abstract: Grounding natural language instructions to visual observations is fundamental
for embodied agents operating in open-world environments. Recent advances in
visual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by
leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods often fall
short in aligning free-form language commands with specific scene instances,
due to limitations in both instance-level semantic consistency and instruction
interpretation. We present OpenMap, a zero-shot open-vocabulary visual-language
map designed for accurate instruction grounding in navigation tasks. To address
semantic inconsistencies across views, we introduce a Structural-Semantic
Consensus constraint that jointly considers global geometric structure and
vision-language similarity to guide robust 3D instance-level aggregation. To
improve instruction interpretation, we propose an LLM-assisted
Instruction-to-Instance Grounding module that enables fine-grained instance
selection by incorporating spatial context and expressive target descriptions.
We evaluate OpenMap on ScanNet200 and Matterport3D, covering both semantic
mapping and instruction-to-target retrieval tasks. Experimental results show
that OpenMap outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in bridging free-form language
and 3D perception for embodied navigation.

Conclusion: 角色扮演隐喻为未来人机交互设计提供了新的方向，强调创意和表达性的重要性。

Abstract: Gestures are an expressive input modality for controlling multiple robots,
but their use is often limited by rigid mappings and recognition constraints.
To move beyond these limitations, we propose roleplaying metaphors as a
scaffold for designing richer interactions. By introducing three roles:
Director, Puppeteer, and Wizard, we demonstrate how narrative framing can guide
the creation of diverse gesture sets and interaction styles. These roles enable
a variety of scenarios, showing how roleplay can unlock new possibilities for
multi-robot systems. Our approach emphasizes creativity, expressiveness, and
intuitiveness as key elements for future human-robot interaction design.

Motivation: 解决手动鼻气管插管中的交叉感染和黏膜损伤风险，填补自动化鼻气管插管的研究空白。

Method: 开发了嵌入力传感器的自主系统，并采用RACCT模型处理复杂的管-组织交互和部分视觉观察。

Result: RACCT模型优于ACT模型，平均峰值插入力降低66%，成功率与手动操作相当。

Conclusion: 该系统有望减少感染风险并提高手术安全性。

Abstract: Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is critical for establishing artificial airways
in clinical anesthesia and critical care. Current manual methods face
significant challenges, including cross-infection, especially during
respiratory infection care, and insufficient control of endoluminal contact
forces, increasing the risk of mucosal injuries. While existing studies have
focused on automated endoscopic insertion, the automation of NTI remains
unexplored despite its unique challenges: Nasotracheal tubes exhibit greater
diameter and rigidity than standard endoscopes, substantially increasing
insertion complexity and patient risks. We propose a novel autonomous NTI
system with two key components to address these challenges. First, an
autonomous NTI system is developed, incorporating a prosthesis embedded with
force sensors, allowing for safety assessment and data filtering. Then, the
Recurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer (RACCT) model is
developed to handle complex tube-tissue interactions and partial visual
observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the RACCT model outperforms
the ACT model in all aspects and achieves a 66% reduction in average peak
insertion force compared to manual operations while maintaining equivalent
success rates. This validates the system's potential for reducing infection
risks and improving procedural safety.

Conclusion: GMCs的梯度刚度设计和扩展模型为磁软连续体机器人的发展提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: Magnetic soft continuum robots are capable of bending with remote control in
confined space environments, and they have been applied in various
bioengineering contexts. As one type of ferromagnetic soft continuums, the
Magnetically Induced Metamorphic Materials (MIMMs)-based continuum (MC)
exhibits similar bending behaviors. Based on the characteristics of its base
material, MC is flexible in modifying unit stiffness and convenient in molding
fabrication. However, recent studies on magnetic continuum robots have
primarily focused on one or two design parameters, limiting the development of
a comprehensive magnetic continuum bending model. In this work, we constructed
graded-stiffness MCs (GMCs) and developed a numerical model for GMCs' bending
performance, incorporating four key parameters that determine their
performance. The simulated bending results were validated with real bending
experiments in four different categories: varying magnetic field,
cross-section, unit stiffness, and unit length. The graded-stiffness design
strategy applied to GMCs prevents sharp bending at the fixed end and results in
a more circular curvature. We also trained an expansion model for GMCs' bending
performance that is highly efficient and accurate compared to the simulation
process. An extensive library of bending prediction for GMCs was built using
the trained model.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has revolutionized the healthcare industry by
providing surgeons with greater precision, reducing invasiveness, and improving
patient outcomes. However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on
the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the
surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent
recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our
recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to
monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted
surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of
surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent
multi-modal assistive framework. This system will utilize brain activity, heart
rate, muscle activity, and eye tracking to enhance intent recognition, even in
mentally demanding situations. By improving the robotic system ability to
interpret the surgeons intentions, we can further enhance the benefits of
robot-assisted surgery and improve surgery outcomes.

Conclusion: 这项研究为模块化机器人系统通过利用环境特征突破自身限制迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Modular robotics research has long been preoccupied with perfecting the
modules themselves -- their actuation methods, connectors, controls,
communication, and fabrication. This inward focus results, in part, from the
complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile
laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the
Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and
reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In
this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better
robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular
robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion,
adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from
simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features --
ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots'
capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only
adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to
do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that
transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.

Conclusion: L3M+P通过动态知识图谱有效提升了机器人在长期部署中的规划能力。

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Abstract: World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic
simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators
with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness
of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if
the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a
pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric
employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model
predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially
controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are
interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the
standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego
vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where
top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego
agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we
propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to
uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as
pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world
models under these new metrics.

Abstract: The convergence of autonomous indoor drones with physics-aware sensing

inspection to objective, quantitative measurement. This comprehensive review
examines the technical foundations enabling this paradigm shift across four
critical domains: (1) platform architectures optimized for indoor navigation,
where weight constraints drive innovations in heterogeneous computing,
collision-tolerant design, and hierarchical control systems; (2) advanced
sensing modalities that extend perception beyond human vision, including
hyperspectral imaging for material identification, polarimetric sensing for
surface characterization, and computational imaging with metaphotonics enabling
radical miniaturization; (3) intelligent autonomy through active reconstruction
algorithms, where drones equipped with 3D Gaussian Splatting make strategic
decisions about viewpoint selection to maximize information gain within battery
constraints; and (4) integration pathways with existing property workflows,
including Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems and industry standards

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor design capable of folding its arms
vertically to grasp objects and navigate through narrow spaces. The
transformation is controlled actively by a central servomotor, gears, and
racks. The arms connect the motor bases to the central frame, forming a
parallelogram structure that ensures the propellers maintain a constant
orientation during morphing. In its stretched state, the quadrotor resembles a
conventional design, and when contracted, it functions as a gripper with
grasping components emerging from the motor bases. To mitigate disturbances
during transforming and grasping payloads, we employ an adaptive sliding mode
controller with a disturbance observer. After fully folded, the quadrotor frame
shrinks to 67% of its original size. The control performance and versatility of
the morphing quadrotor are validated through real-world experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation
have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in
isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI
navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically,
NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI
navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation
studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data
mixing strategy, and reward design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型虽在多任务中表现良好，但缺乏上下文学习能力，限制了其实际应用。论文旨在通过RICL方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过特定的微调方法和少量机器人演示数据集，将ICL能力注入VLA模型，使其能够利用上下文中的演示信息执行新任务。

Result: RICL显著提升了VLA模型在新任务中的性能，仅需20次演示即可实现改进，且无需参数更新。若允许参数更新，性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: RICL为VLA模型提供了简单有效的上下文学习接口，使其能够快速适应新任务，推动了通用机器人基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

TL;DR: SetItUp是一个神经符号框架，通过学习少量示例和结构化自然语言任务描述，解决功能对象排列（FORM）任务中的目标姿势不明确问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FORM任务中的指令通常不明确，缺乏目标姿势的具体描述，SetItUp旨在通过学习少量示例和任务描述来解决这一问题。

Method: SetItUp采用两阶段方法：1）通过LLM生成Python程序预测对象间的抽象空间关系图；2）使用扩散模型预测对象姿势。

Result: 在三个任务家族（餐桌布置、书架整理、卧室家具布局）中，SetItUp在功能、物理可行性和美观性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SetItUp通过神经符号方法有效解决了FORM任务中的目标姿势不明确问题，并在多个场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to
fulfill a function, e.g., "set up a dining table for two". One key challenge
here is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not
explicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,
a neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects
from a few training examples and a structured natural-language task
specification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract
spatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate
representation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)
predicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the
grounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to
induce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.
This program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.
For (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture
primitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object
poses based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning
three distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing
items on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show
that SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically
feasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements. This article extends
our conference paper published at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2024.

TL;DR: ScrewSplat是一种基于RGB图像的端到端方法，用于识别物体的几何和运动关节，无需额外输入或复杂步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖强假设或额外输入，限制了实际应用。

Method: 随机初始化螺旋轴并通过迭代优化恢复运动结构，结合高斯泼溅重建3D几何和分割刚性部件。

Result: 在多样化物体上达到最先进的识别精度，并支持零样本文本引导操作。

Conclusion: ScrewSplat简化了关节物体识别，提升了实用性和准确性。

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Result: 实验显示，系统逐步减少执行时间并保持高精度，适应性强。

Conclusion: 该框架确保了力基机器人任务的长期可靠性，显著减少人工干预需求。

Abstract: The automation of robotic tasks requires high precision and adaptability,
particularly in force-based operations such as insertions. Traditional
learning-based approaches either rely on static datasets, which limit their
ability to generalize, or require frequent manual intervention to maintain good
performances. As a result, ensuring long-term reliability without human
supervision remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an
adaptive self-supervised learning framework for insertion classification that
continuously improves its precision over time. The framework operates in
real-time, incrementally refining its classification decisions by integrating
newly acquired force data. Unlike conventional methods, it does not rely on
pre-collected datasets but instead evolves dynamically with each task
execution. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate how the system
progressively reduces execution time while maintaining near-perfect precision
as more samples are processed. This adaptability ensures long-term reliability
in force-based robotic tasks while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Conclusion: 矩匹配技术在稀疏和噪声场景下具有潜力，可显著提升配准性能，达到与激光雷达系统相当的结果。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Result: 实验显示DGMoE显著提升计算效率，FedVLA任务成功率与集中式训练相当，同时保护隐私。

Conclusion: FedVLA为隐私保护的VLA模型训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates
comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

of transport and ground reaction force. Our method advances robust control
strategies for point-foot bipedal robots, offering insights into broader
locomotion.

Method: TacMan-Turbo将触觉接触偏差视为局部运动学信息源，预测未来交互并主动调整。

Result: 在200个模拟和真实实验中，成功率达100%，效率、动作优化和轨迹平滑性显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 无需先验运动学知识，TacMan-Turbo成功解决了效率与有效性之间的长期权衡。

Abstract: Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate
successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both
effectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and
efficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.
Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods
relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering
structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust
manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through
reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces
TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated
object manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous
approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals
requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources
of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to
predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments,
significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations
across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments,
our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming
the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and
trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that
the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated
object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior
kinematic knowledge.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for
developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress
inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization
capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to
address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems,
represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a
cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model
parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update
the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic
estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error
reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives
generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model
selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also
equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal
estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall
motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the
size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive
learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well
as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter
and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of
the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go
arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with
the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion
planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is
demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model
represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and
operating within a cluttered environment.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

TL;DR: QuaDreamer是一个专为四足机器人设计的全景数据生成引擎，通过模拟机器人运动生成高质量全景视频，解决了训练数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于四足机器人的运动特性和传感器校准复杂，高质量全景训练数据稀缺，限制了其感知系统的发展。

Method: 提出QuaDreamer引擎，包括垂直抖动编码（VJE）、场景-对象控制器（SOC）和全景增强器（PE），用于生成可控、高质量的全景视频。

Result: 生成的视频序列可用于训练四足机器人的全景视觉感知模型，提升360度场景中的多目标跟踪性能。

Conclusion: QuaDreamer为四足机器人提供了高质量的训练数据，推动了全景感知系统的发展。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at
https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的故障感知协调框架，用于多机器人目标跟踪，能够处理临时和永久性故障，提升系统鲁棒性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多机器人系统常因传感和通信故障而性能下降，但现有研究对故障感知协调关注不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 将故障分为临时性和永久性两类，通过动态路径调整和分组协作（部分集中优化与分散优化结合）实现适应性。

Result: 在多种故障场景下测试，框架表现稳健，尤其在未知危险区域中具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架为多机器人系统提供了一种通用且实用的故障感知解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world
deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and
permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly
degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite
its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in
the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the
complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware
coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot
target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our
approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)
probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent
sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding
inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or
communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized
behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned
into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and
collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots
experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate
independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them
to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate
our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive
assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our
framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments
with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for
the multi-robot systems community.

Conclusion: 该方法使线驱动机器人摆脱对预设环境的依赖，提升了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In order to expand the operational range and payload capacity of robots,
wire-driven robots that leverage the external environment have been proposed.
It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own
structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach
multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an
operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to
specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot
that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a
multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and
environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an
anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by
flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable
attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in
environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple
wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can
autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the
benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.

Conclusion: 该控制方案具有鲁棒性和平台独立性，适用于多种机器人切割任务。

Abstract: Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the
robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact
forces, and precise motion requirements. We introduce a new virtual-model
control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators,
without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment.
Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by
virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through
analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior
settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator
demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter
slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same
controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and
adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and
platform independence.

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in orchards presents
significant challenges due to obstacles and GPS-deprived environments. In this
work, we introduce a learning-based approach to achieve vision-based navigation
of UAVs within orchard rows. Our method employs a variational autoencoder
(VAE)-based controller, trained with an intervention-based learning framework
that allows the UAV to learn a visuomotor policy from human experience. We
validate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built
quadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few
iterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously
navigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller
exhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying
distances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms.
Furthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel
environments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions
and speeds. This research not only advances UAV autonomy but also holds
significant potential for precision agriculture, improving efficiency in
orchard monitoring and management.

Conclusion: HyCodePolicy为自主决策提供了可扩展的多模态推理策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强机器人辅助护理能力，特别是在床浴和穿衣等任务中，克服现有方案假设人体静态的局限性。

Method: 使用物理模拟器结合反极采样和力闭合抓取肢体，采用MPPI和矢量场控制方法生成运动轨迹。

Result: 在不同肢体操作任务中评估，展示了对不同年龄组和真实人体模型的适用性，并在床浴任务中验证有效性。

Conclusion: Manip4Care为机器人辅助护理提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其在动态肢体操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp and reposition human limbs can significantly enhance
their ability to provide assistive care to individuals with severe mobility
impairments, particularly in tasks such as robot-assisted bed bathing and
dressing. However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the
human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address
this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables
robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our
approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for
grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision
avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with
force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to
generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical
constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks
in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age
groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our
approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further
showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.

Result: 案例研究展示了数据清理阶段的选择如何影响下游预测的不确定性。

Conclusion: PCS框架为数据科学实践提供了一种原则性方法，有助于减少不确定性并提高结果的可信度。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

Result: 在Allen-Cahn、Klein-Gordon和Navier-Stokes方程上，相对MSE降低达三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了深度学习与物理驱动建模之间的差距，为多尺度和时间依赖PDE系统提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Conclusion: 该框架为结构工程师提供了高效、安全的预测工具，优化了设计流程和决策支持。

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure
mode

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

Conclusion: GNN框架简化了实现，保持了高诊断性能，是传统方法的有力替代方案。

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Method: 提出新的MVTS幻觉定义，使用扩散模型检测和缓解幻觉，并通过关系数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示开源预训练MVTS模型的平均幻觉水平高达59.5%，提出的缓解方法可降低47.7%。

Conclusion: 新定义和方法有望提升MVTS基础模型的安全性和采用率。

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效挖掘隐藏的全局时空关系，提升交通流量预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投影松弛方法在解决NP-hard的QAP问题时，会引入数值尺度敏感性和几何不对齐误差，需要一种新方法来缓解这些问题。

Method: 提出FRA框架，将投影步骤重新表述为Frobenius正则化线性分配问题，并开发SDSN算法和混合精度架构以高效求解。

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了现有松弛方法的误差问题，同时通过混合精度架构实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种动态个性化的风险驾驶行为识别框架，利用比利时自然驾驶数据，通过滚动时间窗口和双层优化动态校准风险阈值和模型超参数。DNN在高召回任务中表现优异，XGBoost性能最平衡，随机森林对动态调整敏感。速度加权车距是更稳定的风险指标。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架依赖固定时间窗口和静态阈值，难以应对真实驾驶的随机性，因此需要动态个性化的方法。

Method: 使用滚动时间窗口和双层优化动态校准风险阈值和模型超参数，评估了三种数据驱动模型（随机森林、XGBoost、DNN）和两个安全指标（速度加权车距、激烈驾驶事件）。

Result: DNN在高召回任务中表现优异，XGBoost性能最平衡，随机森林对动态调整敏感。速度加权车距比激烈驾驶事件更稳定。

Conclusion: 自适应和个性化的风险检测方法对提升实时安全反馈和智能交通系统中的驾驶员支持具有重要价值。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习伪造检测工具对训练条件高度敏感，轻微的后处理会显著降低性能，影响实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 通过训练同一模型的不同变体，选择潜在边距最大的模型。

Result: 实验表明潜在边距分布与检测器对后处理图像的泛化能力密切相关。

Conclusion: 提出的策略能有效提升检测器对后处理图像的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Transformer模型在预训练中如何获取知识以及在微调中如何提取知识，提出了一种结合自注意力和MLP的单层Transformer框架，并证明了其在知识获取和提取上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单层、仅注意力架构，而忽略了MLP在知识存储中的作用，且简化模型可能无法有效获取或提取事实知识。

Method: 引入结合自注意力和MLP的单层Transformer框架，通过梯度动态分析，建立收敛和泛化保证。

Result: 证明Transformer在预训练中能实现接近最优的训练损失（知识获取），在特定条件下微调后能提取预训练学到的知识，否则会出现幻觉。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer的知识获取和提取提供了理论支持，并通过实验验证了结果。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained
GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with
consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout
training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k
steps), we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of
activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于经典方法和深度学习替代方案，并能无监督地识别异常特征。

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD是一种高效且通用的时间序列异常检测方法。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Method: PALACE通过GRPO增强的适应模块和轻量级领域路由器，动态校准不同推理任务的令牌使用模式。

Result: 在数学、编程、医学和通用推理基准测试中，PALACE表现出低相对误差和高预测准确性。

Conclusion: PALACE为标准化预测审计迈出重要一步，提升透明度、责任感和用户信任。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

Method: 提出CaliMatch方法，采用自适应标签平滑和温度缩放技术，无需手动调整平滑度，实现有效校准。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR-10、ImageNet等）上，CaliMatch表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CaliMatch通过校准分类器和OOD检测器，显著提升了半监督学习的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态、自动、系统的红队测试框架（DAS），用于持续评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床实践中的安全性，揭示了现有模型在鲁棒性、隐私、偏见/公平性和幻觉方面的显著弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs在临床实践中的安全性和可靠性，防止患者伤害并促进AI在医疗领域的可信应用。静态安全基准测试已无法跟上LLMs的快速发展，需要动态方法。

Method: 采用DAS框架，通过对抗性代理自主变异测试用例、识别/演化不安全触发策略并实时评估响应，无需人工干预。

Result: 测试15个专有和开源LLMs发现，静态基准性能与对抗压力下的脆弱性存在显著差异。鲁棒性测试中94%的正确答案失败，隐私泄露率86%，偏见影响81%，幻觉率超过66%。

Conclusion: DAS框架为医疗AI提供了可进化、可扩展且可靠的安全保障，适用于医院、监管机构和技术供应商的动态压力测试需求。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序多模态数据（如视听数据）具有严格的时序性和多样模态性，现有方法独立处理模态且依赖浅层融合策略，无法有效捕捉复杂结构关系。

Result: 在四个多模态数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HHN能有效建模复杂分类任务中的时序多模态数据。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Result: 发现O3和NO2与死亡率存在协同关联，城市绿地密度也与污染物协同影响死亡率预测。

Conclusion: Hi-Fi框架为XAI和高阶关系分析提供了新工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合海洋知识图谱与大语言模型（OKG-LLM）的新框架，用于全球海表温度（SST）预测，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在SST预测中忽视了领域知识，限制了预测精度的进一步提升。大语言模型（LLMs）的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 构建海洋知识图谱（OKG），开发图嵌入网络学习其语义和结构知识，并与数值SST数据及预训练LLM对齐融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，OKG-LLM优于现有方法，展示了其有效性、鲁棒性和潜力。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM为SST预测提供了新思路，结合领域知识与数据驱动方法，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

TL;DR: FeatureCuts是一种新型特征选择算法，通过自适应选择最优特征截断点，显著减少特征数量和计算时间，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，特征选择旨在找到能够高效训练模型的特征子集，但现有方法在减少特征数量和计算时间方面仍有改进空间。

Method: FeatureCuts结合过滤排序和自适应特征截断选择，优化特征子集。

Result: 在14个公开数据集和1个行业数据集上，FeatureCuts平均减少15%的特征和99.6%的计算时间，同时保持模型性能；与PSO结合时，进一步减少25%的特征和66%的计算时间。

Conclusion: FeatureCuts是一种高效、可扩展的特征选择算法，适用于企业级大规模数据集。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在判别表示学习中的适应性问题，避免大规模对比预训练的高计算成本和低效性。

Method: 1. 分层嵌入提示模板：通过两级指令架构生成判别性表示。2. 自感知硬负采样：利用模型自身理解高效挖掘困难负样本并过滤假负样本。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLMs在通用嵌入任务中的高效适应提供了有效路径，显著减少训练时间。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在统一表示框架、数据压缩扩展性和跨任务泛化方面的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1) 因果Q-Former将领域特征映射到共享因果表示空间；2) 多视图RQ-VAE将嵌入离散化为紧凑令牌。

Result: 在行为预测和推荐任务中优于基线方法，同时在存储和计算上更高效。

Conclusion: U^2QT框架支持工业级应用，并能与语言模型无缝集成。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本分类在动态知识领域（如票务系统）中的困难，特别是大语言模型在泛化和数据多样性不足时的问题。

Method: 通过迭代对比提示和主动学习，结合人工干预，动态优化类别区分并引入新类别。

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia上分别达到91%和84%的准确率，引入新类别后性能稳定。

Conclusion: 基于提示的语义推理在有限监督下能有效实现细粒度分类。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Motivation: PGNNIV模型在处理高维数据（如空间场或时变系统）时面临可扩展性挑战，需要改进以提升效率和适应性。

Method: 引入降阶建模技术，如谱分解、POD和预训练自编码器，改进解码器结构，并结合迁移学习和微调策略。

Result: 改进后的PGNNIV框架成功识别了本构状态方程，提高了预测精度、噪声鲁棒性，并降低了计算需求。

Conclusion: 提出的技术可根据数据、资源和目标定制，有效解决了PGNNIV的可扩展性问题，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Motivation: 个体投资者在金融市场中处于劣势，缺乏专业分析工具。现有金融报告更新慢且非结构化，限制了LLMs的应用效果。

Method: 1. 构建FinKario数据集，包含实时公司基本面和市场事件；2. 提出FinKario-RAG两阶段图检索策略，优化知识检索。

Conclusion: FinKario和FinKario-RAG有效解决了金融知识更新慢和非结构化问题，显著提升了LLMs的金融分析能力。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态融合对生物医学信号分类性能的影响，挑战了‘更多模态必然更好’的假设。

Method: 设计并评估了五种深度学习模型（三种单模态和两种多模态），通过ECG分类任务验证模态互补性。

Result: Hybrid 1（融合时间和时频域）表现最佳，而Hybrid 2（额外加入频域）未带来改进，甚至略有下降。

Conclusion: 研究提出‘互补特征域’理论，强调模态融合的质量而非数量，为多模态设计提供了量化框架。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Motivation: 通过自动化对抗数据生成和训练，解决NLI模型在推理任务中的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 采用平衡的少样本检索（BGE和BM25）、LLM生成对抗假设并通过LLM验证，最后将对抗样本注入训练集进行迭代训练。

Conclusion: VAULT实现了高质量对抗数据的自动化生成，显著提升了NLI模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to

Result: 在多种模态组合和任务中，MORPHEUS优于现有方法，并能实现任意组学生成。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是肿瘤学中多模态基础模型的有前景框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

Result: 在实验中，SLAI将中位TTFT降低了53%，最大服务容量提升了26%，同时满足尾部TBT延迟约束。

Conclusion: SLAI调度器在提升LLM推理系统性能方面表现出色，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Conclusion: v-PuNNs将数论与深度学习结合，为分层数据提供了精确、可解释且高效的模型。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Result: 实验表明MA-PROPS能更高效减少采样误差，并提升策略梯度算法的收敛可靠性。

Conclusion: MA-PROPS通过协调动作选择有效改善多智能体强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多关注分子级性质预测，忽略了功能组信息。功能组数据能提供分子结构与文本描述间的联系，帮助构建更可解释、结构感知的LLM。

Method: 引入FGBench数据集，包含精确标注的功能组信息，支持回归和分类任务，涵盖单功能组影响、多功能组交互和分子直接比较三类问题。

Result: 当前LLM在功能组级性质推理上表现不佳，表明需要增强LLM在化学任务中的推理能力。

Conclusion: FGBench的方法论为构建功能组级数据集提供了框架，有助于LLM更好地理解分子结构与性质的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

Result: 在多个挑战性动态系统（包括高维WeatherBench数据集）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态系统的概率预测提供了数学基础，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Method: 使用树形数据结构（BUS）结合用户属性和行为，以NDCG为目标函数优化行为代表性，并利用社交图增强公平性。

Result: 离线分析显示BUS显著优于传统方法，线上测试在音乐排名和邮件通知等指标上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: BUS是首个在大规模工业场景中结合用户属性和行为的树形推荐框架，兼具语义解释性和效果提升。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Motivation: PRNGs在大型语言模型优化中至关重要，而Transformer擅长处理复杂非线性关系，因此研究基于Transformer的PRNGs具有潜在价值。

Result: Transformer生成的随机数通过多数NIST测试，热图显示明显的统计随机性，且在预测攻击中表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的PRNGs具有理论和实践可行性，能够生成高质量的伪随机数。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Result: 实验表明，DisTaC预处理后，现有合并方法能成功整合具有有害特征的模型，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: DisTaC有效解决了模型合并中的关键问题，为多任务学习提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身模仿学习中，如何平衡灾难性遗忘和新技能学习是主要挑战，现有方法忽视了二者的内在关联。

Method: 提出T2S框架，通过参数标记化将传统Transformer的线性参数映射转化为输入与可学习标记的交叉注意力，并引入语言引导技能扩展。

Result: 实验表明，T2S有效防止灾难性遗忘（NBT 1.0%）、新技能扩展高效（仅需8.0%可训练标记）、任务间知识转移高效（FWT 77.7%）。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MARS的多智能体强化学习框架，通过风险感知和动态调整来优化投资组合管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习模型在动态市场条件下难以平衡风险与回报，MARS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MARS采用异构智能体集合，每个智能体具有独特的风险偏好，并由高层Meta-Adaptive Controller动态协调。

Result: 在主要国际股票指数上的实验显示，MARS显著降低了最大回撤和波动性，同时保持竞争力回报。

Conclusion: MARS通过行为多样性而非显式市场特征工程，实现了风险与回报的优越平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的后训练优化采用风险中性目标（最大化期望奖励），但评估却依赖风险寻求指标（如Pass@k和Max@k），导致性能不佳。

Method: RSPO通过利用闭式概率计算某响应在k次采样中为最大值的概率，解决了低奖励响应因与高奖励响应共存而被错误强化的问题。

Result: RSPO生成了高效且无偏的梯度估计器，并通过理论和实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: RSPO成功弥合了训练目标与评估指标之间的风险偏好差距，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

Motivation: 现代神经网络依赖单调激活函数（如ReLU），需要大量参数逼近复杂函数。PLU旨在通过周期性非单调性提升表达能力和参数效率。

Result: 实验表明，仅含两个PLU神经元的最小MLP能解决螺旋分类任务，而传统激活函数无法实现。

Conclusion: PLU标志着从分段泰勒近似到傅里叶式函数合成的范式转变，显著提升了参数效率。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

TL;DR: GOODIE是一个结合标签传播和特征传播的混合框架，用于处理图神经网络中节点特征缺失的问题，通过注意力机制和对比学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在节点特征缺失时性能下降的问题，尤其是在特征极少的情况下，现有方法表现不佳。

Method: 结合标签传播和特征传播分支，设计GNN解码器对齐嵌入，引入结构-特征注意力机制和伪标签对比学习。

Result: GOODIE在特征缺失和丰富情况下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE通过混合框架和注意力机制，有效提升了特征缺失图数据的处理能力。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算子方法需要大量训练数据且无法跨PDE家族泛化，MOFS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多任务自监督预训练、文本条件算子嵌入和记忆增强多模态提示，采用两阶段训练范式。

Result: 在Darcy Flow和Navier Stokes等基准测试中，MOFS在少样本泛化上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MOFS为跨科学领域的通用和数据高效算子学习提供了新基础。

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦无监督学习方法在非独立同分布数据和去中心化环境下，难以实现全局均匀性，影响了表征质量。

Method: 提出了SSD方法，通过软分离和蒸馏模块，减少客户端模型聚合时的干扰，同时引入投影器蒸馏模块以优化表征质量。

Result: 在跨机构和跨设备的联邦设置中，SSD显著提升了表征质量和任务性能。

Conclusion: SSD有效解决了FUL中的全局均匀性问题，为联邦学习中的表征学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决元强化学习中探索与利用的平衡问题，提出无需显式探索激励，仅通过贪婪目标即可自然产生探索行为的假设。

Method: 通过实验验证三个条件（环境结构重复、代理记忆、长期信用分配）对探索行为的影响，使用随机多臂老虎机和网格世界环境。

Result: 当环境结构和代理记忆存在时，贪婪目标训练的代理表现出探索行为；移除任一条件会抑制探索。长期信用分配的缺失不一定完全阻止探索。

Conclusion: 在适当条件下，探索行为可以从统一的奖励最大化过程中自然产生，无需显式处理探索与利用的冲突。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，FedCD优于五种FL方法，实现了精确且公平的诊断。

Conclusion: FedCD有效解决了隐私保护和公平性问题，为分布式学习数据诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Conclusion: GraphVSSM不仅提升了区域灾害韧性评估，还为全球灾害风险减少提供了新工具，同时为城市研究中的弱监督数据分析提供了方法支持。

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Method: 研究采用标准PINN和反向兼容PINN（BC-PINN）训练方法，通过放松物理约束和动态加权损失函数来优化性能。

Result: 在2D层流和3D湍流案例中，PINN模型成功从稀疏数据中重建流场，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PINNs在稀疏数据和复杂流场条件下具有潜力，为工程应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KFCV方法计算量大且数据洗牌频繁，影响泛化评估；SRS虽提供代表性样本，但在不平衡数据中表现不佳。FSV旨在减少偏差并融合两者的优点。

Method: FSV结合SRS和KFCV，引入加权因子优化性能。实验使用三个数据集（10K、50K、100K样本），通过KFCV（5折10次重复）和FSV进行评估。

Result: FSV在ME、VE、MSE、偏差、ROC_ME和ROC_VE等指标上均优于SRS和KFCV，表现更准确可靠。

Conclusion: FSV在资源受限和大数据集场景下提供高效的数据分区解决方案，适用于机器学习实践。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Motivation: 在深度强化学习中，训练策略时状态和动作分布的变化可能导致性能次优甚至崩溃，因此需要评估优化限制。

Method: 提出了一种实用性次优性估计器，通过实验验证其在多种环境和RL算法中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，生成的最佳经验与策略学习性能之间的差距为2-3倍，表明深度RL方法仅利用了一半的好经验。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习算法在优化方面存在显著限制，未来改进需关注如何更有效地利用生成的经验。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Conclusion: 论文为LoRA-based FL的聚合策略提供了理论基础，并证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效数值积分提供了新思路，尤其适用于非奇异相互作用核和库仑相互作用核的情况。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

Result: 内存容量随输入空间分离度指数增长，特征相关性轻微降低容量，高阶特征交互影响更显著。

Conclusion: 研究为DAM的理论与实践搭建桥梁，可能启发更多以数据为中心的方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用深度学习和机器学习模型预测XRP/USDT交易对的收盘价，并引入了流动性代理指标（VVR和VWAP）以提高预测准确性。LSTM模型表现最佳，强调了流动性对预测的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场快速增长，但价格预测面临挑战，尤其是现有模型常忽略市场流动性这一关键因素。

Method: 开发了四种机器学习模型（线性回归、随机森林、XGBoost和LSTM），分别在不包含和包含流动性代理指标（VVR和VWAP）的情况下进行训练和评估。

Result: LSTM模型在所有情况下表现最佳，流动性指标的加入显著提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: 市场流动性是预测加密货币价格的关键因素，未来模型应纳入流动性指标以提高预测效果。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Result: 实验表明，UniExtreme在极端和一般天气预测中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniExtreme展示了在多样化极端场景中的优越适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Result: 在32个基准数据集上评估，该方法显著优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了不平衡回归问题，无需预设阈值，数据驱动性强。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AI合成规划系统的效率，更适用于高通量筛选和用户体验。

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Conclusion: 历史标记有效解决了Transformer的局限性，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet具有优秀的泛化能力，适合实际应用，未来将探索更多混沌映射。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

Result: 发现冷却形状影响模型的偏差-方差权衡，且较高的β2值在冷却阶段带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 优化冷却阶段配置对Transformer训练至关重要，需与传统超参数调优结合。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列编辑器依赖预定义属性向量，缺乏灵活性和可控性，限制了编辑范围和用户友好性。

Method: 引入基于指令的时间序列编辑，通过多模态表示空间嵌入时间和指令，解码生成编辑后的时间序列，支持多分辨率编码处理局部和全局编辑。

Conclusion: InstructTime是一种先进的、灵活的时间序列编辑方法，通过自然语言指令实现广泛且可控的编辑。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashSVD是一种新型的端到端秩感知流式推理框架，专为SVD压缩的大型语言模型设计，显著减少峰值激活内存和中间瞬态内存，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于SVD的压缩技术虽然减少了模型参数的存储需求，但在推理过程中忽略了激活内存的开销，导致峰值内存未减少，限制了实际部署的可行性。

Method: FlashSVD通过将低秩投影内核直接融合到自注意力和前馈网络管道中，避免生成全尺寸激活缓冲区，动态加载和计算截断因子的小块，减少内存占用。

Result: 在BERT-Base等基准测试中，FlashSVD将峰值激活内存减少70.2%，中间瞬态内存减少75%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩大型语言模型在内存受限环境中的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

Motivation: 现实时间序列具有强周期性，但现有深度学习模型因频谱偏差和缺乏频率感知先验而难以捕捉这些模式。

Method: 使用FFT引导的坐标下降提取低频成分，初始化正弦嵌入，并采用双速学习计划保持频率结构。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优异，尤其在长期预测中；合成数据中能准确恢复真实频率。

Conclusion: 频谱先验的引入提升了深度时间模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

Result: 原型与临床结果显著相关，且在非心脏疾病（如败血症和肾病）中也表现出预测性能（AUC 0.89-0.91）。

Conclusion: 原型模型支持从生理时间序列数据中进行可解释的数字表型分析，捕捉超出原始训练目标的临床相关生理特征。

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

*Jingyi Chen,Xinyuan Zhang,Xinwu Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督图神经网络的概率方法，用于解决带负权环的基本最短路径问题（ESPP），并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于负权环的存在，ESPP问题变得NP难，传统方法难以高效求解。本文旨在通过概率方法找到近似最优解。

Method: 使用无监督图神经网络联合学习节点值估计和边选择概率，通过替代损失函数减少负权环并嵌入算法对齐。推断时通过解码算法将边概率转化为基本路径。

Result: 在多达100个节点的图上，该方法优于无监督基线和经典启发式算法，且在未见过的合成图上表现出良好的跨规模和跨拓扑泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的概率方法在解决ESPP问题上具有高效性和泛化性，为复杂图问题提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLP的方法忽视了时间序列建模所需的层次局部性和序列归纳偏置，性能提升有限。KAN因其自适应基函数的优势，可能成为新的建模核心。

Method: 提出KANMixer架构，结合多尺度混合主干，充分利用KAN的自适应能力。

Result: 在7个基准数据集的28个实验中，KANMixer在16个实验中表现最优。分析表明KAN的自适应能力显著改变了网络结构对预测性能的影响。

Conclusion: KANMixer展示了KAN在LTSF中的潜力，并提供了实际应用指南，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

Motivation: 联邦学习在数据异构性高时表现不佳，需要个性化解决方案。

Method: 动态聚类算法，基于模型差异度量数据异构性，利用训练损失曲线调整分组结构，采用分层聚合机制减少通信成本。

Result: 显著减少训练时间并提高模型准确性。

Conclusion: DC-PFL有效解决数据异构性问题，提升联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

and data reconstruction, integrated sensing and communication, resource
management in edge computing networks, semantic communications and other
notable issues. We conclude the survey with highlighting technical limitations
of DMs and their applications, as well as discussing future research
directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Method: 通过理论分析，揭示了去噪分数匹配目标的异方差性，并推导了广义任意阶损失的最优加权函数。特别关注一阶形式在扩散模型中的应用。

Result: 研究发现，常用启发式加权函数是最优加权的一阶泰勒近似，且在参数梯度上可能具有更低方差，有助于更稳定高效的训练。

Conclusion: 本文为去噪分数匹配提供了理论支持，并展示了启发式加权的实际优势，为扩散模型的训练提供了新见解。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Motivation: 解决多数据流学习中的异质性和概念漂移问题，现有方法假设流同质且静态架构限制了泛化能力。

Method: CAMEL为每个流分配独立系统和专用特征提取器，动态专家池捕获流特定模式，协作专家通过注意力机制整合上下文，AET策略动态管理专家生命周期。

Result: 实验表明CAMEL在多流学习中具有优越的泛化能力和对复杂概念漂移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAMEL通过动态协作和专家级可塑性，有效解决了多数据流学习的挑战。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Result: 在多个数学测试集上表现优异，超越O1-Preview，与O1-mini相当。

Conclusion: EPRLI算法在开源框架下实现了与商业模型相当的推理能力，为研究社区提供了可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large

draw out complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs, such as those in the OpenAI O series, Claude 3 series,
DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 series, and Grok 3 series, remain undisclosed, making it

Motivation: 解决强化学习中因数据质量差或错误行为导致的“垃圾进，垃圾出”问题，提升模型决策的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: ARL框架包含两个外部代理：一个实时评估模型决策并提供反馈（Rejected Data Pipeline），另一个选择性筛选反馈生成高质量训练数据（Approved Dataset）。

Result: 实验表明，结合人类反馈显著提升了模型在复杂环境中的决策能力，特别是在“文档识别与信息提取”任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ARL框架结合机器效率和人类洞察力，为数据驱动应用提供了一种可扩展的性能提升方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模高质量EHR数据的稀缺性限制了生物医学研究，尤其是在传统中医（TCM）领域。现有方法难以处理多模态数据的复杂性和不完整性。

Method: TCDiff框架通过三阶段扩散网络（参考模态扩散、跨模态桥接和目标模态扩散）生成高保真EHR数据。

Result: 实验表明，TCDiff在数据保真度上平均优于现有方法10%，同时保持隐私性。

Conclusion: TCDiff在真实医疗场景中展现出高效性、鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

Result: IMU在视觉和语言任务中表现优于现有无保留数据方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单高效的无保留数据机器遗忘方法，显著提升遗忘效果并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少内存使用并提升推理速度，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: EAC-MoE有效解决了MoE-LLMs的关键挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Motivation: 微服务架构的分布式特性带来了性能监控和资源管理的挑战，传统方法依赖的请求延迟指标对瞬时噪声敏感且无法全面反映复杂并发工作负载的行为。

Method: USRFNet采用图神经网络（GNN）捕捉服务交互和请求传播模式，同时使用gMLP模块独立建模集群资源动态，最后融合为统一系统嵌入以预测P95延迟。

Result: 在真实微服务基准测试中，USRFNet在大规模压力测试条件下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: USRFNet通过分离和整合流量侧与资源侧特征，为微服务架构提供了一种高效的性能监控和资源管理解决方案。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了安全推理的通信和计算开销，同时保护了量化参数的隐私，为隐私敏感领域的模型部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

*Minsuk Jang,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPARTA框架利用脉冲时序信息实现高效稀疏注意力，将注意力复杂度从O(N^2)降至O(K^2)，并在多个数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SNN主要依赖速率编码，忽视了脉冲时序信息，SPARTA旨在利用这些信息提升计算效率和准确性。

Method: SPARTA通过竞争门控机制，基于脉冲时序特征（如发放模式、脉冲间隔）选择最显著token，实现65.4%的稀疏性。

Result: 在DVS-Gesture上达到98.78%准确率，CIFAR10-DVS和CIFAR-10上分别为83.06%和95.3%。

Conclusion: 利用脉冲时序动态可同时提升计算效率和模型准确性。

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了模型异构联邦学习的性能，同时降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

Result: 实验验证了方法在异步、异构和非凸场景下的性能和可扩展性提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的联邦学习提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法为广义核化赌博机提供紧致的遗憾保证，因此需要新的理论和算法。

Method: 提出GKB-UCB算法，并设计了一种新的自归一化Bernstein不等式用于分析。

Result: 证明了GKB-UCB的遗憾界为$\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$，与现有最优结果一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为核化赌博机和广义线性赌博机提供了统一的理论框架。

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中表格数据的表示问题，特别是为Transformers和LLMs提供一种统一且结构保留的编码方法。

Method: 结合预定义固定标记和基于BPE的子词词汇，分别处理结构元素、低基数分类特征以及高基数和连续值。

Result: 在CIDDS-001数据集上高效处理了3100万网络流，压缩比为6.18:1，生成了10亿标记的语料库。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构化数据训练基础模型提供了可行且通用的途径。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

TL;DR: PHAR框架将时间序列分类模型的特征归因转化为结构化、可读的规则，提升模型透明度，并在覆盖率和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列分类模型解释性差的问题，尤其是高维输入空间和原始时间序列难以解释的挑战。

Method: PHAR将后验特征归因（如LIME、SHAP）转化为结构化规则，通过规则融合步骤优化覆盖、置信度和简洁性。

Result: 在UCI数据集上，PHAR提升了模型解释性、决策透明度和实际应用性。

Conclusion: PHAR为时间序列分类提供了一种高效、可解释的规则生成方法，解决了Rashomon现象带来的冲突解释问题。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

Result: 在多个基准问题（如随机倒立摆、钟摆和高维LQR问题）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PINN-PI框架在随机环境中扩展了确定性方法，并继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR成功解决了数据不平衡和计算效率问题，为条件生成模型提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，OccamVTS在多个基准数据集上表现最优，参数仅需1%，在少样本和零样本场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过蒸馏提取关键参数可显著提升时间序列预测性能，同时减少模型复杂度。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient

gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了异步去中心化联邦学习（DFL）中客户端持续退出的问题，提出了基于客户端重构的自适应策略，以恢复因退出导致的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步和去中心化使得联邦学习中对模型更新的信息模糊，导致客户端退出时难以恢复。现有方法无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了基于客户端重构的自适应策略，结合局部正则化的异步DFL方法。

Result: 实验表明，这些策略能有效恢复部分性能损失，并在不同数据分布场景下保持联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 虽然无法精确重构缺失客户端的数据，但自适应策略仍能有效应对客户端退出问题，未来需进一步研究其局限性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: TD2C在合成数据和真实基准测试中表现优异，尤其在非线性和高维场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TD2C为复杂系统中的因果发现提供了鲁棒且可扩展的新工具。

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PCPO的新方法，通过预惩罚机制和约束感知奖励改进安全强化学习中的约束优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Lagrangian方法在处理约束优化问题时可能导致振荡和超调，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: PCPO结合了预惩罚机制（通过屏障项在策略接近边界时施加成本）和约束感知内在奖励（仅在策略接近约束边界时激活）。

Result: PCPO在实验中表现出显著稳定性，并提供了理论上的对偶间隙和性能上下界。

Conclusion: PCPO框架为约束下的策略优化提供了稳健解决方案，对未来研究和实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型内部表示修改对生成内容的控制效果，提出了一种统一的干预检测框架（ID），揭示了线性可控性在训练过程中的动态变化。


<details>

Motivation: 探索语言模型内部表示修改对生成内容（如情感、风格或真实性）的控制效果，并明确干预的有效条件。

Method: 提出干预检测框架（ID），通过隐藏状态和表示分析揭示线性可控性的动态变化，并引入ID相关指标（如热图、熵趋势和余弦相似度）进行解释。

Result: 研究发现，线性可控性在训练的中期阶段出现，且相关概念（如愤怒和悲伤）的可控性出现时间不同。ID显示，随着训练进行，概念在隐藏空间中线性可分性增强，与线性可控性密切相关。

Conclusion: ID框架为理解语言模型训练过程中线性可控性的动态变化提供了有效工具，且适用于不同模型家族，验证了其通用性。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）的持续预训练方法，通过经验回放和梯度对齐技术解决新数据引入时的分布偏移问题，证明了这些方法的有效性，并提出了高效的元经验回放（MER）实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM训练在新数据可用时需要从头开始预训练，效率低下且资源浪费。持续预训练是一种更高效的方法，但新数据会导致分布偏移和性能下降。

Method: 研究了经验回放和梯度对齐两种方法，并在Llama架构家族上进行了大规模持续预训练实验，涉及1000亿标记的多语言数据。

Result: 实验表明，经验回放和梯度对齐都能稳定学习且避免遗忘。梯度对齐在LLM预训练中首次被证明有效，并提出了一种高效的MER实现。

Conclusion: 小比例回放旧样本比增加模型规模更高效，但增加模型规模比高比例回放更节省计算资源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Method: 提出邻居距离最小化（NDM）方法，无监督学习非基对齐的子空间，并通过定性和定量实验验证其有效性。

Result: 定性分析显示子空间可解释性强，定量实验证明子空间与GPT-2电路变量有强关联，且方法可扩展到20亿参数模型。

Conclusion: NDM为理解模型内部表示和构建电路提供了新视角，展示了无监督方法在发现自然子空间中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Result: 实验显示，DB-RPNI比现有方法快三个数量级，并能推断最小正确自动机。

Conclusion: DB-RPNI为部分可观测环境中的策略学习提供了高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

Result: 在1000个断路器的合成网络中，OptiGridML将功率输出提升18%，推理时间从小时级缩短至毫秒级。

Conclusion: 结构化、流感知的GNN在物理网络系统的组合优化中具有加速潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

Motivation: 主动特征获取是一个实例级的序列决策问题，现有方法如强化学习训练困难，而贪婪策略则过于短视。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在大量合成和真实数据集上的评估表明，该方法显著优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的潜在变量模型方法在主动特征获取任务中表现优异，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模预训练语言模型在多任务微调中参数效率和表达性的需求。

Method: 使用Kronecker积分解线性更新，并通过低秩LoRA分解进一步压缩参数。

Result: 在DistilBERT和Mistral-7B上，Kron-LoRA以更少参数匹配或超越标准LoRA性能，并支持量化。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA为多任务适配提供了一种可扩展、可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构化数据和无结构临床笔记的两阶段框架，用于临床风险预测，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用电子健康记录（EHRs）中的多模态数据（结构化数据和无结构临床笔记）进行临床结果预测，以支持早期干预和资源优化。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1）使用微调的大型语言模型（LLM）从临床笔记中提取关键信息，并结合图检索的外部医学知识；2）整合无结构表示和结构化数据特征进行最终预测。

Result: 在30天再入院和院内死亡率预测任务中，AUC分别达到0.84和0.92，优于现有基线方法和临床实践。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合LLM和图检索的外部知识，显著提升了临床预测的准确性，为医疗预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

TL;DR: KAFNet是一种基于CPA的紧凑架构，用于不规则多元时间序列预测，通过模块化设计提升性能并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不规则多元时间序列（IMTS）建模因采样不均和变量异步性而具有挑战性，现有方法如CPA存在计算开销大的问题，而图模型难以捕捉全局相关性。

Method: 提出KAFNet，结合预卷积模块、时间核聚合模块和频率线性注意力块，优化CPA处理并提升效率。

Result: 实验显示KAFNet在多个IMTS数据集上性能最优，参数减少7.2倍，训练推理加速8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet证明了CPA在IMTS建模中的有效性，并通过模块化设计显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Result: 在三个真实数据集和五种流行推荐系统模型上的实验表明，DLDA比现有攻击方法更能推广目标物品且更难被检测。

Conclusion: 现代推荐系统比以往认知的更脆弱，亟需更强大的防御措施。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了方法能显著减小模型规模和计算开销，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的剪枝和补偿策略有效构建了高效且高性能的脉冲Transformer模型。

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Conclusion: GRAD通过生成模型和专家混合模块，有效解决了自动竞价中的关键挑战，满足了现代广告主的多样化需求，并在实际应用中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and
10.68% increase in ROI.

Motivation: 背景车辆（BVs）的驾驶行为模型对生成安全关键场景至关重要，尤其是其协作对抗特性。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练双模态驾驶员模型（Dual-DM），并在连续模拟交通环境中生成复杂多样的安全关键场景。

Result: Dual-DM在保持场景保真度和复杂性的同时，生成效率显著提升（效率指标提高195%），且场景多样性得到验证。

Conclusion: Dual-DM通过演化场景生成方法，显著提升了安全关键场景的生成性能。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

Conclusion: 提出可推广的证据标准，用于校准定性研究中的AI判断。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Conclusion: 该框架为无源数据迁移学习提供了实用解决方案，扩展了迁移学习的应用场景。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net为未来流行病防控提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Conclusion: MolReasoner实现了从记忆到化学推理的转变，为分子领域提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: 为高效时空建模建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

TL;DR: AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL) 是一个用于在微调大语言模型时保持对齐性的框架，通过多种正则化方法减少对齐漂移，提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA 微调可能导致对齐漂移，削弱模型的安全性和行为约束，因此需要一种方法来保持对齐性。

Method: AGL 结合了主任务损失、Fisher 信息矩阵正则化、任务特定正则化和碰撞感知正则化（包括黎曼重叠和测地分离）。

Result: AGL 在安全关键基准上减少了对齐漂移达 50%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AGL 是一种结构化的 LoRA 改进方法，能有效保持对齐性，同时开源实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

TL;DR: CRINN是一种新的近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）算法范式，通过强化学习优化执行速度，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS算法在AI应用中日益重要，特别是在检索增强生成（RAG）和基于代理的LLM应用中，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 将ANNS优化视为强化学习问题，以执行速度作为奖励信号，自动生成更快且满足精度约束的ANNS实现。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的NNS基准数据集上，CRINN在三个数据集上表现最佳，两个数据集上并列第一。

Conclusion: CRINN的成功不仅验证了强化学习在ANNS优化中的有效性，还展示了LLM与强化学习结合在自动化复杂算法优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了连续时间强化学习（CTRL）在不同问题难度下的适应性，提出了一种基于最大似然估计（MLE）的模型算法，通过估计状态边际密度来指导学习，并证明了其性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CTRL在动态环境中适应不同问题难度的能力，填补现有研究中对这一行为理解的空白。

Method: 提出了一种基于MLE的模型算法，通过估计状态边际密度而非直接估计系统动态来指导学习，并引入随机测量计划以提高样本效率。

Result: 证明了算法的性能保证，其遗憾界限与总奖励方差和测量分辨率相关，且在适当调整观测频率时与具体测量策略无关。

Conclusion: 该算法为设计能根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

TL;DR: 研究使用LSTM神经网络评估大型卡车在工作区合并的风险，提出基于风险预测的合并策略，相比基线方法显著降低冲突风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型卡车因体积和盲区易在工作区引发事故，需优化其合并行为以提升安全性。

Method: 采用LSTM神经网络预测合并风险，并与概率风险、50%和85%分位间隙基线方法对比。

Result: LSTM方法降低冲突风险（TET和TIT值更低），支持动态合并而非完全停止。

Conclusion: LSTM方法有效提升大型卡车工作区合并安全性，优于传统策略。

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

TL;DR: PTBCC提出了一种基于原型学习的贝叶斯分类器组合方法，解决了传统混淆矩阵方法在数据稀疏和类别不平衡时的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据稀疏或类别不平衡时表现不佳，且单一混淆矩阵难以全面捕捉标注者的专业知识模式。

Method: PTBCC通过原型学习引入一组原型混淆矩阵，将标注者的专业知识建模为这些原型的Dirichlet先验分布。

Result: 在11个真实数据集上，PTBCC最高提升15%准确率，平均提升3%，同时降低90%以上计算成本。

Conclusion: PTBCC通过原型学习实现了更可靠和灵活的标注者建模，显著提升了分类性能并降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Motivation: 现代深度网络的训练动态缺乏理论理解，本文旨在通过结构设计来改善学习系统的收敛性、泛化性和适应性。

Method: 采用一种包含约束路径和自适应校正的变换层，分析其对梯度流、谱敏感性和固定点行为的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和结构化任务中提高了鲁棒性、优化平滑性和深度可扩展性。

Conclusion: 结构设计不仅是性能调优，更是塑造可扩展和可信赖神经网络学习动态的关键因素。

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Result: 在多种模型和稀疏比下，Amber Pruner能加速55%以上的线性计算，且在下游任务中保持高性能。

Conclusion: Amber Pruner为激活稀疏开辟了新方向，为下一代AI系统的算法与架构设计提供了基础。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FedLAD的新型防御方法，通过线性代数优化检测恶意节点，有效对抗联邦学习中的Sybil攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击对联邦学习构成重大威胁，恶意节点可能占据多数，破坏系统安全，因此需要开发有效的防御措施。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性代数优化问题，通过提取独立的线性组合来识别和过滤恶意节点。

Result: 实验表明，FedLAD在恶意节点比例为0.2至0.8时保持低攻击成功率，在0.2至0.5时保持高模型准确性，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: FedLAD能显著提升联邦学习系统在数据投毒攻击下的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，填补了结构预测与治疗发现之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between
structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

Conclusion: RKD-SC框架为高效且鲁棒的语义通信提供了一种可行方案，解决了LSM部署中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

Motivation: 轨迹数据包含全局和局部时间信息，且用户行为发生在不同时间尺度，增加了提取完整时间模式和行为模式的难度。

Method: 使用MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN提取局部时间信息，并通过CA融合两者。MSCNN采用不同大小的卷积核以捕捉多分辨率时间信息。

Conclusion: 该模型通过结合全局和局部时间信息，有效提高了轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

Motivation: 个人贷款平台中优化信用额度、利率和贷款期限对管理借款风险和终身价值至关重要，但现有方法难以处理连续多维处理且缺乏领域知识约束。

Method: 利用双机器学习（DML）框架，通过去偏观测数据、处理任意维度的连续处理，并强制处理与结果之间的单调约束。

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML框架在连续多维处理的因果效应估计中表现出色，并满足金融领域的单调性要求。

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过聚合多个小型专业化语言模型的输出来提高响应质量的方法，解决了大型语言模型在数据和资源需求上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在训练数据、计算资源和能源消耗方面的高需求限制了其实际部署，因此需要探索替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种网络化LLM系统，由多个用户、中央任务处理器和专业化LLM集群组成，通过路由查询和聚合响应来优化结果。

Result: 模拟实验表明，聚合响应的准确性显著高于单个LLM，尤其是在参与模型的独立性能相近时。

Conclusion: 聚合小型专业化LLM的输出是一种有效提升响应质量的方法，尤其在资源受限的场景下。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Conclusion: LeanK在不牺牲准确性的情况下优化了LLM的效率，并提供了对长上下文推理中模型通道和注意力头的深入分析。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into
model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing
the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多策略帕累托前沿跟踪（MPFT）框架，解决了传统多目标强化学习方法样本效率低和计算资源消耗大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多策略方法依赖在线强化学习和进化框架，导致样本效率低和计算资源消耗大。

Method: MPFT框架包括四个阶段：近似帕累托顶点策略、设计帕累托跟踪机制、填充稀疏区域、组合策略近似帕累托前沿。

Result: 在七个连续动作机器人控制任务上，MPFT表现出优于现有方法的超体积性能，显著减少了交互和硬件需求。

Conclusion: MPFT框架为多目标强化学习提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分割学习（SL）在恶意客户端攻击下的脆弱性问题，保障模型准确性和隐私保护。

Method: 将客户端分为N+1个集群，独立训练并评估验证损失，仅保留损失最低的集群；Pigeon-SL+通过重复训练提升效率。

Result: 在标签翻转、激活和梯度操纵三种攻击模型下，Pigeon-SL显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL为未来智能无线网络提供了一种高效、安全的分布式学习方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的通用最短路径搜索框架，通过构建骨架图和SGNN学习节点嵌入，结合LSearch和HLSearch算法，在多种图上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法（如Dijkstra和A*）在大规模复杂图上效率低，而基于索引的方法需要大量预处理和存储。现有学习方法依赖特定领域特征，通用性不足。

Method: 构建骨架图捕获多级距离和跳数信息，使用SGNN学习节点嵌入并预测距离和跳数，结合LSearch和HLSearch算法进行高效搜索。

Result: 在五种真实图上实验表明，该框架性能优越，适用于多种图类型。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于学习的最短路径搜索提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Motivation: 解决资源受限边缘设备上部署大规模神经网络的问题，通过剪枝减少计算和内存开销。

Result: 在ImageNet等数据集和VGG等架构上验证，FAIR-Pruner显著压缩模型同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner提供了一种高效、自动化的剪枝方法，适用于不同剪枝比例，且无需微调。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: 高质量的合成数据可在保护商业机密的同时支持航空分析，但需对预战术预测准确性保持现实预期。

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度信用分配和投票机制，显著提升了RLVR的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: NMS是首个能有效解决泛化问题和DDR能耗问题的DNN-free近内存采样技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

*Wenyuan Liu,Haoqian Meng,Yilun Luo,Peng Zhang,Xindian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroMix是一种混合精度量化算法和矩阵乘法内核，专为Blackwell架构设计，支持MXFP4、MXFP6和MXFP8通道的任意组合，显著提升LLMs的推理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有INT4内核无法充分利用Blackwell架构FP4 Tensor Cores的问题，以提升量化模型的性能和效率。

Method: 提出MicroMix算法和内核，结合Microscaling数据格式，通过量化阈值动态分配不同精度通道，平衡准确性和计算效率。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优异，比TensorRT-FP8快20%，并显著降低预填充延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: MicroMix在Blackwell架构上实现了高效且准确的量化推理，为LLMs的部署提供了新方案。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的切片技术，用于Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) 和融合扩展 (FGW) 距离，显著降低计算负担，同时保持等距不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW和FGW距离的计算具有挑战性，现有的切片版本受限于欧几里得几何且失去等距不变性。

Method: 基于下界、分层最优传输和适当的1D OT积分规则，提出新的切片技术。

Result: 新方法显著减少计算量，保持等距不变性，并能比较任意几何形状。

Conclusion: 新切片距离在形状检索和图同构测试中比原始GW和FGW更稳健可靠。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

Motivation: 传统强化学习在交易决策中存在短视行为和不透明的策略逻辑，而LLM展现出战略推理和多模态金融信号解析能力，因此探索两者结合的可能性。

Method: 通过LLM生成高级交易策略，并指导RL代理执行具体操作，同时评估LLM策略的合理性和RL代理的性能指标（如夏普比率和最大回撤）。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM引导的RL代理在收益和风险指标上优于标准RL方法。

Conclusion: LLM与RL的混合系统能够有效提升交易决策的长期表现，同时提供更透明的策略逻辑。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Llama3-8B上，PPF显著降低困惑度（动态剪枝33.4%，静态剪枝84.78%），预测误差<0.0011，评估延迟从分钟级降至秒级。

Conclusion: PPF高效解决了动态剪枝和策略评估的瓶颈，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

Conclusion: GEFRFE通过引入分数域，有效增强了嵌入信息的表达能力，为图表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端可能因技术问题、不利数据或恶意攻击发送故障更新，导致全局模型性能下降，现有防御机制依赖不切实际的先验知识。

Method: 提出ASMR方法，基于角度距离动态排除故障客户端，无需超参数或故障客户端数量信息。

Result: 在组织病理学数据集上的图像分类任务中验证了ASMR的检测能力，并展示了动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR是一种无需先验知识的实用方法，能有效提升联邦学习对故障客户端的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Motivation: 由于缺乏真实数据，评估3D医学生成模型的质量具有挑战性，且现有指标无法满足医学领域对个体形状质量的需求。

Method: 通过采样点云数据并提取几何特征，训练监督ML和PointNet模型，分类生成肝脏形状的好坏。

Result: ML分类器不仅能提供可解释的反馈，还能补充专家评估的不足。

Conclusion: ML分类器可作为轻量级、任务相关的质量评估工具，支持医学形状建模的透明和临床对齐评估。

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Result: 提出的方法显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，能够有效减少标签噪声并提升医学图像分析的性能。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

Result: SplitMe在成本和收敛性能上显著优于SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed等框架。

Conclusion: SplitMe有效解决了O-RAN中联邦学习的资源分配和收敛问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

Motivation: PINNs在解决PDE时面临不规则边界导致的归一化不一致、边界条件不准确和损失项不平衡等问题，传统方法适应性有限。

Method: JacobiNet通过轻量级MLP学习连续可微的坐标变换，支持自动微分计算雅可比矩阵，并与PINNs无缝集成。

Conclusion: JacobiNet有效解决了PINNs的边界和归一化问题，展示了其泛化能力、高精度和高效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模系统比较XAI方法，揭示了GradCAM和Layer-wise Relevance Propagation在神经影像数据中的局限性，并推荐SmoothGrad作为更可靠的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证XAI方法在神经影像中的可靠性，避免误解和错误解释。

Method: 使用45,000张结构脑MRI，构建已知信号源的预测任务，验证XAI方法的性能。

Result: GradCAM无法定位预测特征，Layer-wise Relevance Propagation产生虚假解释，而SmoothGrad表现稳定。

Conclusion: XAI方法需针对神经影像数据适配和验证，现有研究结果需重新评估，推荐使用SmoothGrad。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

*Javier Fumanal-Idocin,Raquel Fernandez-Peralta,Javier Andreu-Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的系统用于动态特征选择（DFS），提高了决策的可解释性，并展示了其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态特征选择方法使用不透明模型，限制了在需要决策透明性的场景（如临床决策）中的应用。

Method: 采用基于规则的系统作为DFS的基础分类器，提供特征选择的不确定性量化，并优化计算效率。

Result: 该方法在性能上与现有贪婪和强化学习方法竞争，同时提供了更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法在透明性和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于需要高解释性的场景。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

Motivation: 现有PEFT策略未能利用MoE的动态路由机制，因此研究是否应在适配模块中引入路由机制以匹配MoE的多专家架构。

Method: 分析PEFT应用于MoE语言模型时的核心组件动态，并研究不同路由策略对适配效果的影响。

Result: 在OLMoE-1B-7B和Mixtral-8x7B上的实验验证了路由方法的性能和效率，并确定了不同场景下的最优配置。

Conclusion: 研究为PEFT和MoE的应用提供了实用见解，促进了更好的适配策略设计。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据通常表现出复杂的几何异质性，现有几何GNN难以适应这种多样性。

Method: ARGNN通过学习节点局部几何的黎曼度量张量场，并引入Ricci流启发的正则化以确保几何稳定性和训练稳定性。

Result: ARGNN在多种基准数据集上表现出优越性能，并能自适应地捕捉多样结构。

Conclusion: ARGNN不仅统一了现有固定或混合曲率GNN，还提供了可解释的几何洞察，验证了理论分析。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据在低数据场景下生成质量低的问题，传统方法和LLMs无法满足结构依赖需求。

Method: 两阶段框架：先学习DAG结构，再用其引导LLM生成数据，确保结构完整性。

Result: 实验证明StructSynth生成的数据结构完整性和下游实用性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StructSynth在低数据场景下有效平衡隐私保护与统计保真度。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在噪声或动态不确定性下的可解释性和稳定性问题。

Method: 采用模块化的编码器-传播器-解码器结构，通过谱约束的线性Koopman算子在潜在空间学习时间动态。

Result: 在合成系统、气候、金融和电力数据集上，DeepKoopFormer在准确性、抗噪性和长期稳定性上优于LSTM和Transformer基线。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是一个灵活、可解释且鲁棒的高维动态预测框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,

for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical

Result: 学习到的核结构能产生频率相关的时间偏移，实现音乐效果。

Conclusion: 对抗训练能从少量数据中发现音频变换，为效果设计提供新方法。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的预训练计算和内存成本高昂，现有低秩和稀疏结合方法性能不佳，需要更有效的方法。

Conclusion: LOST是一种高效且性能优越的LLM预训练方法，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

Motivation: 脑肿瘤MRI分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在更大、更异构的数据集上表现不足。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）残差引导的扩散模型进行跨模态合成；2）轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态输入进行分割。

Result: 在BraTS 2021上，Dice分数93.02%，IoU 86.7%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界多中心MRI数据集中表现出更高的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析在移动设备上执行效率低下，现有模型在医学任务上表现不佳，需要一种轻量且高性能的网络。

Result: 在八个公开的2D和3D数据集上达到最优性能，包括在未见数据集上的零样本测试。

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且通用的移动医学图像分析解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at
