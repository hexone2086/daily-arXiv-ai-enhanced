Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the\ndevelopment of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating\nlarge-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While\nthese models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful\nevaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the\npace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current\ncapabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot\nmanipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by\nextending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and\nreal-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to\nrigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical\nconfidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized\ntrials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world\nexperiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more\nsuccessful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,\nusing a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,\nperformance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.\nProject page: https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/lbm1/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff08LBMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u8303\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u6210\u529f\u548c\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u6559\u6388\u590d\u6742\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002"}}

This work proposes fusing visual and\ntactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)\nrepresentation for active perception of object properties. While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the\nreal-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot\nmanipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile\nsensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In\nthese experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects\nassumed to be static and placed on the table.

However, each time such a model is trained in a\nrobotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations\nand operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to\nground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating\ngeometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this\nredundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we\nintroduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical\nframework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric\ninductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it\nprovides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric\nprimitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks\nto reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable\noperations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that\nincorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging\nits E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts\na hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action\ndecoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising\nprocess. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and\nreal-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task\nperformance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but\nalso achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model\ncompared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570\uff08PGA\uff09\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565hPGA-DP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fahPGA-DP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Projective Geometric Algebra\uff08PGA\uff09\u548cP-GATr\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff08U-Net\u6216Transformer\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u566a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0chPGA-DP\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "hPGA-DP\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u504f\u7f6e\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

Its\nsuccess remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided\nvisualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further\ncomplicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle\nplacement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems\noffer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In\nthis work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,\nfrom scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a\ndeep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a\ndepth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously\ndefine the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework\nis proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and\narteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.\nFinally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance\nwith operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity\ncommercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The\nproposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the\nfirst attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15\n\\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less\nthan or close to 1 \\textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first\nrobotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated\nplanning, scanning, and insertion.

Specifically, we\nenhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such\nas region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing\nthe layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling\nthe generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined\nrelationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines\nlayout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct\nlayout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that\narise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive\nexperimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can\ngenerate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human\naesthetics and more explainable.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLayout\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08relation-CoT\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u7d20\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\uff08\u5982\u533a\u57df\u3001\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u8ddd\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5e03\u5c40\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9012\u5f52\u5b50\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e03\u5c40\u539f\u578b\u91cd\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u5c40\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eReLayout\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5ba1\u7f8e\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6837\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLayout\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u539f\u578b\u91cd\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its dependence on\ncomputationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.\nIn parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides\ndiffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,\nbypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be\ninterpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate\ndiffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can\nintroduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we\nunify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free\ndiffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control\nobjective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals\nthe necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to\nthe true diffusion posterior.

Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing\nstrategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)\nbased on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion\nand non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to\navoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to\ncompress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the\nBunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than\nexisting methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other\nmethods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task\nto SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.", "AI": {"tldr": "GSVR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0cGSVR\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5212\u5206\u89c6\u9891\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u907f\u514d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bunny\u548cUVG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGSVR\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe800+FPS\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec52\u79d2/\u5e27\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GSVR\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Designers usually\norganize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to\nsimplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With\nthe rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in\npixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack\neditability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,\ninfluencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the\ncreation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose\nAccordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to\nconvert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining\nnonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user\nprompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct\nroles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the\nVLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods\n(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered\ndesigns, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually\nharmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.\nAdditionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element\nremoval models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers.

To address\nthis, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time\nframework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local\nmode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,\ncomputing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective\noutputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,\nhigher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local\nmode-seeking mechanism, acting as \"collective wisdom\", steers samples away from\nspurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model\nimperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures.

In the\nabsence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from\nthe available observational data. However, observational data are often\ncompatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single\nstructure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural\nuncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior\ndistribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.\nUnfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with\nthe number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose\nto circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end\nmodel: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process\n(MACE-TNP).

Vision-based pose\nestimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling\nsolution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting\nconditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,\nblooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic\nor event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,\nevent sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced\nsignal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work\naddresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion\napproach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to\nachieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique\nwas developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to\nachieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The\npipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme\nconditions that affect either channel.

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs.

Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical\nsuccess across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the\ngeneralization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring\neither graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the\nfirst learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping\nconnections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ngeneralization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest\nachievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the\nproposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification\nmaintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges\nthat support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections\nlead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a\ntwo-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified\nmatrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer.

Existing prompt-based and adapter-based\nworks have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the\nchallenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards\nunseen new classes.

To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a\nnovel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class\ngeneralization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the\nimportance of features during training to preserve general knowledge.

Finally, we inpaint the\ncore lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.\nThis proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is\nwell-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results\ndemonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and\nbrain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for\nclinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion\nhealthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for\nvalidation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize\nmultiple lesioned brain images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9006\u8f6c\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u3001\u6062\u590d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5f62\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u6838\u5fc3\u635f\u4f24\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u53d7\u635f\u548c\u53d8\u5f62\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5f62\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9006\u8f6c\u3001\u6838\u5fc3\u635f\u4f24\u533a\u57df\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f30\u8ba1\u5065\u5eb7\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9006\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Although\nvanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal\nmovement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over\nboth camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the\nunstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose\nLiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core\nprinciples: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we\nanalyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling\ndecoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced\nacross layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.\nThird, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)\nto linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a\nmodified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we\nextend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,\nunifying spatial and temporal controllability.

Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%\nrecall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through\ncontrolled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that\nreward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking\nfrequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through\nthree simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,\ncompetitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques\nreduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find\nthese trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false\npositive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,\nand experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible\nresearch in RL safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8615,247\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u8986\u76d615\u79cdRL\u73af\u5883\u548c5\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u516d\u7c7b\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u4e3a78.4%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a81.7%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e5%\u3002\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u9ed1\u5ba2\u9891\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8654.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u5ba2\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose.

In this paper, we\nintroduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,\ninteractable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a\nthree-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D\nobject meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D\nsegmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video\ndiffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable\npart masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by\nocclusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by\na dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to\nensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated\nobjects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and\nplausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated\nasset generation.

The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and\ncoordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is\nformulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring\nthe task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we\nreformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical\noffloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method\ndecouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate\noffloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the\nlocal scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.\nSimulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and\nconvergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic\nvehicular environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u4e2d\u7ee7\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8f66\u8f7d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

First, hyperparameter tuning is often\nimpractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model\nrobustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly\nfrom training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training\nmultiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a\nhigher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any\nindividual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained\nwith diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied\nindividual performance.

Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially\ndeveloped for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their\ndirect usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the\ncontext of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and\nexperimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories\n(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to\nfive established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,\nand DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods.

In this\nwork, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this\ncorresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow\nconditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat\nsources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high\nspatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often\ncomputationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face\ndifficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly\nsensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.\nTherefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)\napproach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the\ntransport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the\ngroundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a\ncity-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous\ngroundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points\nforming interacting heat plumes over long distances.

Despite their strong\nperformance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant\nreasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon\nraises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model\nautonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without\nexternal labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding\n(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free\nself-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance\nmetacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the\ngeometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant\nreasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to\nrepetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we\nfurther introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,\nCoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to\nterminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B\ndemonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%\nwhile improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the\nchallenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoRE\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790CoRE\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u5448\u73b0\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CoRE-Eval\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u7ec8\u6b62\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\uff08overthinking\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Reasoning Embedding\uff08CoRE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CoRE-Eval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u7ec8\u6b62\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08GSM8K\u3001MATH-500\u548cAIME\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cCoRE-Eval\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1113.7%\u81f333.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7ea610%\uff0c32B\u6a21\u578b\u5728AIME\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523070.0%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CoRE\u548cCoRE-Eval\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning\nphase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be\nlegible and accurately spell.

Although many existing adversarial attack\nmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm\nperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual\ncapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based\napproaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to\ninstability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on\ndiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable\nadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution\ntowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map\nto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated\nsamples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of\nnatural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but\nalso retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA\ndatasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in\nboth black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv\nachieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality.

Previous methods\nrely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to\nmisalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene\ngeometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the\naccumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in\nblurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose\nRef-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected\ncomponents to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric\nconsistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch\nrepresentation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency\nreflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo\nreflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we\nincorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness\nconstraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms\nclassical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with\nNeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)\ndriven reflection editing.

Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to\ncreate CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced\ncaptions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling\nfiner cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.\nExperiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms\nthe base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained\nconcept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original\ngeneralization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and\nVLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CultureCLIP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6587\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6CulTwin\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efaCulTwin\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03CLIP\uff0c\u751f\u6210CultureCLIP\u3002", "result": "CultureCLIP\u5728\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840CLIP\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u53475.49%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559CLIP\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548cVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cCultureCLIP\u5728\u6587\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Current approaches predominantly utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\nsemantic interpretation.
