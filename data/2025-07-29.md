Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自适应伽马校正（TAGC）的低光照图像增强模型，通过自动计算伽马值提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降（如低对比度、噪声和细节模糊）是计算机视觉中的重要挑战。

Method: 模型通过分析低光照图像的色彩亮度，计算平均色彩以确定自适应伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: TAGC模型有效提升了低光照图像质量，保持了细节、自然对比度和正确的色彩分布。

Conclusion: TAGC是处理低光照图像的高效解决方案，适用于夜间监控、医学图像增强和低光照摄影等应用。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

### [2] [Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575)
*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决医学影像数据稀缺问题的方法，通过控制深度学习网络中的前景-背景特征差异，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺是深度学习模型的主要挑战，数据合并或添加可能导致分布偏移，影响模型性能。

Method: 利用因果框架控制深度学习网络各层的前景-背景特征差异，优化特征表示。

Result: 在五个数据集（包括新贡献的超声数据集）上实现了最先进的分割性能，定性结果显示更精细的分割图。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据添加困境，提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型Transformer感知的多尺度渐进编码器-解码器网络（T-MPEDNet），用于CT扫描中肝脏和肿瘤的自动分割，解决了肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性问题，并在公开数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏和肿瘤的精确自动分割对快速诊断和治疗计划至关重要，但肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性带来了挑战。

Method: T-MPEDNet采用渐进编码器-解码器结构，结合Transformer动态注意力机制和多尺度特征，通过形态学边界细化提升分割精度。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet的肝脏和肿瘤分割DSC分别达到97.6%/89.1%和98.3%/83.3%，优于12种先进方法。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效可靠的肝脏和肿瘤自动分割框架。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

### [4] [SurgPIS: Surgical-instrument-level Instances and Part-level Semantics for Weakly-supervised Part-aware Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19592)
*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgPIS提出了一种统一的部分感知实例分割方法，用于手术器械分割，通过弱监督学习和师生框架解决了数据标注不完整的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独处理器械级实例分割或部分级语义分割，缺乏任务间的交互，限制了自动化手术的准确性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的掩码分类方法，通过部分特定查询显式链接部分与父器械实例，并提出弱监督学习策略和师生框架。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SurgPIS的有效性，在PIS、IIS、PSS和器械级语义分割中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SurgPIS通过统一的任务框架和弱监督学习，显著提升了手术器械分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLLMs的新模型支持多模态交互，引入STOM模块和VideoInfer数据集，在视频问答和分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VideoLLMs局限于文本响应，缺乏对象中心的多轮交互能力。

Method: 提出支持视觉提示的VideoLLM模型、STOM模块传播视觉提示，并构建VideoInfer数据集。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，模型在视频问答和分割任务上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 模型在多模态、对象中心的视频理解中表现出色。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

TL;DR: Exemplar Med-DETR是一种新型多模态对比检测器，通过跨注意力和迭代训练策略，显著提升了医学图像中异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中异常检测因特征表示差异和解剖结构与异常的复杂关系而具有挑战性，现有方法难以学习有效的类别特定特征。

Method: 提出Exemplar Med-DETR，利用跨注意力机制和直观的类别特定示例特征，采用迭代训练策略。

Result: 在四种公共数据集上取得最佳性能，如越南密集乳腺X光片中肿块检测mAP达0.7，钙化检测mAP达0.55。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在医学图像中实现鲁棒和通用检测系统的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

TL;DR: MIST是一个模块化的医学图像分割工具包，专注于后处理框架，支持多种自定义策略，用于BraTS 2025挑战赛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割方法缺乏标准化和可定制工具，MIST旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 扩展了MIST的后处理模块，支持多种变换（如小对象移除、形态学操作等），并可组合成用户定义策略。

Result: 评估了三种策略，展示了MIST在快速实验和优化中的有效性。

Conclusion: MIST开源且可扩展，支持医学图像分割的可重复和规模化研究。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

TL;DR: SynPAIN是一个大规模合成数据集，用于解决疼痛评估中的种族、年龄和性别多样性不足问题，并通过AI生成的面部表情验证了其临床有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决疼痛评估中因数据集多样性不足和隐私限制导致的算法偏见问题，尤其是针对老年痴呆患者等沟通受限人群。

Method: 使用商业生成AI工具创建包含多种族、年龄和性别的合成疼痛表情数据集，并通过临床验证工具评估其有效性。

Result: 合成数据表现出预期的疼痛模式，显著高于中性表情，并揭示了现有疼痛检测模型的算法偏见。数据增强还提高了真实临床数据的检测性能。

Conclusion: SynPAIN填补了疼痛评估研究的空白，提供了首个公开的多样化合成数据集，并建立了测量和减轻算法偏见的框架。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

### [9] [Efficient Learning for Product Attributes with Compact Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19679)
*Mandar Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了利用半监督学习优化视觉语言模型（VLM）的方法，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）和无标签数据提升产品属性预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手动或API标注成本高昂，监督微调视觉语言模型面临规模挑战，因此需要探索标签高效的半监督微调策略。

Method: 采用PEFT训练低秩适配器模块，利用无标签数据生成多组推理链，基于自一致性分类为偏好和非偏好链，再用DPO损失微调模型。

Result: 在12个电商领域的数据集上，基于DPO的微调显著优于监督模型，且随着无标签数据增加，性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: 通过DPO和PEFT结合，能够高效利用无标签数据提升模型性能，且计算开销小。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Method: 通过深度学习实现联合和个体方差解释（JIVE），探索了三种可行的损失函数以满足正交性和同一性约束。

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和个体变化，并在ADNI数据中发现了生物学上合理的协变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Conclusion: Co-Win能够提升自动驾驶系统的下游决策和规划能力。

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成人脸检测模型和数据集可能存在偏见，导致对某些人口群体的检测失败，引发社会、法律和伦理问题。

Method: 利用均匀分布属性标签的合成数据生成框架，评估五种先进检测器在25个受控面部属性上的偏见水平。

Result: 研究发现合成人脸检测器普遍存在偏见，且偏见的来源与训练集中面部属性的平衡性及检测器的激活图相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了合成人脸检测器偏见的根源，为未来减少偏见提供了方向。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

Motivation: 解决彩色视频中运动目标检测的挑战，特别是背景和目标同时提取的需求，以丰富标注数据集并提升深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出uQRPCA框架，利用四元数黎曼流形降低QSVD的计算复杂度，并引入CR1B方法优化背景提取，形成uQRPCA+。

Result: 实验表明uQRPCA+在运动目标检测和背景恢复任务上优于现有开源方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: uQRPCA+是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于彩色视频处理，显著提升了目标检测和背景恢复的效果。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 探索如何通过LiDAR深度信息提升立体匹配精度，尤其是在LiDAR点稀疏的情况下。

Method: 提出预填充稀疏初始视差图的简单方法，并结合早期融合中的不同预填充策略。

Result: 提出的GRAFT-Stereo方法在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LiDAR引导的立体匹配方法提供了新思路，有望激发更多有效方法。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Motivation: 解决视频实例分割中长时实例跟踪的挑战，确保对象状态的持续更新和一致性。

Method: 使用LOM显式建模对象在每帧中的存在，并通过DOA分别处理新出现和已存在的对象。

Result: 在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上达到54.0 AP，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LOMM通过创新的内存管理和对象关联策略，为视频实例分割设定了新标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

### [16] [MoFRR: Mixture of Diffusion Models for Face Retouching Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19770)
*Jiaxin Liu,Qichao Ying,Zhenxing Qian,Sheng Li,Runqi Zhang,Jian Liu,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Face Retouching Restoration (FRR)的新任务，旨在从修饰过的面部图像中恢复原始面部。通过MoFRR（混合扩散模型）方法，结合专家隔离策略，实现了对不同修饰类型和程度的有效恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上广泛使用的面部修饰技术引发了对面部图像真实性的担忧，现有方法仅关注检测修饰，而如何从修饰图像中恢复原始面部尚未解决。

Method: 提出MoFRR方法，结合稀疏激活的专家和共享专家，采用双分支结构（低频分支和高频分支）处理不同类型的修饰。

Result: 在RetouchingFFHQ++数据集上的实验表明，MoFRR在恢复原始面部方面表现出色。

Conclusion: MoFRR为解决面部修饰恢复问题提供了有效方法，特别是在处理复杂修饰操作时表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

TL;DR: MAE是一种自监督学习方法，但学习机制尚不明确。本文发现MAE早期学习基于模式的块级聚类，并提出了自引导MAE，通过内部生成掩码提升学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MAE的学习机制，并改进其随机掩码策略以提升性能。

Method: 提出自引导MAE，利用块聚类信息生成掩码，替代随机掩码。

Result: 新方法显著提升学习效果，无需外部模型或额外信息。

Conclusion: 自引导MAE在多种下游任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: HydraMamba提出了一种基于状态空间模型的点云网络，通过改进点云序列化和局部学习，解决了现有注意力机制在点云学习中的长程依赖建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在点云学习中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了点间长程依赖建模。状态空间模型（S6）因其线性复杂度和长程建模能力被引入，但现有方法在点云序列化和局部学习上仍有不足。

Method: 设计了shuffle序列化策略以适应S6的因果性，提出ConvBiS6层协同捕获局部几何和全局上下文依赖，并扩展了多头设计（MHS6）以增强建模能力。

Result: HydraMamba在对象级和场景级任务上均取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和局部学习，有效解决了点云学习中的长程依赖建模问题，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法计算复杂且成本高，不适合实时应用，且湍流抑制与目标检测分离导致效率低下。

Method: 提出JDATT框架，结合特征级（CWD和MGD）和输出级（KL散度）蒸馏策略，集成湍流抑制与目标检测模块。

Result: 在合成和真实湍流数据集上，JDATT实现了更好的视觉恢复和检测精度，同时显著减少模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT通过联合蒸馏策略，高效解决了湍流抑制和目标检测问题，适合资源受限的实时应用。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

TL;DR: TransFlow利用预训练的视频扩散模型生成逼真的光学流数据，提升视频显著目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频显著目标检测依赖运动线索，但训练数据稀缺且现有方法生成的光学流缺乏语义理解。

Method: TransFlow通过视频扩散模型从静态图像生成语义感知的光学流，模拟自然运动。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了运动知识迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow为视频显著目标检测提供了更真实的训练数据，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

<details>

Motivation: 无监督视频对象分割（VOS）的性能受限于训练数据的稀缺性，尤其是光流数据的获取困难。

Method: 提出DepthFlow方法，通过从单张图像估计深度图并转换为合成光流场，生成大量训练数据。

Result: 在公开VOS基准测试中达到新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: DepthFlow提供了一种可扩展且有效的解决方案，显著缓解了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

<details>

Motivation: 随着计算机视觉模型的快速发展，对计算资源的需求不断增加，但在资源受限的环境中部署模型时，需要更高效的架构。

Method: 通过三个方向实现目标：优化数据输入输出、改进核心神经网络架构（如受限注意力机制）、利用Normalizing Flows的自然结构。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的神经网络架构可以提高机器学习算法的效率，使其更小、更快、更经济。

Conclusion: 通过架构优化，可以在减少计算资源的同时提升模型性能，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Result: ForCenNet在四个真实基准测试中达到最新最优性能，有效校正文本行和表格边框等布局元素。

Conclusion: ForCenNet通过前景中心方法显著提升了文档图像校正的准确性，为实际应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

TL;DR: DS-Det提出了一种新的单查询范式，解决了固定查询的灵活性问题，并通过注意力解耦学习简化了解码器框架，提高了检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码器查询类型（如内容查询和位置查询）的作用未被充分探索，且固定查询数量限制了灵活性。此外，自注意力和交叉注意力之间的交互（ROT）以及查询歧义问题影响了解码器效率。

Method: 提出DS-Det，采用单查询范式将固定查询转为灵活查询，并通过注意力解耦学习简化解码器框架，解决ROT和查询歧义问题。还引入PoCoo损失以优化小目标检测。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上的实验表明，DS-Det在多种骨干模型下均表现出高效性和优越性。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过灵活查询和注意力解耦学习，显著提升了检测器的效率和性能。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

Motivation: 减少人工标注负担，利用文本到图像生成模型的潜力。

Result: 生成高质量掩码，无需预训练分割网络或提示调优。

Conclusion: SeeDiff展示了文本引导扩散模型在像素级标注任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

Motivation: 干旱地区城市洪水对基础设施和社区构成严重威胁，但传统洪水制图方法因光谱对比度低、水文动态快和城市地表异质性高而效果不佳。

Method: FM-LC框架采用三阶段流程：1) 初始多类U-Net分割；2) 针对易混淆类别的轻量级专家模型；3) 贝叶斯平滑优化边界。

Result: 在2024年迪拜暴雨事件中验证，FM-LC的F1分数平均提升29%，洪水边界显著清晰，优于传统单阶段U-Net。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架通过分层处理和优化，有效解决了干旱地区洪水制图的挑战，为应急响应和韧性规划提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

Method: Lava系统结合多臂老虎机采样、开放世界检测和长期轨迹提取，支持自然语言查询。

Result: 实验表明，Lava在查询性能上提升14% F1分数，降低0.39 MPAE，处理速度快9.6倍。

Conclusion: Lava为大规模视频数据分析提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展性问题。

Method: 采用自回归解码器转换器（AraGPT2）直接映射姿势序列到文本，结合1D CNN进行时间压缩。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，WER分数提升6.1%，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过简化流程和直接学习文本依赖，显著提升了连续手语识别的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Motivation: 解决负提示调优在增强OOD检测能力时导致的泛化性能下降问题。

Method: 结合负特征调优（NFT）和知识正则化（KR）策略，动态适应图像并分离正负特征。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，KR-NFT显著降低了FPR95，提升了ID分类和OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: KR-NFT在OOD检测和泛化性能上优于传统方法，适用于未见ID类别的场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了FineMotion数据集，用于改进文本驱动的细粒度人体运动生成任务，显著提升了MDM模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成人体运动时忽略了特定身体部位的运动及其时间安排，因此需要更详细的文本描述来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过构建FineMotion数据集，包含442,000个运动片段和95k详细段落描述，支持细粒度运动生成和编辑。

Result: 实验显示数据集显著提升了任务性能，MDM模型的Top-3准确率提高了15.3%。

Conclusion: FineMotion数据集为细粒度运动生成和编辑提供了有效支持，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

*Ye Lu,Jie Wang,Jianjun Gao,Rui Gong,Chen Cai,Kim-Hui Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SAMA的结构感知和运动自适应框架，用于姿态提升任务，通过两个关键模块（SSI和MSM）分别处理关节拓扑和运动动态，实验表明其高效且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在姿态提升任务中难以建模复杂的关节连接和统一处理运动轨迹，且忽略了运动特性的内在差异。

Method: SAMA框架包含结构感知状态集成器（SSI）和运动自适应状态调制器（MSM），分别处理关节拓扑和运动动态。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAMA以较低计算成本取得了先进结果。

Conclusion: SAMA通过结构感知和运动自适应设计，显著提升了姿态提升任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaGS框架利用3D高斯泼溅技术融合4D雷达和单目图像，实现高效3D目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合方法依赖实例提案或密集BEV网格，缺乏整体场景理解或受限于网格结构。

Method: RaGS采用级联流程：FLI初始化高斯位置，IMA融合语义和几何信息，MGF生成多级BEV特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: RaGS通过动态聚焦稀疏目标，提供灵活高效的3D目标检测方案。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

TL;DR: OW-CLIP是一个视觉分析系统，通过多模态提示调优和Crop-Smoothing技术，解决了开放世界目标检测中的数据依赖和过拟合问题，同时利用双模态数据精炼和可视化界面提升标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开放世界目标检测方法依赖大量标注数据且易过拟合，灵活性不足。OW-CLIP旨在通过数据高效训练和可视化工具解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多模态提示调优和Crop-Smoothing技术，结合双模态数据精炼（利用大语言模型和跨模态相似性）及可视化界面生成高质量标注。

Result: OW-CLIP性能达到SOTA的89%，仅需3.8%的自生成数据；在相同数据量下优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: OW-CLIP通过数据高效训练和可视化工具，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

TL;DR: DiffCode是一个基于潜在扩散增强的向量量化码本先验的统一框架，用于解决多任务医学图像恢复（MedIR）中的异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像恢复（MedIR）中不同任务的异构性导致现有方法难以处理多样化的信息损失。

Method: DiffCode通过构建任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，整合任务特定的高质量先验特征，并利用扩散模型迭代优化潜在特征分布。

Result: DiffCode在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成三个任务中，定量指标和视觉质量均表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，成功解决了多任务MedIR中的异构性问题。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

TL;DR: ATCTrack是一种新型视觉语言跟踪器，通过动态目标状态对齐的多模态线索和全面的目标-上下文特征建模，实现鲁棒跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言跟踪器（VLTs）难以动态适应目标状态变化，且在复杂长期场景中无法有效利用初始提示中的视觉和文本线索。

Method: 1. 提出时间视觉目标-上下文建模方法；2. 基于文本内容精确识别目标词，并设计上下文词校准方法；3. 在主流基准测试中进行实验。

Result: ATCTrack在主流基准测试中达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过动态对齐多模态线索和特征建模，显著提升了复杂场景下的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Result: 学生模型推理速度比教师模型快11倍，控制精度相似，计算和内存成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法在GPS缺失的室内环境中验证有效，为实时四旋翼控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

Method: 提出FedS2R框架，包含不一致性驱动的数据增强和多客户端知识蒸馏方案。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，全局模型显著优于单个客户端模型，仅比同时访问所有数据的模型低2 mIoU。

Conclusion: FedS2R在联邦学习下有效提升了合成到真实语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

Motivation: 增强视觉语言变换器中的目标定位能力，同时保持模型的轻量化和无需重新训练的特性。

Method: RCA通过抑制极端值并放大中等激活值，重新加权最终层注意力，使语义相关但被抑制的标记能够指导预测。

Result: 在15个开源VLM中，11个模型的FitAP指标提升，最高提升达26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA为多模态变换器提供了可解释性和性能提升，尤其适用于后期融合模型。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

Result: 在三个常用基准测试中达到最先进性能，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TrackAny3D为统一模型和大规模预训练模型在3D单目标跟踪领域的应用提供了启示。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSC方法依赖全批次处理，限制了计算效率和可扩展性，尤其是处理高分辨率图像时。

Method: 1. 引入记忆库保存全局特征表示，实现mini-batch训练；2. 提出无解码器的对比学习框架，替代自编码器。

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上，性能与全批次方法相当，且优于其他先进子空间聚类方法。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了DSC的计算瓶颈，提升了可扩展性和效率，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Conclusion: HumanSAM通过细粒度分类和鲁棒特征表示，显著提升了伪造视频检测的可靠性和可解释性，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Result: LLM_Control在多种预训练模型上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM_Control显著提升了复杂条件下的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

TL;DR: UniCT Depth提出了一种结合事件和图像数据的深度估计方法，通过统一CNN和Transformer建模局部和全局特征，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，事件相机数据稀疏，现有融合方法难以处理遮挡和深度差异。

Method: 提出CcViT-DA块（结合CMSA和MFSA）和DCC块，分别用于空间依赖建模和细节补偿。

Result: UniCT Depth在关键指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件和图像数据融合的挑战，提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法在零样本或少样本场景下效果有限，且忽略了优化视觉特征以聚焦局部异常。

Method: 提出AF-CLIP，通过多尺度空间聚合机制和轻量级适配器优化视觉特征，并结合可学习文本提示。

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上表现出强大的零样本检测能力，并可扩展至少样本场景。

Conclusion: AF-CLIP在异常检测任务中具有高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our
pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various
state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Motivation: 现有3D语义场景图生成方法计算量大且不支持增量处理，难以满足实时开放世界应用的需求。

Method: FROSS利用2D场景图直接映射到3D空间，并将对象表示为3D高斯分布，避免了高计算量的点云处理。

Result: 在ReplicaSSG和3DSSG数据集上的实验表明，FROSS性能优越且速度远超现有方法。

Conclusion: FROSS为实时3D语义场景图生成提供了高效解决方案，并公开了实现和数据集。

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于OCTA图像的心血管疾病（CVD）风险评估新方法，结合血管特征分析和多任务预测，提高了预测准确性和临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，现有视网膜成像方法（如眼底照片和OCT）无法捕捉关键血管特征，且现有风险评估方法仅提供高低风险分类，缺乏对相关血液因素的深入分析。

Method: 提出OCTA-CVD数据集和VAMPIRE模型，包含Mamba-Based Directional（MBD）模块捕捉血管轨迹特征，以及Information-Enhanced Morphological（IEM）模块整合血管形态知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于标准分类模型、基于OCTA的检测方法和眼科基础模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多任务预测和血管特征提取，显著提升了CVD风险评估的准确性和临床价值。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言对比模型（如CLIP和SigLIP）依赖全局表示，限制了其在密集预测任务（如定位、OCR和分割）中的效果。

Method: 构建了十亿级候选区域数据集，提出区域Transformer层提取区域语义，并设计统一区域聚类判别损失，支持对象和OCR学习。

Result: RICE在分割、密集检测和MLLM视觉感知任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RICE通过区域级表示提升了密集预测任务的性能，预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been

Conclusion: 该框架为安全关键应用（如自动驾驶和医疗诊断）提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块和自监督重建辅助编码器，解决了医学图像分割中的高频信息丢失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界、高频细节丢失和长程结构建模困难等挑战，现有方法如Vision Mamba虽能建模全局依赖，但导致局部高频信息丢失和空间结构退化。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）和自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE），分别通过多频带谱重建和像素级重建解决高频信息丢失和空间结构退化。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，FaRMamba优于现有CNN-Transformer混合模型和Mamba变体，边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性表现更优。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医学图像分割提供了一种灵活的频率感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述生成方面取得了显著进展，但生成的描述往往缺乏细节，过于简短和通用。研究发现，这是由于交叉熵训练中引入的对EOS标记的偏见导致的。

Method: 提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，鼓励生成更长的描述，无需复杂的奖励函数或监督数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增加了描述长度和相关细节，尽管幻觉率也有所增加。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于任何预训练模型，能够显著提升图像描述的细节丰富度。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Conclusion: 该研究为处理HSI及其他高维视觉数据中的复杂噪声耦合问题提供了新思路和通用框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于重建的框架，用于检测肘部超声图像中的内上髁撕脱，仅使用正常病例进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内上髁撕脱常见于棒球运动员，表现为骨骼轮廓的间断，学习正常骨骼的结构和连续性对检测异常至关重要。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器框架，学习正常骨骼结构的连续性，通过重建误差检测异常。

Result: 在包含16名棒球运动员的数据集上，像素级AUC为0.965，图像级AUC为0.967，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效检测内上髁撕脱，数据集已公开。

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言模型在处理稀疏大规模点云时存在特征提取慢和表示精度有限的问题。

Method: 采用动态分辨率多尺度体素化（DR-MSV）和基于注意力的轻量级元嵌入机制（TAP-LME）。

Result: DR-MSV显著提升了点云特征提取的效率和精度，TAP-LME在捕捉NeRF权重的细粒度语义上优于传统最大池化。

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM通过创新方法有效提升了3D场景感知的语言驱动认知能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉和功能上更接近现实，为人群模拟提供新见解。

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

Motivation: 解决在线视频分割中时序一致性不足的问题，如噪声积累、遮挡和场景转换。

Method: 结合DETR框架，提出局部和全局查询，并通过L2G-aligner实现早期对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如Youtube-VIS-19/-21和OVIS，AP值显著提升。

Conclusion: Local2Global框架简单高效，显著提升了在线视频分割的性能和一致性。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC为智能农业提供了有效工具，并为学术界和工业界带来新思路。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,
robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated

Result: 在DVTOD、DroneVehicle和M3FD数据集上表现最优，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: WMNet通过多频和模态自适应融合，显著提升跨模态目标检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

Method: 提出GT-mean loss，从概率角度直接建模图像均值，扩展现有损失函数，计算成本低。

Result: 实验表明，GT-mean loss能一致提升多种方法和数据集的性能。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss简单有效，解决了亮度不匹配问题，为低光图像增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量视觉语言训练语料提供了轻量且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet

To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel

Result: 在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC通过视觉和多模态信息整合，有效提升了身份感知视频描述的性能。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

Motivation: 由于骨骼比例或结构的差异，运动数据难以跨骨架传输，TPCs作为一种无结构的运动表示方法提供了兼容性，但缺乏直接用于运动任务学习的能力。

Method: 提出PUMPS架构，通过独立降维帧点云为可采样特征向量，解码器利用潜在高斯噪声向量提取时间点，并引入线性分配优化重建过程。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值等任务中表现优异，无需原生数据集监督即可达到先进水平。

Conclusion: PUMPS在通用架构下优于许多专门方法，展示了其在运动合成任务中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用（如自动驾驶和人形机器人操作）需要精确的空间感知，但VLMs的空间关系识别和运动感知能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了一个合成数据集，将空间理解分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解两类，并设计了相应的测试任务。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs的空间理解能力仍有很大提升空间，合成数据集为低成本测试提供了可能。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

*Li Jinfu,Song Hong,Xia Jianghan,Lin Yucong,Wang Ting,Shao Long,Fan Jingfan,Yang Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCTEFuse是一种动态多级图像融合网络，通过光照门控的混合手性变换器专家（MoCTE）自适应平衡纹理细节和物体对比度，显著提升红外与可见光图像融合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光照变化影响红外与可见光图像融合质量，现有方法常忽略此因素导致模态偏差，需自适应融合方法。

Method: 提出MoCTEFuse网络，结合光照门控的MoCTE和手性变换器融合块（CTFB），动态切换主辅模态并分配权重，多阶段堆叠逐步聚合信息。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，检测mAP达70.93%（MFNet）和45.14%（DroneVehicle）。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse通过动态光照适应和多级融合，显著提升融合性能，适用于复杂光照场景。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

*Saurabh Yadav,Avi Gupta,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMwave提出了一种基于小波变换的新方法，用于改进SAM模型在复杂任务中的性能，显著优于现有适配方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型（如SAM）在复杂任务中性能下降，现有适配方法效果有限。

Method: 利用小波变换提取多尺度高频特征，并引入复值适配器捕获复值空间频率信息。

Result: 在四项低层视觉任务中，SAMwave显著优于现有方法，且适用于不同SAM变体。

Conclusion: SAMwave高效、灵活且可解释，为改进基础模型在复杂任务中的性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model
that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual
prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model
combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale
visual feature fusion. The core of the proposed framework is a novel
language-vision decoder that adaptively propagates fine-grained semantic
information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention.
Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark
multi-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision
methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset.
We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理长上下文时面临计算复杂度高的挑战，令牌压缩成为关键解决方案。本文旨在系统梳理该领域进展。

Result: 提供了全面的分类和机制分析，并维护公开资源库以跟踪最新进展。

Conclusion: 本文为多模态令牌压缩领域提供了系统综述，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Result: 模型整体准确率为83.63%，优于其他对比模型，并在所有评估指标中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该模型通过全局和局部特征的协同表示，有效提升了矿区场景分类的准确性，为相关应用提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过预定义标签或隐式伪标签控制手势，但牺牲了原始运动示例的丰富细节。

Method: 通过微调LLM同时解析语音音频和运动示例，将运动示例作为显式查询上下文指导手势生成。

Result: 在FGD、运动多样性和示例-手势相似性三个指标上达到最优，支持多种输入模态和细粒度控制。

Conclusion: MECo框架在保留示例细节的同时实现语音一致性，为手势生成提供了灵活且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

TL;DR: MambaMap是一个高效融合长时域特征的框架，用于在线构建高精地图，通过内存库和门控机制提升鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用时域信息或计算开销大，MambaMap旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入内存库存储历史帧信息，动态更新BEV特征和实例查询；采用门控机制选择性融合特征；设计多方向和时空扫描策略。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaMap在提升预测精度和时域一致性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（GS）在高质量场景重建中表现优异，但其训练过程收敛缓慢，主要由于高斯基元的空间分布不优和密度化效率低下。

Method: 通过分析密度化阶段的拆分和克隆操作，提出全局到局部的密度化策略，并结合能量引导的粗到细多分辨率训练框架，动态修剪不必要的高斯基元。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化高斯基元的分布和训练框架，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的训练效率和重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: AnimalClue为野生动物监测提供了新工具，推动了间接证据识别领域的研究。

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

Result: 在五个公共MI数据集上，MIRepNet表现优于现有专用和通用EEG模型。

Conclusion: MIRepNet为MI范式提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案，适用于小样本下游任务。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的人工智能变得至关重要。然而，深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的虚假相关性，影响可靠性。

Method: 通过量化目标与偏差特征之间的线性相关性（协方差矩阵），利用白化模块消除这种相关性。无需正则化项或对抗学习。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整加权系数，有效平衡了算法的效用与公平性，且无需复杂的高阶依赖建模。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND框架有效提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性，尤其在紧急新闻场景下。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

### [89] [SWIFT: A General Sensitive Weight Identification Framework for Fast Sensor-Transfer Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20311)
*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT框架通过无监督采样和敏感权重更新，快速适应跨传感器数据，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上性能下降的问题，避免昂贵的全量重训练。

Method: 使用无监督采样选择3%的目标域样本，通过梯度分析识别并更新敏感权重。

Result: SWIFT将适应时间缩短至约一分钟，性能优于直接迁移基准，甚至媲美全量重训练。

Conclusion: SWIFT为跨传感器图像融合提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，性能达到新高度。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型的混合方法，用于在动态视频中插入3D对象，以实现时间一致性和真实光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态场景中插入3D对象时的时间一致性和光照真实性问题，填补传统3D渲染和2D扩散模型各自的不足。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）进行初始渲染以确保时间一致性，再通过2D扩散模型优化光照效果，并采用多帧加权调整优化3DGS模型。

Result: 实现了在动态视频中插入3D对象的高时间一致性和真实光照效果，特别是在手镯插入动态手腕场景中的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法首次结合了3D渲染和2D扩散模型的优势，为视频编辑提供了一种高效且逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Motivation: 增强现实引导的腹腔镜肝脏手术需要将术前信息（如肿瘤位置和血管结构）融合到有限的术中视野中，但肝脏变形预测因多种因素（如气腹、呼吸和工具交互）而极具挑战性。

Method: PIVOTS采用几何特征提取编码器和变形感知交叉注意力模块的解码器，直接从点云输入预测变形，并通过合成数据训练和验证。

Result: PIVOTS在合成和真实数据集上表现优于基线方法，对噪声、大变形和视野受限具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PIVOTS为肝脏配准提供了一种高效解决方案，并公开了代码和数据集以促进公平比较。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

Motivation: AR中的虚拟内容可能导致语义误解或用户错误，因此需要研究VIM攻击及其检测方法。

Method: 提出VIM攻击的分类法，构建数据集AR-VIM，开发结合视觉语言模型和OCR的多模态框架VIM-Sense。

Result: VIM-Sense在AR-VIM数据集上的攻击检测准确率为88.94%，优于仅视觉或文本的基线方法，检测延迟约为7秒。

Conclusion: VIM-Sense能有效检测AR中的VIM攻击，为AR安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Diff-FBP的两阶段框架，利用生成模型提升面部美观预测任务的特征提取能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部美观预测（FBP）因其主观性和细微特征而具有挑战性，现有方法难以学习与美学评估真正对齐的特征表示。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）通过自监督去噪任务预训练Diffusion Transformer；2）冻结预训练编码器，仅微调轻量回归头。

Result: 在FBP5500基准测试中，Diff-FBP达到Pearson相关系数0.932，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式预训练策略是关键，能提取更具语义特征，适用于主观视觉任务。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卡通动画生成面临非人类角色复杂性、多样化动作和细腻情感的挑战，且缺乏公开的多模态数据。

Method: 构建了包含40万视频片段的多层次标注数据集MagicAnime，并设计了多任务基准测试MagicAnime-Bench。

Result: 在四个任务上的实验验证了数据集支持高保真、细粒度和可控生成的有效性。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集填补了卡通动画多模态数据的空白，为相关研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

TL;DR: ModalFormer是一个多模态低光图像增强框架，利用九种辅助模态和跨模态Transformer实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强存在噪声、细节丢失和对比度差的问题，现有方法仅依赖RGB图像的像素级变换，忽略了多模态上下文信息。

Method: 提出ModalFormer框架，包含跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络，采用跨模态多头自注意力机制（CM-MSA）融合RGB与多模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过多模态信息融合显著提升了低光图像增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Conclusion: 论文验证了语义分割在自动驾驶中的重要性，并展示了模型在印度驾驶数据集上的性能表现。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

Method: 使用轻量级MSE指标识别低频率token，并通过锚点token保持区域保真度。

Result: 在Infinity-2B上实现2倍加速且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: SparseVAR有效平衡了计算效率和图像质量。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决多实例学习（MIL）在临床病理诊断中优先级问题的新方法，通过垂直和水平层次结构优化预测，减少误诊并优先处理重要症状。


<details>

Motivation: 现有MIL方法未充分解决病理症状和诊断类别的优先级问题，导致模型忽略类别间优先级，影响临床决策。

Method: 提出一种基于垂直和水平层次结构的新方法，通过层次对齐和隐式特征重用，优化MIL预测并优先处理严重症状。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效减少误诊，并在多类场景中优先处理重要症状。

Conclusion: 新方法通过层次结构优化MIL预测，显著提升临床诊断的准确性和优先级处理能力。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Result: 在11个数据集上表现优异，验证了主导属性对分类性能的提升。

Conclusion: BCT-CLIP通过主导属性学习，显著提升了少样本分类的判别性和性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成新视图时具有高保真度，并能产生更自然、多面的光照和阴影效果。

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频-文本数据集中的文本描述仅能反映视频内容的一部分，导致直接对齐文本与视频表示时产生错误监督。

Method: 提出T2VParser，通过自适应分解令牌（共享可学习令牌）提取多视角语义表示，实现自适应语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，T2VParser通过有效的跨模态内容分解实现了精确的部分对齐。

Conclusion: T2VParser在保留预训练模型知识的同时，实现了文本与视频的精确对齐。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic

computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of

Method: T2I-Copilot包含三个代理：输入解析器、生成引擎和质量评估器，支持全自动运行和人工干预。

Result: 在GenAI-Bench上，T2I-Copilot性能接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%，且生成质量更高。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot通过多代理协作解决了提示词优化的难题，显著提升了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

Result: GACL诱导的指标与人类质量感知一致，并成功应用于三个草图应用和自然图像质量评估。

Conclusion: GACL是一种通用方法，适用于草图质量评估和图像质量评估，并可作为数据重加权策略。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly

Method: 结合心理学研究（上下脸动作单元协调）和统计AU模式，开发DPK-GAT网络进行分层学习，并采用联邦学习框架。

Result: 在常用ME数据库上验证了方法的有效性，提升了识别性能并保护隐私。

Conclusion: FED-PsyAU框架解决了微表情识别的建模和隐私问题，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: MemoryTalker实现了仅依赖音频的高质量个性化3D面部动画，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统方法通过逐帧对齐最小化重建损失，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致动画抖动和不自然。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重建损失。

Conclusion: 显式建模语音上下文依赖的音素对合成自然的语音驱动3D面部动画至关重要。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

Conclusion: LSFDNet通过多模态融合和任务交互，有效解决了复杂场景下的船舶检测问题，填补了该领域的数据集空白。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

TL;DR: M-Net提出了一种用于MRI肿瘤分割的灵活框架，通过Mesh-Cast机制和两阶段训练策略，有效利用相邻MRI切片的空间相关性，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI肿瘤分割中，相邻切片的空间相关性未被充分利用，而3D数据的计算复杂度高，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出M-Net框架，引入Mesh-Cast机制整合序列模型，设计两阶段训练策略（TPS），先学习序列共性再优化切片特征。

Result: 在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上，M-Net在所有关键指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net通过时空建模技术，成为MRI肿瘤分割的强健解决方案。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Result: HYPIR在数值稳定性、避免模式崩溃和加速收敛方面表现优异，且支持文本引导修复和纹理调整。

Conclusion: HYPIR在高效高质量图像修复中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常检测面临多尺度时间依赖、视觉-语义异构性和标记数据稀缺等挑战，需要一种高效的方法来建模和识别异常事件。

Method: DAMS框架包含主处理路径（AMTPN与CBAM结合）和并行路径（CLIP驱动），通过多级特征解耦与融合、跨模态语义对齐和多尺度实例选择机制实现异常检测。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence基准测试中，DAMS框架表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAMS框架通过双路径互补和信息融合，构建了全面的异常事件表示与识别能力，为视频异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因视觉token数量庞大导致计算成本高，现有基于注意力的方法存在局限性（如位置偏差），需探索新的token重要性评估视角。

Method: 提出TransPrune方法，结合TTV（衡量token表征变化）和IGA（衡量指令对图像token的注意力）逐步剪枝token。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，TransPrune与原始LVLM性能相当，同时减少超半数的推理TFLOPs；TTV单独使用效果媲美基于注意力的方法。

Conclusion: TransPrune为token剪枝提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案，TTV可作为独立标准替代注意力机制。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at
https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.

Conclusion: 该方法有效恢复颜色映射，并适用于多种可视化场景。

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且鲁棒，无需预训练扩散模型，为跨域图像合成的未来研究和应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

Motivation: 生理数据情感识别在心理健康评估中至关重要，但面临多模态信号不完整和身体运动干扰的挑战。

Method: MMQ-Net结合了模态查询（重建缺失数据）、类别查询（聚焦情感特征）和干扰查询（分离噪声）的多查询机制。

Result: 实验表明，MMQ-Net在数据不完整情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMQ-Net有效解决了生理数据情感识别中的关键问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health
assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal
signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents
a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from
incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and
interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of
MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data
incompleteness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视觉分割方法主要关注交互效率，而忽视了模态表示差异和不平衡问题，导致在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: 1. 引入多粒度隐式文本（MIT）作为桥梁，建立模态共享空间；2. 提出语义反事实（SC）学习正交表示；3. 设计协作分布感知对比学习（CDCL）对齐表示。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的ICF框架通过MIT和SC有效解决了模态差异问题，CDCL进一步提升了表示对齐效果，为音频-视觉分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现有低秩适应方法在训练中投影矩阵不受限制，导致表示冗余和特征适应效果下降，现有解决方案缺乏灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: ReSoRA将低秩子矩阵分解为多个等价子空间，并系统地对不同投影的特征分布应用去冗余约束。

Result: 实验表明，ReSoRA在多种骨干网络和数据集上提升了现有PETL方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReSoRA作为一种训练监督方法，可无缝集成到现有方法中，无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该方法为远程、非接触式检测多个密封容器液位提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Motivation: 现有方法在体育场景中表现不佳，主要受运动模糊、遮挡和领域偏移的限制，且难以捕捉瞬时动作。

Method: 提出KASportsFormer框架，包含BoneExt和LimbFus模块，提取并融合骨骼运动信息，以多模态方式编码。

Result: 在SportsPose和WorldPose数据集上，MPJPE误差分别为58.0mm和34.3mm，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: KASportsFormer通过结合运动学解剖特征，显著提升了体育场景中的3D姿态估计效果。

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Conclusion: ATR-UMMIM将为无人机多模态配准和感知研究提供基础性支持。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available
at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.

Result: 实验表明，RingMo-Agent在视觉理解和复杂分析任务中表现优异，且具有跨平台和模态的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent为多源遥感图像处理提供了统一框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Result: FGump在分类和回归任务中均表现优异，回归方法避免了量化误差，实现了更高精度和更低计算时间。

Conclusion: FGump在精度和效率上优于现有AI和传统方法，为森林高度估计提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的进步，恶意行为者可以轻松伪造图像，这对KYC应用构成威胁，因此需要开发更强大的检测系统。

Method: 通过创建FantasyID数据集，模拟真实身份证设计风格和语言多样性，并模拟数字伪造攻击，以测试现有检测算法。

Result: 现有先进检测算法（如TruFor、MMFusion等）在FantasyID数据集上表现不佳，误检率接近50%。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集复杂度高，可作为检测算法的评估基准。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing

significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention

remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and

Conclusion: 论文揭示了CLIP小样本分类评估问题，提出去学习解决方案和新基准，并改进了方法。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Result: 在11个基准测试中验证了有效性，相比EAGLE减少了76%的视觉标记，性能仅下降0.3%。

Conclusion: METEOR首次实现了高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，为多模态理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code

*Ruoyu Fan,Yuhui Wen,Jiajia Dai,Tao Zhang,Long Zeng,Yong-jin Liu*

TL;DR: $S^3$LAM是一种新型RGB-D SLAM系统，利用2D surfel splatting实现高精度几何表示，优于现有3DGS方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3DGS SLAM方法依赖3D高斯椭球体的低效问题，通过2D高斯surfel提升场景表示效率。

Method: 采用2D高斯surfel作为基本单元，结合自适应表面渲染策略和相机姿态Jacobian推导。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了$S^3$LAM的先进性能。

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM通过高效几何表示和优化策略，实现了高精度SLAM。

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对象中心表示的视频合成框架，扩展了之前的SlotAdapt方法，通过结合扩散模型实现高质量、时序一致的视频生成和编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对象中心方法缺乏生成能力或忽略对象级结构，本文旨在解决这些问题，实现更可控的视频生成和编辑。

Method: 学习姿态不变的对象中心槽，并将其与预训练扩散模型结合，实现时序一致的视频合成和编辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频生成质量和时序一致性上优于现有方法，同时支持对象插入、删除等编辑操作。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了交互式视频生成和编辑的能力，为高级内容创作和动态场景理解提供了新可能。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病诊断现有方法无法同时满足高准确性、跨数据集泛化性、缺失模态鲁棒性和可解释性，限制了其临床可靠性。

Method: OmniBrain整合多模态数据（MRI、影像组学、基因表达、临床数据），采用交叉注意力和模态丢弃技术构建统一模型。

Result: 在ANMerge数据集上准确率达92.2±2.4%，在MRI-only的ADNI数据集上为70.4±2.7%，优于单模态和现有多模态方法。

Conclusion: OmniBrain为阿尔茨海默病诊断提供了鲁棒、可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督物体发现（UOD）缺乏标注数据，现有方法依赖启发式前景先验和固定迭代次数，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出基于min-cut和集成方法的UnionCut前景先验，以及高效准确的蒸馏模型UnionSeg。

Result: 实验表明，结合UnionCut或UnionSeg后，现有UOD方法在单物体发现、显著性检测和自监督实例分割任务中性能提升。

Conclusion: UnionCut和UnionSeg为UOD提供了鲁棒的前景先验，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Conclusion: 为自动化康复评估研究奠定基础，促进可靠、可访问和个性化康复解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1为更安全、智能的自动驾驶系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

Motivation: 非手动面部特征在手语交流中至关重要，但在自动手语识别中的研究不足，现有方法多依赖手工特征提取且未深入分析不同面部区域的贡献。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CNN和Transformer）在孤立手语数据集上系统评估眼睛、嘴部和全脸等不同面部区域的贡献。

Result: 通过定量和定性分析，发现嘴部是最重要的非手动面部特征，显著提升了识别准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在自动手语识别中纳入面部特征的必要性。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其是对细粒度视觉元素的处理不准确。

Method: 提出$A^2R^2$框架，结合注意力定位和迭代优化，使VLMs能够自我修正并逐步提升预测质量。

Result: 实验表明$A^2R^2$在六项评估指标上显著优于基线方法，且推理轮次增加能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$框架在Img2LaTeX任务中表现出色，其核心组件的协同作用得到验证。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视觉系统在冬季恶劣天气下的可靠性，为全天候应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Motivation: 计算病理学中，模型在不同扫描仪下的性能差异是一个关键挑战，影响实际应用中的诊断和治疗规划。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集（480个组织样本，每个用5种扫描仪扫描）和SimCons框架（结合增强技术和一致性损失）。

Result: SimCons提高了模型在不同扫描仪下的一致性，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: SCORPION和SimCons为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的重要资源。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD作为一种外部插件，保留了CLIP的原始能力，显著提升了伪造检测的准确性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Motivation: 低空无人机场景中的参考图像分割（RIS）尚未充分研究，现有方法难以处理其独特特性（如多样视角和高密度对象）。

Method: 提出了RIS-LAD数据集和SAARN模型，后者通过类别主导的语言增强（CDLE）和自适应推理融合模块（ARFM）动态处理语义信息。

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法构成挑战，SAARN能有效应对这些挑战。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD填补了低空无人机场景的空白，SAARN为复杂场景提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QBE需要样本查询文档，而ABDIR提供了基于视觉属性的灵活检索方式。论文旨在通过生成式AI结合两者的优势。

Method: 利用文本到图像生成（T2I）技术（如Leonardo.Ai）生成查询图像，结合ABDIR属性描述，再通过QBE范式进行检索。

Result: 在HisIR19历史文档数据集上的实验验证了T2I-QBE的可行性。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是首次尝试将T2I生成技术应用于文档图像检索，为历史文档检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

TL;DR: ARC-Hunyuan-Video是一个多模态模型，用于端到端处理视频输入中的视觉、音频和文本信号，支持多种视频理解任务，并在实际应用中显著提升用户参与度和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型缺乏对现实世界短视频的深入理解能力，而这些能力是视频搜索、推荐和新兴应用的基础。短视频的复杂性（如高信息密度和快速节奏）需要高级推理能力。

Method: 模型通过预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习后训练和最终指令微调的综合训练方案，利用高质量自动标注数据进行训练。

Result: 在ShortVid-Bench基准测试中表现出色，支持零样本或少样本微调，实际部署显著提升用户参与度和满意度，推理效率高（10秒处理1分钟视频）。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video在现实世界短视频理解任务中表现优异，具有高效性和广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需掩码的语音驱动说话人脸生成方法，解决了现有掩码策略导致的信息丢失和身份细节退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码的方法会导致输入信息丢失、身份参考图像与输入图像不一致，以及身份参考对模型的负面影响。

Method: 采用两步地标点方法将输入图像转换为闭口状态，再通过唇部适配模型生成与音频同步的唇部动作，无需掩码或身份参考图像。

Result: 在LRS2和HDTF数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并通过消融实验证明了其贡献。

Conclusion: 提出的方法避免了掩码策略的缺陷，提升了说话人脸生成的视觉质量和身份细节保留能力。

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GTAD的全局时间聚合去噪网络，用于高效利用历史观测中的全局时间信息，提升动态环境感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用全局时间序列信息，主要依赖相邻帧的局部时间交互，限制了动态环境感知的准确性。

Method: 提出GTAD网络，结合局部时间特征和全局时间特征，通过去噪网络实现全局时间信息的有效聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中表现优越，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GTAD方法能够更全面、连贯地理解动态环境，为3D场景理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航拍图像中车辆检测模型因地理区域差异导致的泛化性能下降问题。

Method: 采用多阶段、多模态知识转移框架，结合微调的潜在扩散模型（LDMs）来缩小源域和目标域之间的分布差距。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个航拍图像域中性能显著提升，AP50指标优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了域适应问题，并贡献了两个新的航拍数据集，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的深度网络架构LargeMvC-Net，通过分解锚点聚类过程为三个模块，提升了大规模多视图聚类的效果和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于锚点的多视图聚类方法在锚点结构设计上缺乏优化原则，忽略了核心结构需求，导致效果受限。

Method: 将锚点聚类问题分解为三个模块（RepresentModule、NoiseModule、AnchorModule），并通过展开优化步骤设计网络架构。

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过结构清晰和优化可追溯的设计，显著提升了锚点多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“安全张量”的方法，通过可训练的输入向量将文本安全对齐扩展到视觉模态，以解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在多模态输入中的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本安全机制无法直接应用于视觉模态，导致LVLM容易受到有害图像输入的影响。

Method: 通过安全张量（文本或视觉模态的可训练输入向量）在推理过程中应用，无需修改模型参数。使用包含恶意图像-文本对、对比良性对和一般良性样本的数据集进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，安全张量显著提升了LVLM拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时保持对良性任务的性能。内部分析显示，安全张量成功激活了语言模块的文本“安全层”。

Conclusion: 安全张量有效地将文本安全机制扩展到视觉模态，填补了跨模态安全空白。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对抗训练取得了进展，但模型准确性与鲁棒性之间仍存在差距，需要一种更有效的方法来提升CNN的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 通过对抗训练生成多个教师模型，利用多教师知识蒸馏和自适应学习策略指导学生模型在干净数据上的学习。

Result: 在MNIST-Digits和Fashion-MNIST数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多教师对抗蒸馏和自适应学习策略有效提升了CNN的对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗数据即可实现。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 现有面部情感识别系统将情感简化为固定标签或维度，缺乏灵活性和表现力，而自然语言能更丰富地描述情感。

Method: 引入EmoCap100K数据集（10万样本）和EmoCapCLIP框架，结合全局-局部对比学习和跨模态引导正样本挖掘。

Result: 在20多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了从大规模语义丰富描述中学习情感表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 自然语言描述为面部情感表示学习提供了更灵活和丰富的监督信号，EmoCapCLIP展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

Result: 微调后的开源模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著缩小了与专有模型的差距。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望促进指令引导图像编辑领域的开放研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

Result: 提出了一个层次化的框架，并总结了各层次的挑战和潜在发展方向。

Conclusion: 论文填补了4D空间智能重建领域的空白，并提供了未来研究的指导方向。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in discrete
action spaces by eliminating value function dependencies through group-based
advantage estimation. However, its application to continuous control remains
unexplored, limiting its utility in robotics where continuous actions are
essential. This paper presents a theoretical framework extending GRPO to
continuous control environments, addressing challenges in high-dimensional
action spaces, sparse rewards, and temporal dynamics. Our approach introduces
trajectory-based policy clustering, state-aware advantage estimation, and
regularized policy updates designed for robotic applications. We provide
theoretical analysis of convergence properties and computational complexity,
establishing a foundation for future empirical validation in robotic systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则和模型预测的方法在自主停车中缺乏适应性和泛化能力，无法处理非线性及环境依赖的复杂性。

Method: 设计了三种结构化奖励策略（GOR、DPR、MAR），结合了同策略和异策略优化方法，并在Unity模拟环境中训练。

Result: 实验表明，同策略MAR的成功率达91%，轨迹更平滑且行为更鲁棒，而GOR和DPR效果不佳。

Conclusion: RARLAP通过奖励增强有效解决了自主停车的复杂性问题，提升了策略的适应性和训练效率。

Abstract: Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of
intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints,
frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins.
However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the
adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and
environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we
propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates
the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured
reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely
within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We
systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only
reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward
(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization
paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a
91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,
while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory
analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability,
accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall,
RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex
autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy
optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility,
the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.

learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

TL;DR: RAKOMO是一种结合K-Order Markov Optimization（KOMO）和基于可达区域（reachability margin）的运动规划技术，用于解决腿式机械臂的复杂运动规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腿式机械臂（如带机械臂的四足机器人）的运动规划需考虑复杂的运动学约束，传统方法因接触不连续性和计算限制难以有效解决。

Method: RAKOMO整合了KOMO和基于神经网络预测的可达区域优化，将其纳入KOMO框架，实现快速梯度优化。

Result: 通过仿真实验，RAKOMO在HyQReal四足机器人上成功执行了拾取任务，优于基线KOMO方法。

Conclusion: RAKOMO为腿式机械臂的运动规划提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require
motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints
in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However,
trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid
dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg
limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose
RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order
Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the
reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network
to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO
formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion
planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it
effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation
tasks. We benchmark RAKOMO against a baseline KOMO approach through a set of
simulations for pick-and-place tasks with the HyQReal quadruped robot equipped
with a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of future agent trajectories is a critical challenge for
ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation, particularly in complex
urban environments characterized by multiple plausible future scenarios. In
this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based
with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in
trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model
to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving
beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that
predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our
framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary
conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These
constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but
also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles.
Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory
predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in
autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive
ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight
their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing
data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a
robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world
urban environments.

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due
to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors
can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent
(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to
address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning
frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)
inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in
annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide
the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.
Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can
dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.
Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model
distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula
related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning
module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different
environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate
environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also
compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy
detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for utilizing skin sensors as a new
operation interface of complex robots. The skin sensors employed in this study
possess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple
contact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is
anticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions
exhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot
motion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by
altering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this
paper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing
recurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success
of this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for
software-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive
encoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy
and learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to
the classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to
mount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the
activation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of
measuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation
with other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated
by the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the
accuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm
mobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine
Interface. https://youtu.be/UjUXT4Z4BC8

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation, fundamental to human daily activities, remains a
challenging task due to its inherent complexity of coordinated control. Recent
advances have enabled zero-shot learning of single-arm manipulation skills
through agent-agnostic visual representations derived from human videos;
however, these methods overlook crucial agent-specific information necessary
for bimanual coordination, such as end-effector positions. We propose Ag2x2, a
computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware
visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion
patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from
Bi-DexHands and PerAct2, including challenging scenarios with deformable
objects like ropes. This performance outperforms baseline methods and even
surpasses the success rate of policies trained with expert-engineered rewards.
Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be
effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline
for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust
performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered
rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual
robotic skills.

Abstract: 4D imaging radar is a type of low-cost millimeter-wave radar(costing merely
10-20$\%$ of lidar systems) capable of providing range, azimuth, elevation, and
Doppler velocity information. Accurate extrinsic calibration between
millimeter-wave radar and camera systems is critical for robust multimodal
perception in robotics, yet remains challenging due to inherent sensor noise
characteristics and complex error propagation. This paper presents a systematic
calibration framework to address critical challenges through a spatial 3d
uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP) that explicitly models spherical
coordinate noise propagation in radar measurements, then compensating for
non-zero error expectations during coordinate transformations. Finally,
experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art CPnP baseline, including improved consistency in simulations
and enhanced precision in physical experiments. This study provides a robust
calibration solution for robotic systems equipped with millimeter-wave radar
and cameras, tailored specifically for autonomous driving and robotic
perception applications.

Abstract: In many applications, robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and
natural environments where they encounter various types of vegetation.
Vegetation presents unique challenges as a traversable obstacle, where the
mechanical properties of the plants can influence whether a robot can safely
collide with and overcome the obstacle. A more nuanced approach is required to
assess the safety and traversability of these obstacles, as collisions can
sometimes be safe and necessary for navigating through dense or unavoidable
vegetation. This paper introduces a novel sensor designed to directly measure
the applied forces exerted by vegetation on a robot: by directly capturing the
push-back forces, our sensor provides a detailed understanding of the
interactions between the robot and its surroundings. We demonstrate the
sensor's effectiveness through experimental validations, showcasing its ability
to measure subtle force variations. This force-based approach provides a
quantifiable metric that can inform navigation decisions and serve as a
foundation for developing future learning algorithms.

Conclusion: PlaneHEC通过创新的计算模型设计，实现了通用且快速的标定，为多智能体系统和具身智能发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems
and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera
coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view
robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual
assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient.
Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye
calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished
using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration
results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC
introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which
makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a
comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it
withiterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively
evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world
environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration
methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast
calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a
strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型（LLMs）的机器人系统多为开环规划，无法适应动态环境中的突发情况，亟需一种闭环学习框架。

Method: T-A-L框架通过“思考-行动-学习”闭环循环，利用LLM分解任务、执行计划并基于反馈自我反思，存储经验以优化未来策略。

Conclusion: T-A-L框架为开发更鲁棒、自适应和真正自主的机器人系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current
systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,
rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in
dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that
enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through
continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an
LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.
The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal
sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to
facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal
analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are
stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We
demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world
that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including
open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our
framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,
converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits
remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant
step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic
agents.

Conclusion: 结合时间感知的同伦属性可有效提升多智能体轨迹规划的协调性和成功率。

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency,
yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense
environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to
traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we
propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap
between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a
homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully
leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is
chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and
temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At
the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization
method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free
trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its
adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies
demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the
underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and
improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated
dense scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises safer roads, reduced congestion, and improved
mobility, yet validating these systems across diverse conditions remains a
major challenge. Real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes
unsafe, making large-scale validation impractical. In contrast, simulation
environments offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for rigorous
verification and validation. A critical component of the validation process is
scenario generation, which involves designing and configuring traffic scenarios
to evaluate autonomous systems' responses to various events and uncertainties.
However, existing scenario generation tools often require programming
knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. To address this
limitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario
generation. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to
create, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding
expertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as
Scenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports
a broader user base. Central to our framework is a graph-based scenario
representation that facilitates structured management, supports both manual and
automated generation, and enables integration with deep learning-based scenario
and behavior generation methods. In automated mode, the framework can randomly
sample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,
allowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets. By simplifying
the scenario generation process, this framework supports more efficient testing
workflows and increases the accessibility of simulation-based validation for
researchers, engineers, and policymakers.

Conclusion: 新型传感器显著提升了扫描速度和精度，适用于工业表面检测。

Abstract: Inspecting large-scale industrial surfaces like aircraft fuselages for
quality control requires capturing their precise 3D surface geometry at high
resolution. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) offer high local resolution
but require slow 'press-and-lift' measurements stitched for large areas.
Approaches with sliding or roller/belt VBTS designs provide measurements
continuity. However, they face significant challenges respectively: sliding
struggles with friction/wear and both approaches are speed-limited by
conventional camera frame rates and motion blur, making large-area scanning
time consuming. Thus, a rapid, continuous, high-resolution method is needed. We
introduce a novel tactile sensor integrating a neuromorphic camera in a rolling
mechanism to achieve this. Leveraging its high temporal resolution and
robustness to motion blur, our system uses a modified event-based multi-view
stereo approach for 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art scanning
speeds up to 0.5 m/s, achieving Mean Absolute Error below 100 microns -- 11
times faster than prior continuous tactile sensing methods. A multi-reference
Bayesian fusion strategy enhances accuracy (reducing MAE by 25.2\% compared to
EMVS) and mitigates curvature errors. We also validate high-speed feature
recognition via Braille reading 2.6 times faster than previous approaches.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone
from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing
excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to
tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our
daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and
different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and
application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on
which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning
models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully
applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks,
environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an
assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a
short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These
range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of
tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to
designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic
enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a
variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with
humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based
profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not
optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing
responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term
challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while
guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability
for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain
limited to specific tasks and clothes types, due to the complex,
high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation
with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes
manipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long
dresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... .
The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right
shoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient
for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably
extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate
representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints
to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high
level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the
semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a
simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments
show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks
across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four
distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's
performance on a real robot.

Abstract: Construction throughout history typically assumes that its blueprints and
building blocks are pre-determined. However, recent work suggests that
alternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation.
Aleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular
building blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far
relied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms
could be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and
forming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by
which robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a
robophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media
composed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals
to autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material.
We test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot
performance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as
a 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive
loading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material
properties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and
construction. To better understand these material properties, we develop an
apparatus for tensile testing of the geometrically cohesive substrates, which
reveals how entangled material strength responds strongly to initial
compressive loading. These results explain the variation observed in robotic
performance and point to future directions for better understanding robotic
interaction mechanics with entangled materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁触觉传感器（MBTS）设计紧凑且高频操作，但稀疏的触觉阵列限制了其空间分辨率。

Method: 通过条件变分自编码器，从低分辨率MBTS输入推断高分辨率形状，利用同步采集的高分辨率VBTS数据进行监督。

Result: MBTS采样频率达125 Hz，形状重建推理时间低于2.5 ms。

Conclusion: 跨模态协同提升了MBTS的触觉感知能力，有望应用于高精度机器人任务。

Abstract: Magnetic-based tactile sensors (MBTS) combine the advantages of compact
design and high-frequency operation but suffer from limited spatial resolution
due to their sparse taxel arrays. This paper proposes SuperMag, a tactile shape
reconstruction method that addresses this limitation by leveraging
high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor (VBTS) data to supervise MBTS
super-resolution. Co-designed, open-source VBTS and MBTS with identical contact
modules enable synchronized data collection of high-resolution shapes and
magnetic signals via a symmetric calibration setup. We frame tactile shape
reconstruction as a conditional generative problem, employing a conditional
variational auto-encoder to infer high-resolution shapes from low-resolution
MBTS inputs. The MBTS achieves a sampling frequency of 125 Hz, whereas the
shape reconstruction sustains an inference time within 2.5 ms. This
cross-modality synergy advances tactile perception of the MBTS, potentially
unlocking its new capabilities in high-precision robotic tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在目标导航任务中，几何启发式方法（DWFE）比大型语言模型（LLM）更能提升性能，而轻量级语言先验（SHF）进一步优化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）在目标导航任务中的实际作用，验证其是否真正提升了规划能力。

Method: 在HM3D-v1验证集上，移除InstructNav的复杂组件，替换为简单的几何启发式方法（DWFE），并引入轻量级语言先验（SHF）。

Result: DWFE将成功率从58.0%提升至61.1%，路径效率（SPL）从20.9%提升至36.0%；SHF进一步优化了路径。

Conclusion: 几何启发式方法（而非LLM的推理能力）是性能提升的主要驱动力，未来需结合度量感知提示或离线语义图才能体现LLM的智能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in
ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains
unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we
strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary
GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple
Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises
Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000
validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines.
Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this
yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps
on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks
and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an
almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not
emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that
metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before
attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂实时和可穿戴传感器的人体运动分析系统奠定了基础，对康复、机器人和外骨骼设计有潜在推动作用。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations enable the accurate description and
analysis of the movement of biological systems with applications such as
rehabilitation assessment, prosthesis, and exoskeleton design. However, the
widespread usage of these techniques is limited by costly sensors,
laboratory-based setups, computationally demanding processes, and the use of
diverse software tools that often lack seamless integration. In this work, we
address these limitations by proposing an integrated, real-time framework for
musculoskeletal modeling and simulations that leverages OpenSimRT, the robotics
operating system (ROS), and wearable sensors. As a proof-of-concept, we
demonstrate that this framework can reasonably well describe inverse kinematics
of both lower and upper body using either inertial measurement units or
fiducial markers. Additionally, we show that it can effectively estimate
inverse dynamics of the ankle joint and muscle activations of major lower limb
muscles during daily activities, including walking, squatting and sit to stand,
stand to sit when combined with pressure insoles. We believe this work lays the
groundwork for further studies with more complex real-time and wearable
sensor-based human movement analysis systems and holds potential to advance
technologies in rehabilitation, robotics and exoskeleton designs.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在肋间成像中表现出高精度和鲁棒性，为机器人超声系统的临床应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in clinical examinations due
to its portability, real-time capability, and radiation-free nature. To address
inter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained
increasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal
imaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation
method within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we
explore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib
structures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone
surface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related
signals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic
noise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile
point cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human
palpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,
the sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a
denser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an
image-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping
for individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of
interest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize
structures beneath the bone. To validate the proposed method, we conducted
comprehensive experiments on four distinct phantoms. The final scanning
waypoint mapping achieved Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (MNND) and Hausdorff
distance (HD) errors of 3.41 mm and 3.65 mm, respectively, while the
reconstructed object beneath the bone had errors of 0.69 mm and 2.2 mm compared
to the CT ground truth.

Conclusion: 方法实用性强，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Decentralized multi-agent navigation under uncertainty is a complex task that
arises in numerous robotic applications. It requires collision avoidance
strategies that account for both kinematic constraints, sensing and action
execution noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the
Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with a probabilistic adaptation of
Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance. Our method ensures safe and efficient
multi-agent navigation by incorporating probabilistic safety constraints
directly into the MPPI sampling process via a Second-Order Cone Programming
formulation. This approach enables agents to operate independently using local
noisy observations while maintaining safety guarantees. We validate our
algorithm through extensive simulations with differential-drive robots and
benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods, including ORCA-DD and B-UAVC.
Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms them while achieving high
success rates, even in densely populated environments. Additionally, validation
in the Gazebo simulator confirms its practical applicability to robotic
platforms.

Abstract: Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing
regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater
infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration.
However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments,
characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication
constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy
while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these
challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly
knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable
robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental
data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond
effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to
demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple
robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human
supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with
knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent
decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in
100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies
reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the
LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications,
but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting
arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism
for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions
with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind
legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this
inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is
dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the
coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive
experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over
baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates
the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle
probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging
dynamics and external disturbances.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained increasing attention in recent years, as a safe
environment to accelerate the development of motion planning and control
methods for autonomous driving. Deep learning models, predominantly based on
neural networks (NNs), have demonstrated significant potential in modeling the
vehicle dynamics and in performing various tasks in autonomous driving.
However, their black-box nature is critical in the context of autonomous
racing, where safety and robustness demand a thorough understanding of the
decision-making algorithms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
MS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering
control, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into
the neural architecture. The proposed controller is validated using real-world
data from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) competition, with
full-scale autonomous race cars. In comparison with general-purpose NNs,
MS-NN-steer is shown to achieve better accuracy and generalization with small
training datasets, while being less sensitive to the weights' initialization.
Also, MS-NN-steer outperforms the steering controller used by the A2RL winning
team. Our implementation is available open-source in a GitHub repository.

Abstract: Learning physical interaction skills, such as dancing, handshaking, or
sparring, remains a fundamental challenge for agents operating in human
environments, particularly when the agent's morphology differs significantly
from that of the demonstrator. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted
objectives or morphological similarity, limiting their capacity for
generalization. Here, we introduce a framework that enables agents with diverse
embodiments to learn wholebbody interaction behaviors directly from human
demonstrations. The framework extracts a compact, transferable representation
of interaction dynamics, called the Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG), which
captures key spatiotemporal relationships between the interacting agents. This
graph is then used as an imitation objective to train control policies in
physics-based simulations, allowing the agent to generate motions that are both
semantically meaningful and physically feasible. We demonstrate BuddyImitation
on multiple agents, such as humans, quadrupedal robots with manipulators, or
mobile manipulators and various interaction scenarios, including sparring,
handshaking, rock-paper-scissors, or dancing. Our results demonstrate a
promising path toward coordinated behaviors across morphologically distinct
characters via cross embodiment interaction learning.

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and
practicality compared to vision-language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a large-scale, high-precision LiDAR-Inertial Odometry
(LIO) dataset, aiming to address the insufficient validation of LIO systems in
complex real-world scenarios in existing research. The dataset covers four
diverse real-world environments spanning 60,000 to 750,000 square meters,
collected using a custom backpack-mounted platform equipped with multi-beam
LiDAR, an industrial-grade IMU, and RTK-GNSS modules. The dataset includes long
trajectories, complex scenes, and high-precision ground truth, generated by
fusing SLAM-based optimization with RTK-GNSS anchoring, and validated for
trajectory accuracy through the integration of oblique photogrammetry and
RTK-GNSS. This dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the
generalization ability of LIO systems in practical high-precision mapping
scenarios.

Motivation: 统一不同地图对于多会话和多机器人协作至关重要，但动态环境和传感器差异导致点云分布和场景一致性差异，影响地图对齐。

Method: Uni-Mapper包括动态物体移除、动态感知闭环检测和多模态LiDAR地图合并模块，采用体素自由空间哈希图和全局描述符。

Result: 在动态环境和异构LiDAR数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Uni-Mapper在多模态LiDAR系统和动态环境中实现了鲁棒的地图合并和闭环检测。

Abstract: The unification of disparate maps is crucial for enabling scalable robot
operation across multiple sessions and collaborative multi-robot scenarios.
However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic
environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and
dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene
consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure
detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging
framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,
dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A
voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify
and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal
module is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved
static local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic
environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are
conducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a
centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during
map merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph
optimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for
globally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse
real-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing
superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping
in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing
methods. Project Page: https://sparolab.github.io/research/uni_mapper.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法（分析算法和深度学习模型）用于桁架结构中可导航表面的分割，比较了它们的性能与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桁架结构的检查和维护成本高且危险，现有研究多关注故障检测或机器人设计，而自主导航研究较少。

Method: 采用分析算法和深度学习模型（如PointNet、PointTransformerV3）对3D点云进行可导航表面分割。

Result: 分析算法参数调节简单且性能接近深度学习模型，而深度学习模型（如PointTransformerV3）在分割精度上更优（mIoU约97%）。

Conclusion: 研究展示了分析和深度学习方法在复杂桁架环境中的潜力，为自主基础设施检查提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

Conclusion: FMimic为机器人系统提供了一种高效且直观的技能学习方式，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Visual imitation learning (VIL) provides an efficient and intuitive strategy
for robotic systems to acquire novel skills. Recent advancements in foundation
models, particularly Vision Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in visual and linguistic reasoning for VIL tasks.
Despite this progress, existing approaches primarily utilize these models for
learning high-level plans from human demonstrations, relying on pre-defined
motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major
bottleneck for robotic systems. In this work, we present FMimic, a novel
paradigm that harnesses foundation models to directly learn generalizable
skills at even fine-grained action levels, using only a limited number of human
videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FMimic delivers strong
performance with a single human video, and significantly outperforms all other
methods with five videos. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant
improvements of over 39% and 29% in RLBench multi-task experiments and
real-world manipulation tasks, respectively, and exceeds baselines by more than
34% in high-precision tasks and 47% in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to
agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods,
such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive,
environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This
research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system
designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central,
tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF
identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest
neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field
deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated
LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p
< 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in
tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to
conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and
improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced
autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential
for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative
potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species
management and improved environmental outcomes.

Abstract: Situationally-aware artificial agents operating with competence in natural
environments face several challenges: spatial awareness, object affordance
detection, dynamic changes and unpredictability. A critical challenge is the
agent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its
objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for
reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object
recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as
optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system
is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic
knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to
create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer
entities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of
reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for
normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved
in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to
autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to
recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible
by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach
in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects
involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle
initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it
learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able
to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores
the agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a
systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning
[...].

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown
impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road
users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in
interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex
multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on
crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to
AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic
boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed
behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling
interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a
cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is
integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic
interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk
Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused
measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like
trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a
dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a
Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and
informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework
effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation
compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Result: 在液体倾倒任务中，该方法即使基于少量数据训练的模型也表现出更高的成功率，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在机器人决策中实现鲁棒性的潜力。

Abstract: Physics-based simulations and learning-based models are vital for complex
robotics tasks like deformable object manipulation and liquid handling.
However, these models often struggle with accuracy due to epistemic uncertainty
or the sim-to-real gap. For instance, accurately pouring liquid from one
container to another poses challenges, particularly when models are trained on
limited demonstrations and may perform poorly in novel situations. This paper
proposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm designed
to mitigate these inaccuracies. By incorporating estimates of model
uncertainty, the proposed MCTS strategy biases the search towards actions with
lower predicted uncertainty. This approach enhances the reliability of planning
under uncertain conditions. Applied to a liquid pouring task, our method
demonstrates improved success rates even with models trained on minimal data,
outperforming traditional methods and showcasing its potential for robust
decision-making in robotics.

Abstract: To facilitate the wider adoption of robotics, accessible programming tools
are required for non-experts. Observational learning enables intuitive human
skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual
input can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation,
especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a
human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically
generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large
Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task
aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the
vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the
received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and
effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without
requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and
hallucination corrections promoted system robustness.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel hybrid approach for vision-only navigation of

classical model-based planning algorithms. Today, purely data-driven end-to-end
models are dominant solutions to this problem. Despite advantages such as
flexibility and adaptability, the requirement of a large amount of training

applications. To address these limitations, we propose a hierarchical system
that utilizes recent advances in model predictive control, traversability
estimation, visual place recognition, and pose estimation, employing
topological graphs as a representation of the target environment. Using such a
combination, we provide a scalable system with a higher level of

Conclusion: 该方法为交通规划者提供了有效的数据增强工具，支持更精准和包容的城市交通规划。

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network

Method: 在小波域中应用可学习的非线性变换（如软阈值和增益相位调制），并支持自适应小波基选择（如Haar、Daubechies等）。

Result: 在3D去噪和GLUE基准测试（如SST-2情感分类）中，模型准确率为89.3%，参数和内存使用分别减少72%和58%。

Conclusion: 谱学习方法为视觉和语言任务提供了高效、紧凑且可解释的模型设计方向。

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to

December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构健康监测（SHM）的训练数据昂贵且难以获取，尤其是标记数据。不同结构间的分布差异限制了传统机器学习方法的泛化能力。

Method: 采用迁移学习（TL）跨域利用信息，利用物理知识选择特征，并使用MAC量化模态对应关系。

Result: MAC与监督度量高度一致，能有效选择跨域条件分布不变的特征。

Conclusion: MAC可作为选择跨域一致性特征的度量，在数值和实验案例中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

Conclusion: PINN是一种强大的工具，能够结合先验知识高效解决微分方程问题，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

Abstract: Deep learning neural networks architectures such Multi Layer Perceptrons
(MLP) and Convolutional blocks still play a crucial role in nowadays research
advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be
represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes
while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent
work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that
reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural
network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies
are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features
such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last,
but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix
convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions
of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their
Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters.
Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic
AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and
anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset
\textit{AbnormalHeartbeat} that contains audio signals obtained from the

capabilities and limitations. Extensive evaluations reveal significant
performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and

Conclusion: STAG为图学习与LLM结合提供了优雅解决方案，无需源域标记数据，性能卓越。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积自编码器的深度学习框架，用于从心房颤动（AF）的心内电图中提取无监督特征，以检测AF驱动源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前消融疗法对持续性AF效果不佳，因非肺静脉驱动源的存在。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器从单极和双极心内电图中提取特征，并训练下游分类器检测AF驱动源。

Result: 模型在检测旋转和局灶活动时表现中等（AUC 0.73-0.76），在识别心房电图纠缠时表现优异（AUC 0.93）。

Conclusion: 该方法可实时运行，并有望整合到临床电解剖标测系统中，辅助消融手术。

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

Motivation: 机器学习虽然流行且易用，但计算密集且功耗高，因此需要探索物理系统实现学习任务的替代方案。

Method: 引入BEASTAL训练方案，仅控制边界参数，利用局部物理规则进行学习，模拟回归和分类任务。

Result: BEASTAL能够完成任何线性任务，在局部演化规则非线性时表现最佳。

Conclusion: BEASTAL通过直观的局部演化规则，无需大规模内存或复杂内部架构，推动了物理学习方案的发展。

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal
architectures. BEASTAL can perform any linear task, achieving best performance
when the local evolution rule is non-linear.

Motivation: 解决传统方法中需要访问本地数据和重复解决质量运输问题的高复杂度问题。

Conclusion: 该算法在混合模型示例中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose an efficient federated dual decomposition algorithm for
calculating the Wasserstein barycenter of several distributions, including
choosing the support of the solution. The algorithm does not access local data
and uses only highly aggregated information. It also does not require repeated
solutions to mass transportation problems. Because of the absence of any
matrix-vector operations, the algorithm exhibits a very low complexity of each
iteration and significant scalability. We illustrate its virtues and compare it
to the state-of-the-art methods on several examples of mixture models.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

Motivation: 股票市场高度波动，传统交易决策难以稳定盈利，需开发更有效的交易策略。

Method: 设计四种损失函数，结合买入和做空策略，训练时间序列模型（如Crossformer）进行交易决策。

Result: 在2021-2023年测试中，最佳损失函数模型收益达51.42%、51.04%和48.62%，显著优于PPO、DDPG等强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 新损失函数结合时间序列模型能有效提升股票交易策略的盈利能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

TL;DR: 神经网络在特征学习能力上优于核方法，但现有理论主要关注特征学习的强度而非质量，无法充分解释泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络为何在特征学习上优于核方法，并探讨现有理论的局限性。

Method: 引入“特征质量”概念，并通过实证分析评估现有理论。

Result: 现有理论主要衡量特征学习的强度，而非特征质量，无法为泛化理论提供充分基础。

Conclusion: 需要发展更全面的理论来评估特征质量，以解释神经网络的泛化性能。

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

Motivation: CAN协议缺乏安全机制，易受网络攻击，需要高效且轻量的入侵检测方法。

Method: 将CAN流量表示为图，使用多层GAT作为教师模型，训练小型学生GAT，结合监督预训练和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在Car-Hacking和Car-Survival数据集上，学生模型准确率分别达99.97%和99.31%，但在类不平衡的can-train-and-test数据集上表现下降。

Conclusion: KD-GAT框架有效，但需解决类不平衡问题以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

Motivation: 理解人们在访问一个商业场所后的去向对城市规划、零售分析和基于位置的服务至关重要，但传统方法因数据稀疏性和空间与商业关系的复杂性而受限。

Method: 采用NAICS-aware GraphSAGE，结合商业分类知识（通过可学习嵌入）和空间、时间、社会经济特征，以端到端框架处理大规模数据。

Result: 在包含9490万共访记录的POI-Graph数据集上，R-squared值从0.243提升至0.625（提升157%），排名质量也有显著提升（NDCG@10提升32%）。

Conclusion: 商业语义（通过行业代码捕获）是预测共访模式的关键信号，该方法在性能和可扩展性上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

Conclusion: 分离生成模型框架在隐私保护和数据效用间取得了良好平衡，适用于多种模型类型。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

Motivation: 传统近似最近邻（ANN）检索方法在语义多样性和上下文丰富性上表现不足，无法满足如RAG、多跳QA等应用的需求。

Method: 提出基于图的向量检索方法，通过在向量空间上叠加语义图（如kNN或知识图谱链接）实现多跳、上下文感知的搜索。

Result: 理论分析表明，图结构能改善高维集中性下的语义覆盖，为基于意义的向量搜索系统奠定基础。

Conclusion: 研究为向量搜索系统提供了混合索引、多样性感知查询和结构化语义检索的新方向，并公开了实现以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While
effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented
agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM有效解决了灾害场景下人类移动性预测的挑战，为灾害预警和救援资源分配提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next
intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the
intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.
Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\%
improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score
of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a
symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the
PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming
XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the
exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour
count, surgeon experience, and hospital stay - offering accuracy and full
transparency. This makes TM a powerful, trustworthy decision-support tool ready
for real-world adoption.

Motivation: 探讨FL在医学影像中的实际部署问题，特别是本地配置对性能的影响。

Result: 本地优化器和学习率的选择对性能影响更大，本地训练轮数的影响因FL方法而异。

Conclusion: 适当的本地配置比算法复杂性对FL效果更关键。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GNSP的持续学习方法，通过将任务特定梯度投影到先前知识的零空间，避免灾难性遗忘，并结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失，保持了CLIP的零样本能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在持续学习多任务时会出现灾难性遗忘和嵌入对齐退化的问题，影响其零样本能力。

Method: 提出梯度零空间投影（GNSP）方法，结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失，保护多模态嵌入空间结构。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中取得SOTA性能，保持了CLIP的模态间隙和跨模态检索性能。

Conclusion: GNSP方法有效解决了CLIP在持续学习中的问题，同时保持了其零样本能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Method: 采用数据驱动的无模型强化学习方法（MADDPG），并利用VAE-GAN模型研究价格操纵策略。

Result: 在对抗性定价下，缺乏发电能力的产消者群体遭受财务损失；随着市场规模扩大，交易稳定性和公平性通过智能体间的合作得到改善。

Conclusion: MADDPG框架能有效协调产消者决策，但价格操纵策略揭示了市场中的潜在不公平性，需进一步优化市场机制。

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the
tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena
such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to
resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to
free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven
solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to
tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate
clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA,
Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we
present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based
production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext
customer-support dataset and proprietary telecom datasets demonstrate high
prediction accuracy.

Motivation: 当前强化学习算法在多轮工具交互中未能平衡LLM的长时推理能力与工具使用熟练度，ARPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ARPO引入熵自适应机制和优势归因估计，动态平衡全局轨迹采样与步级采样，优化工具使用后的探索。

Result: 在13个基准测试中，ARPO表现优于轨迹级强化学习算法，仅用一半工具预算即实现性能提升。

Conclusion: ARPO为LLM代理在动态环境中的对齐提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Motivation: LLM缺乏对物理动态的直观理解，限制了其在需要因果推理的实际场景中的有效性。

Method: 引入CWMI框架，结合因果物理模块和因果干预损失，从多模态数据中学习因果关系。

Result: CWMI在PIQA和PhysiCa-Bench等零样本物理推理任务中显著优于现有LLM。

Conclusion: 诱导因果世界模型是构建更可靠、通用AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

Conclusion: CLoRA适合资源受限环境，强调评估持续学习方法时需考虑资源效率。

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

Result: FPO 在连续控制任务中表现优异，流模型能捕捉多模态动作分布，性能优于高斯策略。

Conclusion: FPO 为流模型在强化学习中的应用提供了灵活高效的框架，尤其在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

Motivation: 传统一阶优化方法（如SGD、Adam）在复杂损失地形中表现不佳，二阶方法计算成本高。DEO通过物理启发的曲率估计提升训练效率。

Method: DEO通过构造两个邻近点估计局部曲率，近似Hessian矩阵的最小特征向量，并周期性调整梯度方向以逃离鞍点。

Result: 在Transformer玩具模型上的初步实验表明，DEO性能与标准一阶方法相当，但能更好地处理复杂损失地形。

Conclusion: DEO展示了物理启发的曲率估计在高维神经网络训练中的潜力，为优化方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: FedSWA和FedMoSWA在高度异构数据下表现优于现有方法，具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization
capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the
generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity
on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-fold交叉验证中，实例重复使用导致冗余和不平衡，影响学习效果和模型比较。

Method: 引入Irredundant k-fold交叉验证，确保每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，保持分层且模型无关。

Result: 实验显示该方法性能与传统k-fold相当，但方差估计更准确，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Irredundant k-fold交叉验证是一种高效且平衡的方法，适用于模型分析。

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because

TL;DR: $K^4$ 是一种无监督、不依赖解析器的日志异常检测框架，通过高效的 k-NN 统计将日志嵌入转换为四维描述符，实现高性能在线检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志异常检测方法速度慢、依赖易出错的解析且评估协议不现实，需要改进。

Method: 使用 k-NN 统计将日志嵌入转换为四维描述符（精度、召回率、密度、覆盖率），支持轻量级检测器无需重新训练。

Result: 在更现实的在线评估协议下，$K^4$ 达到 AUROC 0.995-0.999，显著优于基线方法且速度快（训练<4秒，推理低至4μs）。

Conclusion: $K^4$ 是一种高效、快速的日志异常检测框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on
error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce
$K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance
online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact
four-dimensional descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using
efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a
more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art
(AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being
orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low
as 4 $\mu$s.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了持续学习中神经网络的特征学习动态，提出通过提高有效学习率来克服早期数据对后续任务的负面影响，并在多种任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中的'primacy bias'问题，即早期训练数据阻碍网络对后续任务的泛化能力。

Method: 通过增加有效学习率（参数与更新范数的比率）来诱导特征学习动态。

Result: 该方法在多种任务（如grokking、神经网络预热训练和强化学习）中促进了特征学习并提高了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 促进特征学习动态的方法是解决非平稳学习问题中'primacy bias'的有效途径。

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过引入偏移量保护联邦学习中模型隐私的方法，利用参数估计视角推导Fisher信息矩阵并使其奇异化，从而增加窃听者的估计难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护联邦学习中的模型隐私，防止窃听者获取敏感信息。

Method: 将模型学习视为参数估计问题，通过偏移量使Fisher信息矩阵奇异化，同时安全共享偏移量以保持模型准确性。

Result: 方案在数值实验中表现出更高的模型偏移量，且需要更少的带宽秘密信道。

Conclusion: 该方案能有效保护隐私并通过收敛测试，优于噪声注入方案。

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了社交媒体上用户生成内容（UGC）的监管问题，提出通过机制设计优化言论自由与减少内容操纵之间的平衡，并提供了近似最优解的实用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的用户生成内容容易被煽动和操纵，需要有效监管。但自动化内容审核会引发用户的策略性回应，因此需要在言论自由和减少社会扭曲之间找到平衡。

Method: 通过机制设计的视角，优化言论自由与内容操纵之间的权衡。尽管问题为NP难，但提出了近似最优解的实用方法，并提供了泛化保证。

Result: 提出了近似最优解的方法，并确定了有限离线数据量以有效逼近最优审核器。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体内容审核提供了一种平衡言论自由与减少操纵的实用方法，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将最优传输（OT）融入偏微分方程（PDE）算子学习的方法，通过将几何嵌入问题转化为OT问题，提高了灵活性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统几何学习方法通常将域表示为网格、图或点云，限制了灵活性。本文旨在通过OT方法实现更高效的几何嵌入。

Method: 将离散化网格推广为网格密度函数，通过OT问题将其映射到参考空间中的均匀密度，并在2D参数化潜在空间中计算。

Result: 在ShapeNet-Car、DrivAerNet-Car和FlowBench数据集上，该方法在精度和计算效率（时间和内存）上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 基于OT的实例依赖变形方法在处理几何变化大的数据集时表现出显著优势，为几何学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法，用于在使用数据增强时构建有效的置信区间，以改进强化学习中的离策略评估（OPE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，可靠的策略价值估计不确定性量化至关重要，但现有方法缺乏对数据增强带来的偏差的量化。

Method: 提出两种方法：一是针对特定初始状态的策略性能置信区间，采用新的高维状态MDP的共形预测方法；二是基于双重稳健估计和预测驱动推断的平均策略性能估计。

Result: 在多个模拟器和真实医疗数据集上的实验表明，新方法能有效覆盖真实值，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法为数据增强下的OPE提供了可靠的不确定性量化，适用于高风险领域。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

Result: 通过仿真实验验证了SEM的有效性，并将其应用于脑电数据，揭示了任务特定的脑区连接模式。

Conclusion: SEM为复杂系统的动态方程发现提供了通用且高效的方法，尤其在脑连接分析中展现了潜力。

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有方法在微调预训练模型时未能充分结构化嵌入空间以反映类内语义关系，而等效代码突变检测任务对嵌入空间质量要求高。

Method: 提出Cluster Purge Loss，结合交叉熵损失和动态调整边界的深度度量学习目标，优化类内差异。以UniXCoder为基础模型。

Result: 在等效突变检测领域达到最先进性能，并生成更可解释的嵌入空间。

Conclusion: 新框架通过调整类内差异显著提升了模型性能，为代码处理任务提供了更优的嵌入空间。

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

Result: 理论证明软信息共享降低泛化误差，实验表明Meta Fusion在模拟和实际应用中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Meta Fusion是一个模型无关的灵活框架，显著提升了多模态数据融合的效果。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

Motivation: Transformer的点积注意力机制计算密集且能耗高，需要更高效的替代方案。

Result: 在NLP、生物信息学和视觉任务中表现相当或优于点积注意力，同时能耗显著降低。

Conclusion: EcoTransformer是一种高效且节能的Transformer架构，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

Conclusion: Graded Transformer为复杂领域提供了可解释、高效的系统，推动了结构化深度学习的发展。

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven
models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex
domains.

Conclusion: PUCS框架及算法在实际应用中表现优异，理论分析验证了其性能。

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the
probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

Result: SVM在属性和产地预测任务中表现最优，产地预测的准确率和F1分数均超过91%。

Conclusion: 该研究为葡萄酒行业整合大数据和物联网提供了新思路，推动了“智能酒庄”的发展。

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart
Wineries'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN通常采用固定的聚合函数（如Mean、Max或Sum），缺乏理论依据，尤其在异质性图中表现不佳。现有方法依赖大量标注数据，而实际任务中标注数据稀缺。

Method: AMLP框架包括两个关键步骤：1）利用图重构方法促进高阶分组效应；2）使用单层网络编码不同程度的异质性，提升模型能力。

Result: 在节点聚类和分类任务上的实验表明，AMLP表现优异，适用于多种图学习场景。

Conclusion: AMLP通过无监督方式提升了GNN在异质性图上的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

TL;DR: MEVO是一个进化框架，通过结合小分子数据集和稀缺的蛋白质-配体复合物数据集，解决了结构药物设计（SBDD）中训练数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在计算机视觉和自然语言处理中取得了显著进展，但在SBDD中的应用因数据限制而受限。MEVO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MEVO包含三个关键组件：高保真VQ-VAE用于分子表示，扩散模型用于药效团引导的分子生成，以及基于物理评分函数的进化策略。

Result: MEVO成功生成了多种蛋白质靶点的高亲和力结合物，并在KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$抑制剂设计中表现出色。

Conclusion: MEVO是一个高效且数据利用率高的模型，适用于结构配体设计的多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASNN通过学习神经网络结构与测试精度之间的关系，提出改进架构的方法，并在实验中表现出优于随机搜索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络架构设计通常依赖启发式或搜索方法，缺乏通用的闭式函数映射结构与性能关系。

Method: 构建基于TensorFlow的模型数据集，训练ASNN以预测性能更优的架构，并通过迭代优化。

Result: ASNN在2层和3层架构中均提出优于原始数据的架构，提高了平均测试精度。

Conclusion: ASNN为神经网络架构优化提供了高效替代方案，有望实现自动化设计。

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重要性采样的偏移校正方法（IS²C），用于解决部分域适应（PDA）中的标签分布偏移问题，并通过理论证明和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域适应（PDA）中，简单的样本加权方法无法充分利用标记数据且容易过拟合，因此需要一种更有效的方法来校正标签分布偏移并提升模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出IS²C方法，通过从构建的采样域中采样新标记数据，使其标签分布与目标域一致，并结合最优传输理论进行条件分布对齐。

Result: 理论证明了IS²C能有效控制泛化误差，实验结果表明其在PDA基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IS²C方法在解决PDA问题时具有理论保证和实际优势，为标签分布偏移校正提供了新思路。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Conclusion: TINs通过将领域知识编码为神经网络结构，实现了传统技术分析与现代AI的融合。

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in
financial analysis are, in essence, special cases of neural networks with fixed
and interpretable weights. It is shown that nearly all such indicators, such as
moving averages, momentum-based oscillators, volatility bands, and other
commonly used technical constructs, can be reconstructed topologically as
modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are
introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as
price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific
knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of
technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the
legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.

Conclusion: Protein-SE(3)为未来算法快速原型设计提供数学抽象和评估标准。

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

Method: 提出了轨迹级奖励塑造（TLRS），通过测量部分生成表达式与专家设计公式的子序列级相似性来提供密集中间奖励，并引入奖励中心化机制降低训练方差。

Result: 在六种主要中美股票指数上的实验表明，TLRS显著提升了挖掘因子的预测能力，Rank Information Coefficient提高了9.29%，且计算效率大幅提升。

Conclusion: TLRS通过改进奖励机制，显著提升了强化学习在金融领域的应用效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

Result: 在室内定位问题上验证了方法的有效性和性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效利用有限数据，提供严格的覆盖保证。

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Result: 在标准回归基准和边界框定位任务中，生成的预测区间具有局部适应性，且通常比split-CP的更紧凑。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且准确的预测区间构建方式，适用于实际应用中的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MIPS的预训练框架，通过将聚合物表示为无限单体序列，并结合拓扑和空间信息，显著提升了聚合物性能预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模方法通常通过单体表示聚合物，但难以捕捉聚合过程中性质的变化，因此需要一种更全面的建模方法。

Method: MIPS框架结合了拓扑和空间信息，包括改进的消息传递机制（MPM）和图注意力机制（GAM），并引入局部图注意力（LGA）和骨架嵌入。

Result: 在八个不同的聚合物性能预测任务中，MIPS表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MIPS通过多模态融合和创新的拓扑建模方法，为聚合物性能预测提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM在教育中缺乏与教学原则（如帮助性、个性化、创造力）的对齐，EduAlign旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 分两阶段：1）标注8k教育交互数据并训练HPC-RM奖励模型；2）用GRPO方法微调LLM。

Result: 微调后的模型在HPC维度上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: EduAlign为开发更符合教育需求的AI导师提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，MH-GIN平均减少57%的填补误差，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MH-GIN通过多尺度依赖建模显著提升填补精度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of

overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑洞异常导致数据包丢失且无故障通知，影响网络连通性并造成经济损失，需高效检测方法。

Method: 结合Wasserstein生成对抗网络、注意力机制、LSTM和卷积层，通过潜在空间编码区分异常行为。

Result: 在真实网络数据测试中，WBHT的F1分数提升1.65%至58.76%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: WBHT高效且能检测未发现异常，适用于关键网络监控和安全防护。

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for
proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical
networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式训练算法DPPF，通过引入轻量级正则化器Inverse Mean Valley，平衡通信效率和模型性能，显著减少通信开销并提升泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 研究分布式数据并行训练中通信效率与模型性能的权衡问题，探索如何通过寻找平坦的损失区域提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出Inverse Mean Valley作为尖锐度度量，并将其作为正则化器融入训练目标，设计DPPF算法，结合推拉动态平衡通信与优化。

Result: DPPF在减少通信开销的同时优于其他通信高效方法，泛化性能优于本地梯度法和同步梯度平均，并能定位更平坦的极小值。

Conclusion: DPPF通过推拉动态和自稳定机制有效引导模型寻找平坦区域，理论分析支持其泛化保证和非凸收敛性。

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，AUC得分高达98.0%，且在独立测试集上保持高灵敏度和特异性。

Conclusion: ResCap-DBP结合全局蛋白质表示和先进深度学习架构，实现了可靠且可扩展的DBP预测。

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

Conclusion: 嵌入驱动的任务相似性估计具有潜力，可提升迁移学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological
systems, yet their high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate interactions
pose significant analytical challenges. Network-based approaches have advanced
multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant
relationships among molecular entities. While these methods are powerful for

BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end
network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional
representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular
networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of
multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction
techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of
downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN
architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g.,
scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick
adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively
documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics
network analysis in precision medicine.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer在复杂非线性回归任务中的上下文学习（ICL）能力，分析了注意力机制的动态变化及其受任务函数Lipschitz常数的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer在复杂非线性任务中的ICL能力，以弥补现有研究主要关注简单任务的不足。

Method: 通过分析注意力分数的阶段动态，引入新的证明技术，研究非线性函数类的Lipschitz常数对注意力权重的影响。

Result: 发现注意力分数在早期快速变化，后期逐渐收敛；Lipschitz常数L是影响收敛动态的关键因素，并推导了不同L值下的时间界限。

Conclusion: Transformer在ICL中能有效关注相关特征，即使任务函数未知，也展现了其强大的学习能力。

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

Result: 实验表明BOASF在加速模型选择和超参数优化的同时，性能优于现有自动机器学习方法。

Conclusion: BOASF是一种高效且鲁棒的自动化机器学习方法，适用于不同时间预算的场景。

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

Motivation: 稀疏正则化在信号处理中至关重要，但强稀疏性惩罚通常不可微，与梯度优化器冲突。

Method: 提出WEEP（弱凸包络分段惩罚），一种完全可微的稀疏正则化方法，具有L平滑性。

Result: 在信号和图像去噪任务中，WEEP表现优于L1范数和其他非凸稀疏正则化方法。

Conclusion: WEEP解决了统计性能与计算可行性之间的冲突，为稀疏正则化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

Result: 数值研究表明，DGMM在估计误差更小的同时，运行时间显著短于MM和GMM。

Conclusion: DGMM在统计效率、计算复杂度和数值稳定性之间取得了平衡，适用于高维数据和高阶矩需求场景。

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of
DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while
requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will
be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.

Result: 基于Shapley值的稀疏化方法在保持预测性能的同时显著降低图复杂度。

Conclusion: Shapley值方法为图稀疏化提供了理论鲁棒性和实际效率提升，适用于GNN推理。

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型有望提升全球降水监测的准确性。

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法在超图中表现不佳，因其破坏了高阶结构信息。HIAL旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在七个公开数据集上，HIAL在性能、效率、通用性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HIAL为超图主动学习提供了高效且强大的新范式。

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and
robustness, establishing an efficient and powerful new paradigm for active
learning on hypergraphs.

Result: 在多种基准测试中，MoKGR在传导和归纳设置下均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 个性化路径探索能有效提升知识图谱推理的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

Conclusion: DmC框架有效解决了目标数据有限时的跨域离线强化学习问题。

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本和全数据集场景下优于现有方法，对新政策泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 基于先例的方法显著提升了护栏的灵活性和适应性，适用于多变政策需求。

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉高阶图特征、保持特征多样性和保留细粒度结构信息方面存在不足，MPCCL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多尺度粗化策略和一对多对比学习范式，结合图重建损失和KL散度，确保节点表征的跨尺度一致性。

Result: 在ACM数据集上NMI提升15.24%，在Citeseer、Cora和DBLP等小规模数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: MPCCL通过创新方法有效解决了图聚类的关键问题，性能显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,
involving sequential surface-by-surface computations, which can be
computationally intensive. We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages
implicit neural representations to model optical systems with greater
efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

Motivation: 现有张量分解方法在组公平性方面表现不佳，导致性能下降，需要一种新方法来平衡公平性和准确性。

Method: 提出STAFF方法，通过增强稀疏张量中的实体来缓解不平衡和组偏见，优化完成误差和公平性。

Result: STAFF在多种数据集和模型下表现最佳，MSE和MADE分别比次优基线低36%和59%。

Conclusion: STAFF在张量分解中实现了公平性和准确性的最佳权衡。

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Conclusion: 结论是近似遗忘算法存在隐私风险，而提出的双阶段框架在保持高效遗忘的同时显著降低了隐私攻击的准确性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically
produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results
demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS
across diverse vision tasks.

Conclusion: 该模型展示了深度生成模型在群体基因组学中的潜力，特别是在处理Pool-Seq数据和LD估计方面的优势。

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.

Motivation: Cholesky分解在对称正定矩阵的线性系统中广泛应用，但其数值稳定性可通过改进枢轴选择策略进一步提升。

Method: 提出新的枢轴选择策略，基于贝叶斯非参数推断中的贪婪熵最大化思想，并优化实现方式。

Result: 新策略在稀疏回归和迭代求解器任务中表现优于传统方法，计算开销几乎可忽略。

Conclusion: 改进的枢轴选择策略显著提升了Cholesky分解的效率，适用于高斯过程等任务。

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed

analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness

manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

Motivation: 前列腺癌是第二大男性恶性肿瘤，需要先进的诊断工具。

Method: 结合BERT（处理临床文本）和随机森林（处理数值数据），采用新型多模态融合策略。

Result: 在PLCO-NIH数据集上表现优异，尤其是对中期癌症阶段（Class 2/3召回率显著提升）。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能、计算效率和临床可解释性之间取得了平衡，适用于前列腺癌诊断。

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced
diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for
textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance
rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value.
This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance
(F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing
critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的嵌入集成方法（UEC），通过将确定性嵌入转化为概率嵌入并计算自适应权重，提高了性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型在不同领域表现不一，且现有集成方法未考虑模型不确定性，限制了鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: UEC将确定性嵌入转化为概率嵌入，基于不确定性计算自适应权重，并引入不确定性感知的相似性函数。

Result: 在检索、分类和语义相似性基准测试中，UEC显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UEC通过不确定性建模，为嵌入集成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

Motivation: 理解幻觉信号在令牌序列中的变化，以改进实时过滤和针对性修正。

Method: 利用RAGTruth语料库的令牌级注释和重现的逻辑值，分析幻觉信号与令牌位置的关系。

Result: 首个幻觉令牌的信号更强且更易检测。

Conclusion: 研究为令牌级幻觉检测提供了新见解，并公开了分析框架和代码。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉建筑间的相似性和空间关系，为能耗预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

Conclusion: 首次将状态空间几何与动作空间维度联系起来，为连续空间强化学习提供理论支持，并通过实验验证其应用价值。

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主观或依赖专业设备，需客观、数据驱动的检测手段。

Method: 使用124名参与者的EEG信号和临床数据，训练BiSAM模型，测试三种模态（信号、描述、多模态）。

Result: 多模态模型表现最佳，BiSAM-8和BiSAM-4分类准确率达88%。

Conclusion: 多模态方法为PDFOG+检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于临床监测和早期诊断。

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据流中存在分布演化、高维标签空间、稀疏标签和复杂标签依赖等问题，且概念漂移影响标签相关性和不平衡比例，需要适应性强的模型。

Method: iHOMER采用增量式层次化方法，通过在线聚类和树型学习器动态划分标签空间，并集成漂移检测机制。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上，iHOMER比5种全局基线方法性能提升23%，比12种局部基线方法提升32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER在在线多标签分类中表现出色，具有动态适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

TL;DR: LANTERN是一种模块化架构，通过融合自适应调查响应和上下文信号来建模用户行为，优于仅依赖调查的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调查方法因用户疲劳和不完整响应而受限，需要结合上下文信号以更全面地捕捉用户行为。

Method: LANTERN采用选择性门控、残差连接和跨注意力机制，将调查数据作为主要信号，仅在相关时引入外部模态。

Result: LANTERN在多标签预测中优于仅依赖调查的基线方法，并通过消融实验验证了选择性模态依赖的优势。

Conclusion: LANTERN为以调查为中心的行为建模提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本场景下显著优于基线模型，尤其在数据稀缺时表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为CPI预测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于实际药物开发中的挑战性场景。

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 解决PINNs在四阶偏微分方程中误差停滞的问题，突破精度天花板，推动其在工程应用中的采用。

Method: 结合截断傅里叶级数和深度神经网络，通过两阶段优化策略（Adam和L-BFGS）及自适应权重平衡实现超精度收敛。

Result: 在Euler-Bernoulli梁方程中实现了L2误差低至1.94×10^-7，比标准PINNs提升17倍，比传统数值方法提升15-500倍。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计，机器学习可以在科学计算中达到或超越传统数值方法的精度，为超精度计算开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

Method: 使用激活修补技术分析模型关键组件，研究早期MLP层和中层MHA层对角色信息的处理。

Result: 早期MLP层不仅关注输入句法结构，还处理语义内容；中层MHA层利用这些信息塑造输出；特定注意力头关注种族和颜色身份。

Conclusion: 角色信息通过早期MLP层和中层MHA层影响模型推理，特定注意力头可能引入偏见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.

Motivation: 解决时间序列分析中域偏移问题，现有UDA方法忽略特征的内在组成。

Method: DARSD包含三个组件：对抗性学习的共同不变基、原型伪标签机制和混合对比优化策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于12种UDA算法，35/53跨域场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: DARSD通过特征分解和优化策略有效解决了域适应问题。

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: SAE Debias是一种轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于减少文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的性别偏见，通过稀疏自编码器识别并抑制性别相关方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I扩散模型常表现出性别偏见，例如职业与性别的刻板关联。现有方法依赖CLIP过滤或提示工程，效果有限且需模型特定调整。

Method: SAE Debias在特征空间中操作，无需重新训练或修改架构，利用预训练的k稀疏自编码器识别性别相关方向，并在推理中抑制这些方向。

Result: 在多个T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion系列）上评估表明，SAE Debias显著减少性别偏见，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: SAE Debias是首个利用稀疏自编码器识别和干预T2I模型中性别偏见的工作，为构建公平的生成式AI提供了可解释的工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: SmallThinker是一系列专为本地设备设计的轻量级大语言模型（LLMs），通过创新的架构设计解决了计算能力弱、内存有限和存储速度慢的问题，实现了在普通CPU上的高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有LLMs依赖GPU云基础设施的范式，为本地设备设计高效、低资源消耗的模型。

Method: 采用两级稀疏结构（MoE和稀疏前馈网络）、预注意力路由器和NoPE-RoPE混合稀疏注意力机制，优化计算、存储和内存效率。

Result: SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B和SmallThinker-21B-A3B在性能上超越更大模型，并在普通CPU上实现每秒20个令牌的推理速度，内存占用仅为1GB和8GB。

Conclusion: SmallThinker通过本地设备优化的设计，显著降低了硬件需求，为轻量级LLMs的部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

*Henri Arno,Thomas Demeester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用非结构化数据估计个性化治疗效果的方法，通过引入近似'插件'方法和两种理论基础的估计器，解决了混杂偏差和抽样偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖结构化协变量，限制了其在非结构化数据（如医疗临床笔记或图像）中的应用潜力。

Method: 1. 提出近似'插件'方法，直接基于非结构化数据的神经表示训练；2. 引入两种理论基础的估计器，利用混杂因子的结构化测量避免偏差；3. 针对非代表性子集的抽样偏差，提出回归校正方法。

Result: 实验表明，插件方法在大型非结构化数据集上表现优异，尽管方法简单。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了个性化治疗效果估计的应用范围，特别是在非结构化数据丰富的领域如医疗。

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDM-OC是一种新型框架，通过正交约束和模块化增量合并，实现无干扰、可逆的模型组合，支持持续学习和合规性要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型合并和持续学习方法中的任务干扰、灾难性遗忘和不可逆性问题。

Method: 将任务特定模型编码为共享基础的增量，并投影到正交子空间以避免冲突，通过梯度优化合并增量。

Result: 在视觉和自然语言处理任务中，MDM-OC在准确性、反向迁移和分离保真度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MDM-OC为模块化和合规的AI系统设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出LoRA-PAR框架，通过双系统分区数据和参数，减少参数使用同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法未针对不同任务需求优化数据和参数分配，受《思考，快与慢》启发，提出双系统分区方法。

Method: 分类任务数据并分区参数，采用两阶段微调策略：SFT训练系统1任务，RL优化系统2任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少参数使用的同时，性能优于或匹配现有PEFT基线。

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR框架通过双系统分区和两阶段微调，高效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DNN黑盒特性在高风险领域部署受限的问题，提供兼具高性能和透明性的模型。

Method: 构建可组合的数学函数网络（CFNs），支持序列、并行和条件组合，利用梯度下降高效训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上达到96.24%准确率，优于现有可解释模型。

Conclusion: CFNs结合了深度学习的表达能力和数学函数的可解释性，适用于高性能与可问责性并重的场景。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统机器学习（KRR）和深度学习模型（GNN、TGNN）在预测认知能力上的表现，发现任务型fMRI优于静息态fMRI，且结合结构和功能连接的GNN表现最佳。

Motivation: 通过神经影像数据预测认知能力，有助于理解认知的神经机制，并推动精准医疗和神经精神疾病的早期检测。

Method: 使用KRR、GNN和TGNN模型，基于静息态、工作记忆和语言任务fMRI数据，评估其预测性能。

Result: 任务型fMRI表现更优，GNN结合结构和功能连接效果最佳，但TGNN在静息态数据中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 选择合适的模型架构和特征表示对充分利用神经影像数据的时空信息至关重要，多模态图感知DL模型和Transformer方法具有潜力。

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

Motivation: 探索更高效的异常定位方法，减少计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 固定项方法在独立观测下有效，依赖观测需进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization
test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for
all cases tested. A proof demonstrates these conclusions must be true for all
independent observation cases. For dependent observation cases, no proof is

Motivation: 传统FMA在优化过程中性能停滞，原因是数据集增大导致新数据点的影响被稀释。

Method: 提出一种序列数据集构建方法，仅保留最近添加的指定数量数据点。

Result: 数值实验表明，改进的FMA能以更少的函数评估获得更低成本的解。

Conclusion: 限制数据集大小能有效提升FMA的优化性能。

Abstract: Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes
the output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is
unknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to
this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

Motivation: 解决运动想象脑电信号解码中因受试者间差异大和标记数据有限导致的负迁移和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 利用BFM动态选择相关源域，并采用Cauchy-Schwarz和Conditional CS散度进行特征级和决策级对齐。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上优于现有方法，验证了BFM选择的可扩展性和高效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了运动想象脑电信号的解码性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

Result: 实验表明，减去注意力矩阵的单位矩阵能提升语言模型和简单视觉Transformer的验证性能。

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer提供了新的概率视角，并通过图扩散步骤展示了性能改进的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.

Motivation: 现有多任务优化技术过于关注冲突解决，而忽略了表示空间中任务互补性的潜力。

Conclusion: Rep-MTL通过表示层优化有效提升了多任务学习的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

Motivation: 解决CT图像中肺结节（良性vs恶性）分类的挑战，提高分类准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用三种预训练网络（EfficientNet V2 S、MobileViT XXS、DenseNet201）结合自定义分类头，采用两阶段注意力机制和轻量级元学习器优化预测。通过动态焦点损失、MixUp增强和测试时增强解决类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为肺癌筛查的自动化辅助工具，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.
