Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

However, it rarely predicts how\na model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and\nchallenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution\n(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between\nattention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models\nindependently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit\nseveral distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse\npopulation for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple\nobservational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In\nparticular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the\nmodel is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the\nrule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according\nto ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further\ninterpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior."}

We employ an encoder, trained on\nsynthetic pointclouds, to estimate the tool's affordance states--specifically,\nhow different tool configurations (e.g., tweezer opening angles) enable\ngrasping of objects of varying sizes--from input point clouds, thereby enabling\nprecise tool manipulation. We also utilize a privilege-informed heuristic\npolicy to generate replay buffer, improving the training efficiency of the\nhigh-level policy. We validate our approach through real-world experiments,\nshowing that the robot can effectively manipulate a tweezer-like tool to grasp\nobjects of diverse shapes and sizes with a 70.8 % success rate. This study\nhighlights the potential of RL to advance dexterous robotic manipulation of\narticulated tools."}

However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further\npropose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where\na novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from\ngenerated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that\nleverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more\nreliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.\nExperimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field.

However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color\nspace-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due\nto the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)\ncolor space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red\nand black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color\nspace for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV\ncolor map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism.

ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels.

This paper presents an ensemble\nembedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained\nmeta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.\nWe evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring\ncache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our\nensemble approach achieves a 92\\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent\nqueries while maintaining an 85\\% accuracy in correctly rejecting\nnon-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble\nembedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in\ndistinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to\nmore effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in\nLLM-based systems."}

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning\nhave become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI\nface challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to\nsubjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology\ncaptions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce\na novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from\nhistopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor\ngenerates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically\nclustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting\nrepresentative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph\nby connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and\napply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The\naggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space\nthrough a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large\nlanguage model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric\ndatasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for\nclassification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569\nfor captioning.

Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,\nindependently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and\nreconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and\nenhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse\nmultimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge\ndistillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks.

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.
