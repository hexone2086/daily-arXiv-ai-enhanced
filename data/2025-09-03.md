Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AMMKD框架，通过多模态特征融合、多教师知识蒸馏和自适应优化，实现轻量高效的图像文本检索模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言预训练模型在移动设备部署受限，需要解决模型尺寸大和计算复杂度过高的问题

Method: 多模态特征融合网络提取图像文本特征，多教师蒸馏框架预训练两个CLIP教师模型，使用KL散度进行概率分布匹配，自适应动态权重方案处理多目标优化

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证，AMMKD在显著降低模型复杂度的同时实现优越性能

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，证明了其有效性和灵活性

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出新的微表情输入模态MESTI和注意力网络MEGANet，在微表情识别任务中创造了新的最高准确率纪录


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的微表情输入模态如Apex Frame、光流和动态图像无法有效捐捕细微而瞬间的面部微动作，导致性能不佳

Method: 设计了MESTI动态输入模态，将视频序列转换为单张图像保留微动作特征；提出MEGANet网络，通过梯度注意力块提升细粒度运动特征提取能力

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到了状态上最好的结果，MEGANet与MESTI组合获得了目前最高准确率，为微表情识别设定了新的标杆

Conclusion: MESTI作为优质输入模态和MEGANet作为先进识别网络具有强大潜力，为各种应用场景中的微表情识别系统探索了新路径

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion使用离散扩散语言模型生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构，在98%稀疏度的Minecraft房屋数据上表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构面临立方内存扩展和类别不平衡的挑战，需要新的生成方法

Method: 将体素视为token，使用离散扩散语言模型生成空间连贯的3D结构，处理高度稀疏数据

Result: 在3D-Craft数据集的Minecraft房屋结构上，Scaffold Diffusion能生成逼真且连贯的结构，优于现有基线方法和自回归方法

Conclusion: 离散扩散是3D稀疏体素生成建模的有前景框架，能够有效处理高度稀疏的多类别体素数据

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SGLC框架解决高分辨率图像去雾问题，通过全局特征生成器和局部特征增强器的组合，在保持全局上下文的同时增强局部细节，显著提升PSNR指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型在处理高分辨率图像时性能下降明显，主要因为难以有效结合全局上下文信息和局部精细细节

Method: SGLC框架包含全局特征生成器(GFG)产生初步去雾结果，局部特征增强器(LFE)细化局部细节，可集成到现有去雾网络中

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上实验显示PSNR有显著提升，证明该方法能有效处理大规模图像中的雾霾

Conclusion: SGLC是模型无关的全局-局部特征融合机制，能同时利用场景级线索和细粒度细节，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于UNI基础模型的自监督学习方法在158种药物安全评估研究中实现了肾脏异常检测，达到0.62的AUC值和89%的阻性预测值，有力排除正常分析从而降低药物开发成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预临床药物开发中需要检测肾脏异常，而传统方法需要人工检查数千张全片图像，过程耗时耗费且大部分样本并无异常。

Method: 采用UNI基础模型提取特征，对比了简单k近邻分类器和自监督学习方法的性能。自监督学习方法能够在无标签数据上进行异常检测。

Result: 简单k近邻分类器性能仅为随机水平，而自监督学习方法达到了AUC 0.62和NPV 89%的效果，显著超越了随机检测。

Conclusion: 这种自监督学习方法有望用于药物安全评估中排除正常样本，显著降低药物开发的时间和费用成本。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Conclusion: 这项研究突出了VLLM模型在复杂环境中的补健性问题，提供的数据集和分析为进一步改进模型稳健性提供了价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过生成式模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，结合视觉编码器和多模态聚合，提升了文本到图像检索的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP等视觉-语言模型在文本和图像表征空间存在模态间间隔的问题，提高语义类别检索的性能

Method: 两步方法：首先用生成模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，然后用视觉模型评估图像相似性，并通过聚合网络结合多个生成图像和多模态相似度

Result: 综合评估显示该方法在文本到图像检索任务上持续超过仅依靠文本查询的检索方法

Conclusion: 通过涉及生成式模型、视觉编码器和多模态聚合的结合方法，有效缩小了文本与图像间的模态间隔，显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [11] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM基准测试和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物特征信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时，即使未被明确要求，也会推断并泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），这在现实应用和社会敏感领域存在严重隐私风险。目前缺乏公开的数据集和基准来全面评估或缓解这种生物特征泄露问题。

Method: 1) 引入PRISM基准测试，评估模型在两个方面：拒绝生物特征相关查询和在保持语义忠实度的同时避免一般响应中的隐式生物特征泄露；2) 对广泛使用的LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，发现预训练和指令数据中存在大量生物特征泄露；3) 构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地从LLaVA数据集中移除显式和隐式生物特征信息来创建首个隐私保护的多模态大语言模型训练数据集。

Result: 在PRISM上的评估揭示了不同MLLM模型在各种生物特征属性上的泄露情况，详细展示了隐私违规行为。在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型显著减少了生物特征泄露。

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为多模态大语言模型的隐私对齐开发和评估设立了新标准，提供了公开可用的数据集和基准测试工具来促进隐私保护研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME是一个新颖的跨模态对齐方法，通过构建自我中心的世界模型来增强视觉语言模型在动态环境中的时空推理和泛化能力，在导航任务上取得了1%-3%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在动态开放环境中的时空推理不足问题，特别是在任务导向导航和具身问答等任务中，由于缺乏细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解而表现受限。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：跨模态对齐框架连接对象、空间表示和视觉语义；动态隐式认知地图通过世界嵌入激活任务相关的几何-语义记忆；基于指令的导航推理框架利用具身先验进行长期规划和高效探索。

Conclusion: VEME通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，有效增强了视觉语言模型在未知动态环境中的泛化能力和推理性能，为具身智能的发展提供了重要思路。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出多模态深度学习框架，结合乳腺超声图像和临床数据，提高叶状肿瘤良恶性分类准确率，减少不必要的手术切除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤在影像学上与良性纤维腺瘤相似，术前分类困难，常导致不必要的手术切除，需要开发更准确的诊断方法。

Method: 开发双分支神经网络，融合超声图像特征和患者元数据，使用类别感知采样和分层交叉验证防止类别不平衡和数据泄露。

Result: 多模态方法优于单模态基线，ConvNeXt和ResNet18表现最佳，AUC-ROC分别达0.9427和0.9349，F1分数分别为0.6720和0.7294。

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为无创诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策。

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational

*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FHT2SP算法，一种快速且高精度的霍夫变换算法，在保持常数有界误差的同时实现近最优计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速霍夫变换算法在任意图像尺寸下精度会随尺度恶化，而高精度算法计算成本接近立方复杂度，需要平衡计算效率和精度

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（超越原始幂次方约束），并集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过超像素尺寸的适当选择实现优化

Result: FHT2SP算法达到近最优计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像尺寸无关的常数有界近似误差，可通过元参数控制

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了霍夫变换中计算复杂度与精度之间的权衡问题，为各种应用提供了高效且准确的解决方案

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种语言导向的生成式视觉系统，用于制造业中的残余轮廓检测，通过条件GAN和视觉-语言模型实现CAD级精度。


<details>

Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统面临噪声、材料变异性和非受控拍照条件的挑战，传统边缘检测器和手动管道效果有限。

Method: 系统分为三步：数据获取和预处理，使用条件GAN生成轮廓，通过视觉-语言模型进行多模态轮廓精炼，采用人在循环设计标准化提示。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上，系统提高了轮廓保真度，改善边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少手动追踪。GPT-image-1在结构准确性和感知质量方面都超过Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了VLM导向的生成式工作流在超越传统管道限制、推进工业计算机视觉方面的潜力。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论和参数高效微调的新方法LIMO，用于视觉-语言模型的转导式少样本学习，显著提升了CLIP模型在少样本场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前转导式少样本学习主要关注纯视觉模型，在基础视觉-语言模型(VLMs)领域仍处于起步阶段。现有方法较少且需要专门针对VLMs的转导方法。

Method: 提出语言感知信息最大化(LIMO)损失函数，包含三个互补项：视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚项和标准交叉熵损失。同时探索参数高效微调(PEFT)策略。

Result: LIMO方法大幅超越最近的转导式少样本CLIP方法，相比最佳归纳方法也有显著提升。参数高效微调策略带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了信息论概念和参数高效微调在转导式少样本学习中的有效性，为VLMs的少样本学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen是一个通过显式建模核形态和空间组织来提升组织病理学图像领域泛化能力的对比学习方法，能够学习对域偏移具有鲁棒性的癌症表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学全切片图像存在机构间差异，而病理学家依赖域不变的形态学特征进行诊断。受此启发，研究者希望通过显式建模生物学上稳健的核形态和空间组织来学习对域偏移具有弹性的癌症表征。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，在监督对比学习框架中整合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码，通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表征，优先考虑核形态异常、空间组织等诊断特征。还结合随机权重平均(SWA)来增强分布外鲁棒性。

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类。该方法对图像损坏（如染色伪影）和对抗攻击表现出弹性，不仅展示了OOD泛化能力，还解决了数字病理学中深度学习系统的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过显式建模生物学相关的形态学特征，成功提升了组织病理学图像的领域泛化能力，为数字病理学中的深度学习系统提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型中视觉token序列导致计算成本和内存开销大幅增加，现有剪枝方法存在重复保留问题

Method: 仅对视觉token进行剪枝，使用互信息基于的策略移除语义不对齐的视觉token，通过购弊算法最大化嵌入空间中的预期成对距离来剪枝重复token

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B模型上减少88.9%的token数量，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持了强劲的性能

Conclusion: 通过重点剪枝视觉token并保持跨模态对齐和信息多样性，可以在大幅降低计算成本的同时维持模型性能

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Motivation: 当前红外与可见光图像融合研究主要关注性能提升，但忽略了实时融合设备的实际应用需求，需要开发高效的融合方法。

Method: 采用低阶近似编码和高层联合上下文场景编码的查找表结构，提出高效的LUT蒸馏策略替代传统量化方法，将多模态融合网络性能集成到MM-LUT模型中。

Conclusion: 大量实验验证了该融合方法的优越性、可靠性和稳定性，为实时图像融合应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 现有单域泛化方法忽视了目标部署环境的文本描述这个易获得资源，而这种文本元数据可以指导模型向目标域泛化

Method: 提出STAR模块：1）利用CLIP等视觉-语言模型从目标文本描述提取子空间；2）通过谱投影保留与目标线索对齐的方向，废除源域特定噪音；3）视觉-语言蓄粉对齐和特征空间Mixup

Result: 在多个图像分类和物体检测数据集上验证了STAR方法的优劢性

Conclusion: 最小化的文本元数据可以在严重数据限制下显著提升模型泛化能力，为在未见目标环境中部署健壮模型开启了新方向

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Motivation: 高光谱图像(HSI)去噪是重要预处理步骤，但如何有效利用HSI的低维子空间物理特性（低秩和稀疏表示）同时保持图像细节是一个挑战。

Method: 提出ILRNet，在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块(RMM)，将特征图转换到小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值处理(SVT)，自适应学习参数，并采用迭代细化过程。

Result: 实验结果表明ILRNet在合成和真实噪声去除任务中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ILRNet成功整合了模型驱动和数据驱动的优势，能够灵活有效地捕捉不同场景下的低秩特性，并保持图像细节，为HSI去噪提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化来增强模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活导向防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能欠佳且可能降低视觉定位能力，需要更有效的防御方案。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段从多样化数据源计算自适应层特定导向向量；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化细化这些向量，整合毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励。

Result: SPO-VLM有效增强了对抗攻击的安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强性能，不损害视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过结合轻量级缓解基础和深度策略优化，在效率和效果之间取得了良好平衡，为VLM安全防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云数据稀缺导致的大模型预训练困难，以及现有方法通过"高到低"映射导致空间几何信息丢失和缺乏通用跨模态适配框架的问题。

Method: 使用点嵌入聚合局部几何特征，采用置换不变特征捕获相对位置，通过共享权重的提示生成器动态产生点提示，与冻结预训练模型拼接。

Result: APPT方法能够以少量参数微调预训练模型，直接处理点云数据，保持空间几何特征，提供丰富的全局结构信息。

Conclusion: 该方法为任意模态到3D点云分析的通用适配提供了有效解决方案，减少了计算开销，避免了异构图谱映射的信息损失。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NoiseCutMix方法，将CutMix概念引入扩散模型噪声估计过程，生成自然高分辨率的多类别融合图像用于数据增强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix等方法在多类别图像融合时会产生不自然的边界，需要利用扩散模型生成高质量图像的能力来创建更自然的融合数据

Method: 在扩散模型中对两个不同类别的估计噪声进行部分组合，生成具有两个类别融合特征的自然高分辨率图像

Result: 在分类实验中验证了方法的有效性，相比传统多类别融合数据增强方法和随机图像生成方法表现更好

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix能够生成自然的多类别融合图像，为数据增强提供了新的有效途径

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云分割需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且耗时。相比之下，2D图像数据集更容易获得且规模更大，希望通过跨模态知识蒸馏减少对3D标注的依赖。

Method: 提出UDAKD和FSKD两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法，利用2D-3D对应关系，将预训练2D模型的知识迁移到3D网络。使用自校准卷积作为域适应模块的基础，保持模态通用信息，过滤模态特定细节。

Conclusion: 跨模态知识蒸馏可以有效减少对3D标注数据的依赖，利用丰富的2D图像数据提升3D点云分割性能，为自动驾驶场景的语义分割提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统叙事分析需要研究人员将各种数据转化为手写叙事故事，参与者也需要参与大量文档的成员检查，双重负担较重，需要更高效和参与者友好的叙事制作方法。

Method: 提出NAME范式，开发演员定位和形状模块以促进合理的图像生成，设计包含三个关键维度的评估指标来客观衡量生成角色的感知质量和叙事一致性。

Result: 在不同数据划分方案下均表现最优：仅使用0.96%数据就将FID分数从195降至152；在相同数据量下，70:30划分时FID从175降至152，95:5划分时从96降至49；新指标得分3.62优于基线的2.66。

Conclusion: NAME范式成功减轻了叙事分析的认知负担，通过少量数据就能生成高质量叙事图像，为叙事探究领域提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁剧烈的视角变化导致物体外观变化大和部分遮挡严重，现有方法难以实现精确定位

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1）Top-down Attention Guidance利用类别token提供高层上下文和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2）Egocentric Augmentation通过替换查询物体和重排视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化；3）CT损失确保不同增强场景下的稳定定位

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理自我中心挑战，显著超越基线方法

Conclusion: HERO-VQL方法受人类认知过程启发，通过注意力引导和一致性训练，成功解决了自我中心视频中的物体定位难题

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型DCDM用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，适应不同剂量水平无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露和检查时间，但会导致噪声增加和成像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要一种灵活的重建方法适应不同剂量水平。

Method: DCDM包含核变换器约束(NTC)和编码连接约束(ENC)两个模块。NTC利用核范数近似矩阵秩最小化，将低秩特性集成到Transformer架构中；ENC利用压缩特征表示编码和控制预训练扩散模型。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)上优于最先进方法，在未知DRF场景中泛化良好，即使在1%全剂量的超低剂量水平也表现优异。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，提高了重建灵活性，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有模型参数，在超低剂量PET重建中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景视频应用近年来在VR和遥感领域广泛使用，但其广视角容易导致不想要的物体出现在视频中。现有的视频修复方法多假设处理普通视频，没有考虑全景视频的折射变形问题。

Method: 提出DAOVI模型，包含两个核心模块：1）基于海洋距离评估形象空间中时序运动信息的模块；2）特征空间中的深度感知特征传播模块，专门处理全景视频的几何折射。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的方法在数量和质量上都显著超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI模型能够有效处理全景视频的折射问题，实现自然的物体移除同时保持空间和时序一致性，为全景视频处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: 通过利用视频生成模型提供多视角监督信号，结合视频微调和高分辨率生成技术，能够有效提升单目视视频中人体演员重建的细节质量和新视角生成能力

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练的推理加速方法，通过金字塔token合并和KV缓存压缩技术，在保持性能的同时显著提升视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型(VLMs)推理过程存在效率低下的问题，特别是在编码和解码阶段都需要处理大量token，导致推理延迟高、吞吐量低，限制了实际部署。

Method: 1. 编码阶段：提出金字塔token合并技术，分层减少不同LLM层的token数量，仅保留关键token；2. 解码阶段：提出KV缓存压缩技术，移除不必要的缓存以提高网络吞吐量。

Result: 仅保留35%图像token时保持100%性能，仅保留3%图像token时保持约98%性能；网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍；长序列生成时推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM是一种简单有效的训练免费加速方法，能够显著提升VLMs的推理效率，使大模型推理速度超过小模型，有望促进实际部署应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Conclusion: SemaMIL通过整合语义重排序和语义引导状态空间建模，在保持组织学意义的同时有效提升了全局建模能力，为计算病理学提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

Motivation: 解决年龄估计中标签模糊性的挑战，现有方法忽视了不同年龄阶段存在的不同程度模糊性。

Method: 提出SA-LDL算法，基于嵌入相似性分析发现标签模糊性具有明显的阶段模式，采用阶段适应性方差建模和加权损失函数来捕捉模糊性结构。

Result: 在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到MAE 1.74和2.15的竞争性能效果。

Conclusion: SA-LDL能够有效处理年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，通过考虑阶段性特征显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评估基准，覆盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个维度，包含1,563个标注样本，评估了28个模型，发现当前最佳模型准确率仅57%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，需要构建更全面的评估体系。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据流水线构建高质量偏好数据集，包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组，评估三类多模态奖励模型（生成式、判别式、半标量）。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o准确率57.0%，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B仅53.3%；发现RL训练不一定带来跨模态泛化优势，推理时缩放对多数模型有益，视频帧数变化对不同模型影响各异。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频多模态奖励模型提供了具有挑战性的评估基准，揭示了当前模型性能仍有很大提升空间，为未来发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STVH和M-STVH两种时空视频哈希方法，用于细粒度群体活动视频检索，能够同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，并在多焦点特征学习方面取得优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频数据爆炸式增长，现有方法只能检索整个视频而无法实现活动粒度检索，需要解决复杂场景下快速检索群体活动的迫切需求。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕获群体视觉特征和位置特征的时空演化；M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现层次特征集成，联合关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的STVH和M-STVH方法有效解决了细粒度群体活动视频检索问题，能够适应不同检索需求场景。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

TL;DR: TRUST是一个针对超声图像的token驱动双流框架，通过数据视角和模型视角选择合适的目标token，在保持源内容的同时转换目标域风格，提升下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同设备采集的超声图像风格差异导致下游任务性能下降的问题，现有UI2I方法未能充分考虑下游任务需求来选择最相关的风格特征

Method: 提出token驱动的双流框架(TRUST)，包含Token-dRiven模块从数据视角选择合适的目标token，从模型视角通过行为镜像损失识别最优目标token，并在源编码器中注入辅助提示来匹配下游行为

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有UI2I方法

Conclusion: TRUST框架能有效保持内容完整性同时转换风格，显著提升跨设备超声图像的下游任务性能

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Motivation: 解决AIaaS场景下无法获取黑盒模型权重、训练数据或logits时，如何有效训练本地模型的问题，特别是在只能获得one-hot预测的现实约束下。

Method: 提出ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC)方法，利用DINOv2注意力图通过熵评分动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理，为伪标签生成选择信息丰富的尺度。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，该方法在黑盒监督下取得了显著改进，仅需one-hot API预测即可实现有效蒸馏。

Conclusion: ATGC方法成功解决了开放词汇模型的分辨率敏感性挑战，为黑盒模型蒸馏提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量语义分割中存在原型-特征缠羁和背景-增量缠羁两大问题，现有方法依靠视觉特征学习但缺乏足够线索来区分目标，导致噪声和错误

Method: 提出LBD框架，利用预训练视觉-语言模型的类语义前知来导模型自主解耦特征：语言导向的原型解耦（以手工编写的文本特征作为拓扑模板）和流形相互背景解耦（使用多个可学习原型和基于面具池化的监督）

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上达到状态最佳性能，尤其在多步场景中表现优异

Conclusion: 通过涉及软提示微调和编码器适配改进，成功缩小了CLIP在密集任务和稀疏任务之间的能力差距，为解决CISS中的语义缠羁问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

TL;DR: BrainFM是一个模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，通过创新的"轻度到重度"生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，能够处理多种脑成像任务，包括图像合成、分割、距离估计、偏置场估计和配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（如MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出"轻度到重度"主体内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，证明BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态中都具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM作为一个模态无关的基础模型，能够直接应用于多种基础脑成像任务，解决了现有方法在未校准模态中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决DiffusionDet在上下文相关场景中仅依赖局部特征条件化的局限性，提升细粒度目标检测在挑战性视觉领域（如车辆损伤评估）的性能。

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)，使用独立的专用编码器生成全局场景上下文，通过交叉注意力机制让每个目标提案都能关注到场景级理解信息。

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中显著超越现有最先进模型，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: CAF框架通过全局上下文与局部特征的融合，有效增强了生成式检测范式的性能，在上下文依赖的细粒度检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架成功解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的迁移挑战，通过解耦和对齐策略实现了跨领域的有效视觉语言理解，为遥感图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Conclusion: 该方法证明了使用未预处理数据直接进行甲烷检测的可行性，提供了模型检查点和两个ML就绪数据集供社区使用。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets

Conclusion: MV-SSM通过创新的状态空间建模和扫描机制，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化能力，在多个基准测试中都超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

*Yifei She,Huangxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FtZ是一个新颖的多模态大语言模型视觉塔框架，通过组合语义强大的锚编码器和感知丰富的增强编码器，解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉任务上的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上表现不佳，主要原因是单一视觉编码器架构牺牲了细粒度视觉信息的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出FtZ框架，创新性地通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合，超越单一编码器设计。

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型。

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实世界基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从无标签真实数据学习的挑战，现有方法存在域差距或违反光度假设的问题

Method: 引入选择-调优-保持(STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化，并施加主方向正则化

Result: 在四种不同天气条件的真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣合成数据训练的方法甚至深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略通过有效平衡适应性和预训练知识保持，实现了恶劣天气条件下的泛化深度估计，为几何中心任务提供了有效的参数高效微调方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Motivation: 挖掘假评器模型的潜力，挑战传统上评估模型与生成模型分离的观念，尝试构建统一的多模态系统。

Method: 将偏好标注的假评器数据集重新组织为可验证的训练信号，并在基础生成模型上进行阳功学习训练。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1在26个视觉推理和理解测试中超过专门训练的VLM模型，平均提升5.7%；LLaVA-Critic-R1+在7B规模下达到MMMU 71.9的SOTA性能；自我评估在五个代表性推理任务上带来13.8%的提升。

Conclusion: 阳功学习训练假评器数据可以产生同时擅长评估和生成的统一模型，为可扩展的自我改进多模态系统提供简单途径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以建模长距离空间-光谱特征依赖关系，而Mamba虽能解决计算负担但无法直接进行特征融合

Method: 设计预处理模块适配Mamba结构，结合CNN提取多层特征；创新设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块进行双模态特征充分融合；构建结合Mamba和CNN优势的更强主干网络

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018数据集上实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，性能优于Transformer方法

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功实现了多模态特征的高效融合，在保持低计算负担的同时提升了遥感图像分类性能

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Conclusion: CascadeFormer证明了Transformer架构和掩码预训练在基于骨架的人体动作识别任务中的有效性，为相关研究提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个用于评估视觉-语言模型中投影层泛化能力的标准化测试框架，发现投影层在未见概念上仍能保持79-88%的性能，并通过机制解释揭示其工作原理类似于键值存储器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型中的投影层虽然重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力缺乏系统性评估。需要一个标准化的测试框架来量化投影层的泛化性能。

Method: 适配物体检测数据集为提示格式，设计训练/测试分割使其标签集互斥，以精确控制已见和未见概念的分离。通过机制解释方法分析投影层的工作机理。

Result: 实验结果显示投影层在各种设置下对未见类别保持了79-88%的性能（与已见类别相比），表明即使没有明确的对齐监督也具有非平凡的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一个新的对齐泛化评估框架，并证明了投影层通过键值存储器机制实现了良好的泛化。这为使用有限对齐数据进行高效VLM训练揭示了潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤病变分类中取得了显著进展，但存在肤色相关的潜在偏见问题，影响诊断结果的公平性。传统方法面临肤色分类困难、计算需求高和公平性验证复杂等挑战。

Method: 通过计算VGG网络卷积层和Vision Transformer中patches和heads的特征图偏度，识别并减少与肤色相关的不必要通道，专注于病变区域特征。

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法为皮肤病变分类提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在保持诊断准确性的同时确保跨不同肤色的公平性，更适合实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，为视觉SAE特征提供因果性解释，揭示特征激活的真正驱动因素而非仅仅共现模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于最高激活区域的特征解释方法存在误导性，因为自注意力机制会混合整个图像信息，激活区域往往只是与特征共现而非真正原因

Method: 提出Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)和输入归因技术，识别真正驱动SAE特征激活的图像块

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF图与原始激活图经常不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系；patch插入测试证实CaFE能更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法在复杂真实世界图像理解中表现出色。

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:

Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal

through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法有效解决了检测变换器中的有毒兄弟偏差问题，显著提升了人-物交互检测的精度和性能

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果、效率和安全性之间取得了良好平衡

Conclusion: 提出的Cancelable Product Quantization框架有效解决了安全人脸检索中的效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉假体研究在脑解码方面取得进展，但脑编码阶段生成的脑信号缺乏生物合理性验证，需要从真实脑响应中获取监督信号

Method: 使用预训练CLIP视觉编码器提取图像语义特征，结合交叉注意力增强的U-Net扩散模型，通过迭代去噪重建生物合理的脑信号

Result: 在THINGS-EEG2和THINGS-MEG多模态数据集上验证了框架有效性，可视化展示了M/EEG信号的个体内和个体间变异

Conclusion: 提出的交叉注意力增强扩散模型框架能够生成生物合理的脑信号，为视觉假体的脑编码阶段提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中关键的时间维度，限制了自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 1) 开发OmniReason-Data数据集，包含密集时空标注和自然语言解释；2) 设计OmniReason-Agent架构，集成稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，采用时空知识蒸馏方法。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中取得显著改进，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架为复杂动态环境中的可解释、时间感知自动驾驶系统建立了新的能力标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代检索和推理来提升知识密集型视觉问答的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问答任务上表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，利用累积的推理记录动态制定多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并通过迭代逐步完善理解

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等基准测试中显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一个可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Conclusion: 该模块通过内容自适应能力，用物理信息变换替代随机预处理，同时通过多视图融合提高对异质性图像的稳健性

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效的梯度基攻击方法，在对抗攻击和防御增强方面都具有优异表现

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态混合和噪声消除技术，有效提高了纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和稳健性，适用于复杂噪声环境

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

Motivation: 单目视频重建动态3D场景在AR/VR等领域有广泛应用，但相机和物体运动导致的严重运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，进而影响重建质量

Method: 将相机和物体运动建模为3D高斯的SE(3)仿射变换，提出三阶段训练策略：先固定位姿优化高斯，再固定高斯优化位姿，最后联合优化所有参数

Conclusion: 通过端到端联合优化相机位姿和3D高斯属性，有效解决了运动模糊导致的动态场景重建问题，取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse

Conclusion: 该方法通过场景外推和视角插值的分解策略，有效解决了单视图新视角合成的长期视角和场景一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Motivation: 当前QAT方法主要关注量化模型在分布内数据的性能，但忽视了分布外数据上的性能退化问题。研究发现QAT会导致尖锐的损失景观，这与平坦损失景观有利于OOD泛化的观点相矛盾。

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）引入层冻结机制缓解双优化目标间的梯度冲突；2）设计基于梯度无序度的自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）使用梯度无序度指标识别训练中的不稳定层。

Result: 在多个有影响力的OOD基准测试中，FQAT在分布内和分布外图像分类任务上都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FQAT通过平坦化损失景观有效解决了QAT在OOD数据上的泛化性能下降问题，为可泛化的量化感知训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为姿态基于特发性症筛查提供了数据集和新的模型框架，解决了数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题，提高了筛查的准确性和临床解释性。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级的token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活度并保留高分token，同时使用语义记忆库和两级排序机制来提升prompt tuning的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的prompt tuning虽然能实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关的特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本，需要一种既能提升准确性又能提高效率的方法。

Method: 提出Spotlighter框架：1）从样本和语义角度评估视觉token激活度，保留高分token；2）使用类别特定的语义记忆库学习原型来精化选择；3）引入两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升高达11.19%，额外获得0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是prompt tuning中一个有效且可扩展的基线方法，在准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光RAW视频中由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致的严重信号退化问题，满足视频帧率要求下的去噪需求

Method: 采用元数据条件化方案指导对齐和去噪过程，结合Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS)机制建模长程时间依赖性

Result: 在严谨真实的数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现，赢得了AIM 2025挑战赛第一名

Conclusion: DarkVRAI通过创新的条件化方案和BOSS机制，为低光视频去噪设立了新的标准

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的立体视觉Transformer模型，通过处理双视角X光图像序列，同时实现式管分割和3D力估计，超越了现有的独立分割和力估计方法。

Motivation: 现有多任务深度学习模型通过CNN编码器-解码器处理双视角X光图像，但需要逐渐扩大感受野。本文从新视角出发，提出使用Vision Transformer来捕捉长程依赖关系。

Method: 设计了一种新的编码器-解码器Vision Transformer模型，将两张X光图像作为独立序列处理。模型包含两个共享分割头部和一个回归头部，分割头部使用编码器和解码器的嵌入，回归头部使用解码器融合信息进行3D力估计。

Result: 模型在各种噪声水平的合成X光图像上进行了涉广实验，与最先进的纯分割模型、视觉基于式管力估计方法以及多任务式管分割和力估计方法进行了比较，在式管分割和力估计两个任务上都达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该立体Vision Transformer模型能够同时从两个角度分割式管并估计其头部产生的3D力，为式管插入手术提供了更优秀的触觉和视觉感知数据，在该领域创造了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Motivation: 现有视频令牌压缩方法采用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型将视频片段转换为软描述令牌作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例基于场景丰富度（描述长度）。

Result: 相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs，同时保持竞争性性能，定性结果显示能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC模仿人类动态表达视觉信息的方式，实现了高效且自适应的视频令牌压缩，为视频理解任务提供了更智能的压缩策略。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

Motivation: 解决在RGB数据上表现优异的3DGS方法在多谱数据上的问题，因为粳洋每个波段的优化会导致几何结构不一致

Method: 评估三种策略：单独每波段重建、分段优化（先RGB后其他波段）、聚合优化（可选先RGB阶段），并将多谱数据直接集成到球面豪元颜色组件中

Conclusion: 建议将多谱数据直接集成到3DGS的颜色组件，并提供了优化过程中引入谦波段的关键交易选择和实践见解

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法在明暗变化条件下显著提升了视觉地点识别的强健性，并通过维度分析确定了关键组件，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Method: 采用两步聚类方法：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类，结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线高度和方位分布等指标进行分析

Result: 雨天条件下驾驶员更频繁查看仪表盘、注视持续时间更长、视线高度更高，表明认知专注度增加，但整体注视行为（关注道路和偶尔检查后视镜）保持一致

Conclusion: 研究揭示了恶劣条件下视觉注意力模式的变化，强调了利用注视建模辅助设计更鲁棒的ADAS和DMS的潜力

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多个属性并利用条件先验，成功解决了基于滑块的文本到图像生成中多属性同时控制的挑战，具有较好的通用性和计算效率。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理现实世界中玻璃表面的多种污染物，通过测试时自适应机制显著提升了图像恢复性能，特别是在处理未知污染类型时具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Conclusion: LPFM作为首个统一的低级别病理学基础模型，能够有效处理多种图像增强任务，为病理学图像处理提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功地将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，在精度和效率方面都表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

TL;DR: VEPE是一个端到端的视频姿态估计框架，通过时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，解决了传统两阶段方法的效率低下和时空上下文分离问题，在Posetrack数据集上表现优异且推理效率提升300%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频姿态估计方法采用两阶段流程（检测+时序建模），存在时空维度分离、无法进行端到端优化、依赖复杂后处理（RoI裁剪、NMS）导致推理效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：时空姿态编码器(STPE)、时空可变形记忆编码器(STDME)、时空姿态解码器(STPD)。同时引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性，解决姿态查询匹配过程中的不匹配问题。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于大多数两阶段模型，并将推理效率提高了300%。

Conclusion: VEPE提供了一个简单灵活的端到端视频姿态估计解决方案，能够有效利用时序上下文优化人体姿态估计，同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Motivation: 现有点云压缩方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息，缺乏这两种信息之间的通信，导致重建质量受限。

Method: 提出点体素交错网络(PVINet)，包含体素编码器提取全局结构特征和点编码器建模局部上下文，引入条件稀疏卷积实现特征交互，解码时使用点嵌入指导重建。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，PVINet相比最先进方法具有竞争性性能。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理全局局部特征并实现有效交互，提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了FICGen方法，通过频率知识转移和上下文频率感知指导来解决退化场景下布局到图像生成的上下文幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在退化场景（低光照、水下等）中布局到图像生成存在的生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐性差的问题，主要归因于退化条件下的"上下文幻觉困境"。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解缠生成范式(FICGen)，包含可学习的双查询机制提取频率原型，视觉频率增强注意力注入频率知识，实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块来调节解缠和重建表示。

Result: 在5个基准测试中（从严重低光照到轻度模糊的各种退化场景），FICGen在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面 consistently 超越现有L2I方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过频率知识转移和上下文解缠机制有效解决了退化场景下的布局到图像生成问题，显著提升了生成质量和对齐性能。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种新颖的高斯参数化空间自适应标记化框架，使用2D高斯模型动态建模图像区域的位置、形状和纹理，实现非均匀图像标记化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同位置、形状和纹理的图像区域，限制了特征表示效果。

Method: 首先使用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的可变大小区域，然后将每个区域参数化为2D高斯（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征。使用专用transformer优化高斯参数，通过可微分渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务上，使用128个标记分别实现了0.65的rFID和1.50的FID分数，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，在图像表示和生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法忽视了标注数据中的噪声和不同像素的异质性价值，主要关注如何生成参考预测，而非有效挖掘预测中的丰富信息。

Method: 提出MetaSSL框架，使用空间异质性损失函数，根据不确定性和一致性信息为像素分配不同权重。将预测结果分为四个区域：UC、US、DC、DS，并采用适应性阈值区分自信预测。该方法可以插入现有半监督学习方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，MetaSSL在不同数据集上与现有半监督学习框架结合时，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了有效挖掘预测中的丰富信息比具体的参考预测生成策略更为重要，MetaSSL作为一个通用的插入式框架可以提升现有半监督学习方法的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Motivation: 现有的端到端MVPT方法仅依赖当前和相邻过去时间戳，忽略了更早的轨迹历史信息，限制了关联性能。

Method: 提出轨迹运动成本和轨迹外观成本，基于注意力机制捕获多时间戳间关系，即使在某些时间戳存在错误关联也能基于其他时间戳正确关联。

Result: 大量实验证明MVTrajecter各组件有效性，并在性能上超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 利用多时间戳轨迹信息能显著提升多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs通过视觉语言编码器选择关键帧来降低计算成本，但这些编码器是否能真正识别最具信息量的帧尚不明确，需要实证研究。

Method: 通过实证研究分析流行视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面的能力限制，揭示其在定位视频中相关信息区域的问题。

Result: 研究发现当前流行的视觉编码器在识别MLLMs应该关注的关键帧方面存在严重局限，无法有效处理给定的文本查询。

Conclusion: 为了构建高效视频MLLMs，需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术，当前视觉编码器的局限性表明这一领域需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的挑战，包括EEG空间分辨率低、神经记录与视频动态的时间不匹配、以及脑活动中语义信息利用不足等问题

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA水平，视频和帧级重建精度分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%

Conclusion: DynaMind在神经动力学与高保真视觉语义之间架起了关键桥梁，实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了现有预训练个性化生成模型的性能，在单主体和多主体个性化图像合成基准测试中达到最先进结果，有效缓解属性泄漏同时保持优异的主体保真度。

Conclusion: FocusDPO框架通过动态焦点分配和语义对应映射，推动了可控多主体图像合成的前沿发展，为多主体个性化图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案，显著提升了评估的精细度和跨域性能。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用整个形状集合的结构信息和双域一致性约束，显著提升了非刚性多形状匹配的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of
tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide
researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 双视图交叉重建相比单视图自重建能显著提高预训练难度，在3D自监督学习中取得了更好的性能表现

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale

design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过一体化的ODE-Fourier模块设计，有效解决了跨域少样本分割中知识流动问题，为跨域适应性提供了一种结构简洁但有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR在自动驾驶3D语义分割中至关重要，但昂贵传感器限制了大规模部署。低成本16通道LiDAR产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度。

Method: 采用端到端联合优化框架，SR模块融入语义线索并保留细节特征，提出新的SR损失函数关注感兴趣区域，使用轻量级模型架构减少参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在分割性能上达到与64通道高成本LiDAR数据相当的水平，同时参数量显著少于现有LiDAR SR方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了低成本LiDAR数据分割精度问题，为大规模自动驾驶部署提供了经济有效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间对齐分割与扩散建模；使用粗粒度先验预测器提供逐步指导；扩散网络学习相对于先验的残差；采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、Probabilistic U-Net和普通扩散基线，获得了更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少的采样步骤。

Conclusion: PGRD框架能够有效学习医学图像分割的体素级分布，在保持强校准性能的同时显著提高了采样效率，为概率性医学图像分割提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges: detecting small, dense, and
overlapping objects (a major hurdle in computer vision) and improving the
quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial
environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised
deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de-
veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances. By evaluating
their performance, accuracy, and com- putational efficiency, we identify the
most reliable detection systems and highlight the specific challenges they
address in industrial applications. This paper also examines the use of deep
learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We
introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的街道级图像地理定位方法，通过结合多模态大语言模型和检索增强生成技术，在不需细调的情况下实现了独特的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，传统计算机视觉技术在图像定位方面遇到挑战，需要更有效的解决方案来支持导航、位置基于推荐等重要应用。

Method: 方法使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集（EMP-16和OSV-5M）上构建向量数据库，通过检索增强生成技术为查询图像提供相似和不相似的地理位置信息提示，然后由多模态大语言模型处理。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的标准数据集（IM2GPS、IM2GPS3k和YFCC4k）上实现了最优性能，达到更高的准确率，而且无需细调或重新训练。

Conclusion: 这种基于检索增强生成的多模态大语言模型方法为地理定位预测提供了一条替代传统从头训练模型的新路径，为GeoAI领域开启了更易访问和可扩展解决方案的新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的实时决策解决方案，为资源受限环境中的轻量级多模态AI系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret是一个统一的医学图像检索模型，通过自监督学习在混合模态数据集上训练，无需模态特定定制，在零样本检索和跨模态对齐方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了可扩展性，阻碍了统一表示的发展。

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学影像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，使用生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式训练统一的视觉编码器M3Ret。

Result: 在所有单独模态的零样本图像检索中达到新的最先进水平，超越DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线；在没有配对数据的情况下实现强跨模态对齐；在未见过的MRI任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M3Ret为医学成像社区提供了有前景的信号，是迈向多模态医学图像理解视觉自监督基础模型的重要一步，证明了纯视觉自监督对未见模态的泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Motivation: 现有的身份保持文本到视频生成方法依赖对大型预训练视频扩散模型的微调，但面临数据稀缺和高调优成本的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：1）使用GPT-4o进行面部感知提示增强；2）基于提示的参考图像增强；3）身份感知时空引导增强，通过统一梯度优化生成过程。

Result: 在1000个视频测试集上通过自动和人工评估验证，方法优于先前工作，在ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛中获得第一名，展示了最先进的性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TPIGE框架通过训练免费的方式有效解决了身份保持文本到视频生成中的语义鸿沟问题，以最小成本实现了显著的性能提升，代码已开源。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Conclusion: Uirapuru框架成功解决了可转向摄像头实时视频分析的关键挑战，通过自适应分块和相机驱动理解的结合，在动态场景中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Motivation: 无人机在弱光条件下性能严重降级，现有弱光增强方法面临航拍图像的超高分辨率、缺乏配对数据、严重非均匀照明和部署限制等挑战。

Method: 构建U3D无监督UHR无人机数据集，提出Edge Efficiency Index (EEI)指标，开发U3LIE框架包含适应性前增强扩墜(APA)和亮度间隔损失(L_int)两个训练技术。

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: RAL框架通过概率建模和置信门控机制，有效解决部分相关视频检索中的查询歧义和视频部分相关性带来的数据不确定性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理部分相关视频检索时容易受到伪语义相关性的干扰，主要原因是查询歧义性和视频部分相关性导致的数据不确定性。

Method: 提出RAL框架：1）将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模；2）引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度；3）可作为即插即用方案集成到现有架构中。

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RAL框架通过显式建模数据不确定性，显著提升了部分相关视频检索的性能，能够更好地处理查询歧义和视频部分相关性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RibPull是一种利用隐式占据场连接计算几何和医学影像的方法，通过神经占据场表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取中轴，在稀疏数据处理和几何操作方面优于传统体素方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素网格在医学影像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，需要更有效的连续表示方法来处理稀疏噪声数据并保持复杂几何信息。

Method: 使用神经占据场（预测3D点是否在物体内部）来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用基于拉普拉斯的收缩方法来提取胸腔的中轴，利用连续坐标基础的3D场景表示。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，该方法在稀疏信号补偿和几何操作方面相比体素基础表示有显著优势。

Conclusion: 隐式占据场为医学影像中的稀疏数据处理和复杂几何操作提供了更好的解决方案，连续坐标基础的表示方法在形态学操作方面具有明显优势。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，但忽视了风格一致性的重要性，这影响了图像的整体美感和连贯性。

Method: 提出神经场景设计器(NSD)框架，采用并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息，并设计渐进式自风格表示学习(PSRL)模块，通过风格对比损失学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功实现了在图像编辑中同时保持语义对齐和风格一致性的目标，为解决风格一致性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统图像质量评估方法需要大规模人工标注数据的问题，开发一个既准确又高效的感知度量标准，同时能够在生成任务中作为优化工具

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过可复现的失真和多种质量度量集成来评分，结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略，在VAE编码器的潜在表示中进行感知对齐优化

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中超越现有度量方法，推理速度快，在去噪、超分辨率和人脸修复等任务中显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销

Conclusion: MILO不仅是最先进的图像质量度量标准，还是生成管道中感知优化的实用工具，实现了准确性和效率的平衡

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent

Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.

memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice是一种新的点云处理方法，通过将3D点云水平切片为多组2D数据，结合切片交互网络(SIN)保持垂直关系，在保持高精度的同时显著提升推理速度和减少参数数量。


<details>

Motivation: 解决体素方法精度高但推理慢、柱状方法速度快但精度不足的问题，寻求在自动驾驶3D目标检测中实现精度与速度的平衡。

Method: 提出PointSlice方法：1) 将3D点云水平切片为多组2D数据，模型仅学习2D分布；2) 引入切片交互网络(SIN)保持切片间垂直关系，增强3D感知能力。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上比SAFDNet快1.13倍，参数减少0.79倍，精度仅降低1.2 mAPH；在nuScenes上达到66.74 mAP的SOTA结果；在Argoverse 2上快1.10倍，参数减少0.66倍，精度降低1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice在多个数据集上实现了精度与速度的良好平衡，为3D点云目标检测提供了一种高效的新方法。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的3D形状生成建立了一个实用框架，实现了高几何保真度的快速生成。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Conclusion: 自适应卷积模块有效提升了模型的沿午能力，MSA2-Net在多个医学图像分割数据集上表现优异，为医学图像分割领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Motivation: HIFU治疗的成功和安全性依赖于实时监测，但超声引导HIFU治疗时存在干扰问题，影响监测效果。

Result: 在体外实验中，HIFU-ILDiff的SSIM达到0.796，PSNR为23.780，显著优于陷波滤波器的0.443和14.420；处理速度达到15帧/秒，远快于陷波滤波器的5秒/帧。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，提高HIFU治疗的精确度，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5通过三项关键创新有效解决了视频理解的基本挑战，为多模态大语言模型在视频处理领域的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Result: 前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，显著降低了模型复杂度；在相机追踪和密集3D重建质量方面都实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效且通用的视觉SLAM解决方案，无需相机内参知识，在保持轻量级设计的同时实现了卓越的性能表现。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit是一个统一的视频编辑框架，通过创新的对象失真控制信号和复制形式保护模块，实现了高效、高保真的多样化视频编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中面临挑战，需要为不同编辑任务设计不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源。

Method: 提出O-DisCo-Edit框架，包含基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号，以及用于保护未编辑区域的"复制形式"保护模块。

Result: 大量实验和综合人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中超越了专业化和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够灵活封装多种编辑线索，实现高效、高质量的多样化视频编辑。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

*Jefferson Hernandez,Jing Shi,Simon Jenni,Vicente Ordonez,Kushal Kafle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过模拟同行评审机制，让多个LVLM模型进行迭代自我改进，免除了人工标注或机器生成偏好数据的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统对齐方法依赖人工精选偏好数据成本高、机器生成数据质量不好、自监督数据容易产生幻觉等问题

Method: 提出Panel-of-Peers学习框架，通过多个LVLM模型组成评审委员会，进行连续的输出生成、评估和精炼过程，模拟同行评审和教室学习环境

Result: 在十五个标准测试集上平均分数从48%提升到57%，显著改善模型性能，且无需大量人工标签数据

Conclusion: 同行评估可作为一种可扩展的自监督对齐替代方案，Panel-of-Peers框架有效提升了LVLM模型的性能而不依赖于人工数据

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，few-step模型虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩主干网络，现有后训练量化方法需要全精度校准，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散调度器调整few-step采样轨迹；设计JAQ损失函数结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标，实现无参考的量化感知预调节系数学习。

Result: 相比FP16 4-step LCM提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8-step PCM提升16.6% FID；大规模用户研究（80,000+标注）证实了在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成中具有互补性，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型部署提供了新途径，避免了全精度推理校准需求。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVision 2简化了原版架构，移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升OpenVision的训练效率，减少训练时间和内存消耗，同时保持多模态性能竞争力。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练，简化模型架构。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批次大小从2k增至8k，参数量可扩展至10亿以上，性能与原版相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级的纯生成式训练范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器的发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Conclusion: ReVPT通过强化学习有效提升了多模态LLMs的视觉工具使用能力，为基于RL的视觉工具使用提供了新的见解

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and

Method: 使用ResNet50和DINOv2架构，在分类器前加入可选的三维PCA降维步骤，构建三层分类器进行多标签分类

Result: PCA的有效性强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略，不同架构对PCA的响应不同

Conclusion: 研究为自监督预训练和替代降维方法的未来研究开辟了道路，PCA在多标签多光谱分类中的应用需要根据具体架构进行优化

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 岩石粒度精确分类对岩土工程、采矿和资源管理至关重要，影响运营效率和安全，需要更准确的分类方法

Method: 在ConvNeXt基础上引入自注意力机制捕捉长距离空间依赖，加入通道注意力机制强调信息丰富的特征通道，形成混合设计

Result: 在岩石粒度分类数据集上评估，相比三个强基线模型，注意力机制的加入显著提升了细粒度分类能力

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

TL;DR: 提出基于临床元数据的双阶段扩散框架，用于解决有限角度CT重建的严重伪影问题，通过元数据引导生成先验并整合物理约束，显著提升重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT虽然能提高时间分辨率和降低辐射剂量，但由于投影截断导致严重伪影，需要解决这一不适定重建问题

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于transformer的扩散模型，仅依赖元数据（采集参数、患者人口统计、诊断印象）从噪声生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据生成高保真结果，每个采样步骤都使用ADMM模块强制执行基于物理的数据一致性

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，加入元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下。相比无元数据基线，在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上表现更优

Conclusion: 不同类型的元数据提供互补优势，特别是诊断和人口统计先验在有限角度条件下效果显著。临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect

TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中token交互相似的洞察，训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，然后使用分类器引导将目标光照融入图像生成过程。

Result: 在多种场景类型上实现了最先进的性能，在质量和控制方面表现出色，相比领先工作具有更好的参数和数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘基础模型的知识可以切实可行地控制图像光照，实现实用且通用的重光照功能，为图像光照控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Motivation: 现有基于单细胞RNA测序参考的方法存在数据丢失、对齐质量依赖、批次效应等问题，需要开发不依赖外部数据的解决方案。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，利用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富的生物学意义基因潜在空间，采用扩散模型完成基因表达。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构显著优于其孤立组件，证明了利用上下文基因构建潜在空间的有效性，为空间转录组学数据分析提供了强大的无参考解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture

Conclusion: 首次将可解释性引入地理定位领域，通过概念对齐提升了模型性能和可解释性

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

*Elad Aharoni,Noy Porat,Dani Lischinski,Ariel Shamir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图并引入熵和距离控制参数，来改善文本到图像扩散模型对用户指定调色板的适配性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板在创意工作流中广泛使用，但用于图像生成时存在显著的模糊性和不稳定性，需要一种能够灵活控制调色板遵循度和颜色变化的方法。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个标量控制参数，采用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调，并在平衡覆盖稀有和常见颜色的数据集上进行训练。

Result: 方法在定性、定量和用户研究中均表现优异，在实现强调色板遵循度和高图像质量方面始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter能够实现稳定、语义一致的图像生成，在广泛的调色板和提示范围内都表现出色，为调色板条件化图像生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于视觉的非侵入式自动化监测系统，使用量化的MobileNet模型在Raspberry Pi上实现实时新生儿行为状态检测，为资源稀缺环境提供可扩展、低成本的NICU监测解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产儿死亡率高，特别是在资源稀缺地区，但现有的手动观察或侵入式传感器监测方式存在错误多、不实用和可能造成皮肤损伤等问题。

Method: 设计了一种嵌入式监测系统，采用量化的MobileNet模型部署在Raspberry Pi上，通过视觉监测实现新生儿行为状态检测。系统集成了模型量化、Raspberry Pi优化视觉管道和安全IoT通信等关键技术。

Result: 系统在公开新生儿图像数据集上达到了状态之最准确率（睡眠检测91.8%，哭叹/正常分类97.7%），同时保持了适合边缘部署的计算效率。模型量化带来了68%的存储空间减少。

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型（如MobileNet）是建立可扩展、低成本且临床可行的NICU监测系统的最佳基础，为改善资源稀缺环境中的早产儿护理探索了新路径。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言引导的多目标跟踪方面取得进展，但其安全性和鲁棒性研究不足，需要从设计逻辑角度分析对抗性漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗框架，通过精心设计的数字和物理扰动攻击RMOT系统的语言-视觉引用和跟踪对象匹配组件，特别是针对使用FIFO内存的高级模型的空间-时间推理漏洞。

Result: 在Refer-KITTI数据集上的评估表明，VEIL能有效破坏跟踪逻辑可靠性，导致跟踪ID切换和终止，证明了RMOT系统存在严重安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RMOT系统在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，强调了在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知的RMOT设计。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Motivation: 现有对比自监督学习方法依赖大量真实数据和精心策划的困难负样本，研究旨在探索使用合成数据作为替代方案的可能性。

Method: 提出Syn2Co框架，结合两种"伪造"方式：1)使用生成模型产生合成数据增强样本多样性；2)在表示空间生成合成困难负样本创建多样化对比。在DeiT-S和Swin-T架构上进行评估。

Result: 研究揭示了合成数据在自监督学习中的潜力和局限性，为未来工作提供了见解。

Conclusion: 合成增强训练可以产生更鲁棒和可迁移的视觉表示，但合成数据的使用仍存在一定局限性，需要进一步探索。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

Motivation: 解决现有slot attention方法缺乏高级语义信息以及无法微调编码器的两大限制

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段利用前景/背景语义信息，和Bootstrap分支通过自助策略训练特征适应机制

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上显著提升了多个SOTA slot attention模型的性能

Conclusion: 方法能够有效解决现有限制，提升了对象中心学习的语义理解和灵活性

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

TL;DR: SALAD是一种语义感知的判别式逻辑异常检测方法，通过显式建模对象组成图的分布来改善逻辑异常检测性能，在MVTec LOCO基准上达到96.1%的AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合的预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新提出的组成分支来显式建模对象组成图的分布，学习重要的语义关系。还引入了无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组成图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上显著优于最先进方法，达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组成图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法的重要性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Method: 采用统一的图神经网络框架处理非重叠子片段，引入新颖的自回归长期跟踪(ALT)层进行融合，子片段大小控制延迟和时间上下文之间的权衡

Result: 在DanceTrack上在线AssA提升+2.3，SportsMOT提升+9.2，MOT20提升+5.0，离线模式下增益更大

Conclusion: NOOUGAT打破了在线和离线跟踪的传统界限，为多目标跟踪提供了灵活的时间处理能力，在各种部署场景下都表现出色

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the

Conclusion: 空间关系理解是当前VLM的重要瓶颈，需要专门改进。数据集以CC-BY-4.0许可证发布，评估代码开源。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address
the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and
spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid
Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration
by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction
and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network
(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过双流图卷积网络有效提升了模型对密度变化的适应能力和多视角多姿态场景下的计数精度

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Result: 在多个远程感知测试集上持续超过现有方法，能够以最小标签数据高效适配

Conclusion: 空间-语义整合在远程感知OOD检测中具有重要价值，RS-OOD框架为自主监测和灾害响应提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在空间关系推理方面表现不佳，特别是在处理不常见的物体组合时。现有方法通过模型微调或手工设计的损失函数进行优化，但这些方法不够理想。

Method: 提出Learn-to-Steer框架：1）训练轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系；2）在推理时将该分类器作为学习到的损失函数；3）使用双重反转策略避免分类器走捷径，确保真正的几何理解。

Result: 方法显著提升了空间准确性：在FLUX.1-dev上从0.20提升到0.61，在SD2.1上从0.07提升到0.54。同时能够泛化到多种关系并显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过直接从模型内部表示学习空间关系目标，而不是依赖手工设计的损失函数，可以更有效地解决文本到图像模型的空间推理问题，该方法具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出ORDAC方法，通过标签分布学习动态调整序数分类中的噪声标签，在年龄估计和疾病严重程度检测任务上显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声标签，这会显著降低机器学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，纠正而非丢弃噪声样本

Result: 在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正中也表现有效

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是增强序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Conclusion: C33D方法通过系统化的多步流程，有效解决了3D对象合成中的纹理不一致和形状不准确问题，能够生成结构协调的新颖3D模型

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对多模态大语言模型空间理解能力的全面系统评估，往往局限于单视图或视频等孤立场景，需要从数据和架构角度进行深入分析。

Method: 提出了MulSeT基准测试，涵盖单视图、多视图和视频三种代表性场景，设计了一系列实验来分析MLLMs的空间推理能力，从数据和架构两个角度进行系统评估。

Result: 从数据角度看，空间理解性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限较低；从架构角度看，空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器的位置编码而非语言模型的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习驱动的协作蒸馏和自学习机制，成功实现了轻量级模型的高质量红外与可见光图像融合，为多模态图像融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 高保真实时虚拟化妆试艺框架，通过透明化妆提取和渲染分离实现身份保持和时间一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有化妆转移方法在身份保持、时间一致性和实时性方面的不足，特别是透明化妆与皮肤颜色的集成问题

Method: 将化妆转移解耦为两步：透明化妆面具提取和图形学渲染，使用图形渲染管线和k-means聚类生成伪真实数据进行训练，采用alpha重构和唇彩损失优化透明度估计

Result: 方法在多样化姿势、表情和皮色情况下都能实现稳健的化妆转移，保持时间平滑性，在细节捕捉、时间稳定性和身份保持方面超过现有基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的两步解耦方法和专门的训练目标，成功解决了实时虚拟化妆试艺中的关键技术挑战，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Motivation: 监测河流和地表水在精细空间和时间尺度上仍具挑战性，特别是狭窄或富含沉积物的河流难以被低分辨率卫星数据捕捉。

Method: 通过计算机科学与水文学专家合作开发RiverScope数据集，包含1145张高分辨率图像和专家标注的水体掩膜，与Sentinel-2、SWOT和SWORD数据库配准，评估多种深度学习架构和预训练策略。

Result: 建立了首个全球高分辨率河流宽度估算基准，中位误差7.2米；最佳模型结合迁移学习和多光谱通道学习适配器，显著优于现有卫星方法。

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Motivation: 传统视频合成流程需要大量人工和专业协作，制作周期长、成本高。希望通过生成模型自动化这一过程，实现用户可定制化的视频合成。

Method: 基于Diffusion Transformer设计新pipeline：轻量级背景保护分支保持编辑一致性；DiT融合块继承动态元素；扩展旋转位置编码(ERoPE)处理不同布局；构建61K视频数据集VideoComp。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效实现生成式视频合成，在保真度和一致性方面优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的生成式视频合成方法能够自动化传统视频合成流程，为用户提供交互式定制能力，在视频编辑质量上表现优异。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了各向异性傀里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，一种适用于医学形态异向性图像的位置编码方法，在多种医学形态分析任务中显著超过现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正弦位置编码(SPE)在高维空间中无法保持欧几里得距离，而同谨性傀里叶特征位置编码(IFPE)又无法处理图像的各向异性问题，特别是在医学形态分析中。

Method: 提出AFPE方法，通过给合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖关系，对IFPE进行了普遍化。在胸部X光片多标签分类、CT图像器官分类和心辅图弹出分数回归任务中进行系统性测试。

Result: 结果显示选择正确的位置编码可显著提升模型性能，最佳PE取决于目标结构的形状和数据的各向异性程度。AFPE在所有测试的各向异性场景中都显著超过了现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 在各向异性的医学形态图像和视频中，选择适合数据特征和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、支持实时处理的轻量级解决方案，适用于健身活动识别，并在视觉基于健康监测领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Motivation: 现有MRI图像分割方法主要采用集中式多模态范式，不适用于工程中非集中式的混合模态医疗场景。分布式医院处理多种混合MRI模态，每个客户端的模态集合和图像数据都不同，存在严重的客户端模态异质性和数据异质性。

Method: 提出了模态解耦和记忆混合模态联邦学习框架(MDM-MixMFL)，包含模态解耦策略和模态记忆机制。模态解耦策略将每个模态分解为模态特定信息和模态共享信息，在联邦更新时分别进行特定和共享更新。模态记忆机制动态存储客户端共享模态原型，补偿本地客户端的不完整模态。

Result: 在两个公共MRI图像分割数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够促进异构数据和模态的稳定自适应联邦聚合，有利于混合模态联邦学习过程中的模态聚合和融合。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Motivation: 现有方法虽然利用对象中心学习和运动线索，但仍需要监督生成伪标签来训练模型，存在监督依赖的局限性

Method: 扩展自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR，通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割生成伪标签，训练槽位去激活模块区分前景和背景

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上取得了强大的多目标发现结果，性能优于之前的先进方法

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR证明了概念简单但完全无监督的方法在多目标发现任务中的有效性，无需任何人工监督即可实现卓越性能

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: token合并作为可扩展3D视觉系统的原则性解决方案具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Conclusion: IOG框架能够实现早期火灾风险检测，并根据不断变化的风险情况为任务模块和机器人组件配置提供可解释的应急响应

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft
manipulators.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Motivation: 自动车辆定位(AVL)数据暴露了更新频率不一致的问题，需要有效的轨迹重建方法来提高转运动态分析的准确性。

Method: 研究使用得克萨斯州高分辨率AVL数据，评估13种轨迹重建方法，分析速度、位置、平滑和数据密度四个关键因素的作用。评估框架结合了位置和速度错误指标以及物理现实性考虑。

Result: 速度监督方法在性能上一贵超过仅依靠位置的方法。平滑方法在复杂城市环境中可能降低性能，但单调性依然关键。VCHIP-ME方法表现最佳，具有高准确性和计算效率的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为轨迹重建系统的实施提供了实用指南，强调了抓取高频率AVL数据的重要性。VCHIP-ME方法适合历史分析和实时应用，特别是与密集数据集结合时具有显著预测能力。

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

Motivation: 在动态机器人任务中，机器人需要识别物体的相关物理属性才能成功执行任务，但无法从失败中恢复或重试，需要人类干预。

Method: 基于强化学习的任务驱动探索方法，使用特权任务策略对属性估计误差的敏感性自动生成奖励来训练探索策略，并引入基于不确定性的机制决定何时从探索过渡到任务执行。

Result: 在击球任务中达到90%成功率，平均探索时间低于1.2秒，显著优于基线方法（最多40%成功率）。任务驱动奖励能够捕捉物理属性的相对重要性，并在KUKA iiwa机械臂上验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效识别物体物理属性并调整任务执行，在动态机器人任务中表现出色，为机器人自主适应未知环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

Conclusion: 混合设计既能在模拟器梯度不可用时实现高效一阶策略优化，又能避免其他一阶模型基回收强学习方法的不良行为

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

Motivation: 机器人经常遇到视觉模糊的对象，操作结果在物理交互前存在不确定性。虽然生成模型理论上可以适应这种模糊性，但实际上在模糊情况下表现屏弊。

Method: 显式将动作生成与验证解耦：使用无条件涵渊模型生成多个候选动作，然后通过历史感知验证器根据过往交互选择最有前景的动作。

Conclusion: HAVE方法通过结合历史信息的验证器，有效地解决了机器人遇到的视觉模糊问题，在各种复杂环境中都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

Conclusion: TReF-6能够从单次演示中提取任务空间结构，实现功能一致的技能泛化

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG具有三个优势特性：对不确定性的稳健性、可人工验证的可控自主性、以及通过AND/OR图备选路径实现的有界灵活性

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

Motivation: 架空架内镜在动态胃部环境中导航面临极大挑战，需要学会利用与可变形胃壁的接触来达到目标位置。传统方法在这种复杂环境中表现不佳。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）策略，利用接触力反馈开发接触辅助导航（CAN）策略。通过物理基于有限元法（FEM）模拟构建可变形胃部训练环境，使用PPO算法进行训练。

Result: 在静态和动态胃部环境中达到100%成功率（平均误差1.6mm），在具有更强外部干扰的未见场景中仍保持85%成功率，显著超过基线方法。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习基于接触辅助的导航策略能够实现高精度的架空架内镜导航，在复杂的动态医学环境中也保持良好的稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

Conclusion: 证明了体现VLA模型的可解释组件可以系统性地用于控制，为机器人领域的透明可控基础模型建立了新范式

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

TL;DR: JEDP-RL框架通过分阶段雅可比矩阵估计和策略执行，解决了可变形连续体机器人的规划挑战，相比PPO基线在收敛速度、导航效率和泛化能力方面均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形连续体机器人(DCRs)由于非线性变形力学和部分状态可观测性，违反了传统强化学习的马尔可夫假设，而基于雅可比的方法在DCRs上的直接应用受到时变运动学和欠驱动变形动力学的限制。

Method: 提出JEDP-RL框架，将规划分解为分阶段的雅可比估计和策略执行：在每个训练步骤中，先执行小规模局部探索动作来估计变形雅可比矩阵，然后用雅可比特征增强状态表示以恢复近似马尔可夫性。

Result: 在SOFA手术动态仿真中，JEDP-RL相比PPO基线表现出：1)收敛速度提高3.2倍；2)导航效率提高25%（到达目标所需步骤减少25%）；3)泛化能力：在材料属性变化下达到92%成功率，在未见组织环境中达到83%成功率（比PPO高33%）。

Conclusion: JEDP-RL框架通过将雅可比估计与强化学习相结合，有效解决了DCRs的规划挑战，在收敛速度、效率和泛化能力方面均优于传统方法，为可变形机器人的控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

Abstract: Traditional aggregate sorting methods, whether manual or mechanical, often
suffer from low precision, limited flexibility, and poor adaptability to
diverse material properties such as size, shape, and lithology. To address
these limitations, this study presents a computer vision-aided robotic arm
system designed for autonomous aggregate sorting in construction and mining
applications. The system integrates a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, a
binocular stereo camera for 3D perception, and a ROS-based control framework.
Core techniques include an attention-augmented YOLOv8 model for aggregate
detection, stereo matching for 3D localization, Denavit-Hartenberg kinematic
modeling for arm motion control, minimum enclosing rectangle analysis for size
estimation, and hand-eye calibration for precise coordinate alignment.
Experimental validation with four aggregate types achieved an average grasping
and sorting success rate of 97.5%, with comparable classification accuracy.
Remaining challenges include the reliable handling of small aggregates and
texture-based misclassification. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates
significant potential to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and
improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for
advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.

Conclusion: GVF-TAPE为智能机器人系统提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，通过视觉预测和位姿估计的结合实现了通用机器人操作

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can
generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable
performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines
generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable
scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to
predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task
description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose
estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames,
translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop,
GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of
tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and
generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for
intelligent robotic systems.

Abstract: This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the
challenge of creating robots that can perceive and act in the real world based
on natural language instructions. To bridge the gap between Large Language
Models (LLMs) and physical embodiment, we present contributions on two fronts:
scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust,
scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with
contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field
generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance
the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a
method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve
long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can
robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex,
language-based commands.

Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to
compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces.
Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the
utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion
would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A
challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial
arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes
a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into
follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace.
Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study
demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower
mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth
replicated movement.

types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000
TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts
per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides
comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw

Abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and
reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning.
Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points,
whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory.
Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and

Abstract: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving
the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert
pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual
sampling through tissue biopsy is prone to inaccuracies; 2) The extraction
process is followed by a time-consuming pathology test. To address these
limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion
platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our
platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes,
including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational
spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector
to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for
multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our
device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control
scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of
tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool
insertion efficacy.

semantic concepts from ConceptNet, (ii) a User Request Processing (URP) module
that disambiguates and structures instructions, and (iii) a Planner that
generates context-aware, feasible pick-and-place policies. In comparative
evaluations against Google SayCan, ConceptBot achieved 100% success on explicit

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算力矩方法(CTM)受系统参数不准确影响，而深度强化学习(DRL)存在样本效率低和稳定性保证弱的问题，需要结合两者优势

Method: 使用TD3算法优化计算力矩控制器参数，约束参数在物理合理范围内，并强制临界阻尼闭环时间响应

Result: 在MuJoCo物理引擎中模拟差速移动机器人，性能优于原始CTC和传统运动学控制器

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量学习回合即可找到任意奖励函数的最优控制器参数集，实现了样本效率和稳定性的平衡

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

Conclusion: LfD为电影领域提供了无需奖励函数的鲁棒替代方案，实现了实时部署和最小技术努力，使创意专业人员能够获得直观、风格化的相机控制

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of
robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments.
All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and
evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our

together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work
bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning
approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications.

Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field
to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of
current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which
largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of

absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU
safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving,
particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz
(WoZ) controlled robots to explore navigation, conversational dynamics,
human-in-the-loop interactions, and more to explore appropriate robot behaviors
in everyday settings. However, existing WoZ tools are often limited to one
context, making them less adaptable across different settings, users, and
robotic platforms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Context-Adaptable
Robot Interface System (CARIS) that combines advanced robotic capabilities such
teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data
recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ
control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour
guide. Furthermore, we identified areas of improvement for CARIS, including
smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality
separation, recommended prompts, and one-click communication options to enhance
the usability wizard control of CARIS. This project offers a publicly
available, context-adaptable tool for the HRI community, enabling researchers

Abstract: Visual SLAM algorithms have been enhanced through the exploration of Gaussian
Splatting representations, particularly in generating high-fidelity dense maps.
While existing methods perform reliably in static environments, they often
encounter camera tracking drift and fuzzy mapping when dealing with the
disturbances caused by moving objects. This paper presents DyPho-SLAM, a
real-time, resource-efficient visual SLAM system designed to address the
challenges of localization and photorealistic mapping in environments with
dynamic objects. Specifically, the proposed system integrates prior image
information to generate refined masks, effectively minimizing noise from mask
misjudgment. Additionally, to enhance constraints for optimization after
removing dynamic obstacles, we devise adaptive feature extraction strategies
significantly improving the system's resilience. Experiments conducted on
publicly dynamic RGB-D datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and dense map
reconstruction, while operating in real-time in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is shown by experiments.

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a
6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the
motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we
are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector
should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse
kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by
reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying
Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by
experiments.

Method: 将CDF与MPPI相结合，利用CDF的梯度信息统一MPPI在关节空间的成本函数，并将预测路径视野缩短到单步，大幅减少计算量

Conclusion: CDF-MPPI框架通过结合CDF的可靠梯度信息和MPPI的无梯度优化优势，在高维运动规划中实现了高效率和高性能的平衡，为机械手碰撞避免提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

Abstract: This paper presents an MFG-based decision-making framework for autonomous
driving in heterogeneous traffic. To capture diverse human behaviors, we
propose a quantitative driving style representation that maps abstract traits
to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These
parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model.
To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical
lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins,
time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM
data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental
results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two
15-vehicle scenarios, and NGSIM-based trials, consistently outperforming
conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a
scalable, interpretable, and behavior-aware planning framework for real-world
autonomous driving applications.

particularly valuable for robotics applications such as inverse kinematics

Conclusion: 层次化任务-5173节空间控制框架有效解决了高自由度系统的实时反应急放挑战

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

Result: 数值模拟结果显示，FPE-MPC控制方法能够有效管理软体机器人系统中内在的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种基于随机过程理论的控制策略，为软体机器人的不确定性控制问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy
in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements
are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the
quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system
performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across
diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited
adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement
precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.

Conclusion: PRBM+LDM是一种计算高效、准确的软体扭矩器建模技术，能够实现稳定灵活的摘取和精确的力调节。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene.
Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both
fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition,
OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic
annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization

Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有元学习方法依赖隐式适应任务变化，多个因素混合在单一维纵表示中，影响了模型的可解释性和演化性能。

Method: 设计了解耦多上下文元学习框架，将每个任务因素分配到独立上下文向量，支持上下文向量在共享因素的任务间共享。

Result: 在正弦回归任务中在分布外任务上超过基线，通过共享频率或相位移上下文向量实现了对未见正弦函数的演化。在四足机器人快步任务中，通过解耦机器人特性和地形特征，在分布外条件下获得更好稳健性，并仅用20秒平坦地形实际数据实现了到具有分布外机器人特性的挑战性地形的模拟到实际转移。

Conclusion: 解耦多上下文元学习框架通过明确分配任务因素到独立上下文向量，显著提升了模型的可解释性、演化性能和稳健性，并在模拟到实际转移中表现出艰难任务上的优势。

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language
models (LLMs), but still faces challenges in memory management, especially in
long-horizon tasks and dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose TopoNav, a
new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By
building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections,
adjacency, and semantic meaning, TopoNav helps agents accumulate spatial
knowledge over time, retrieve key information, and reason effectively toward
distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more
efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as
it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.

Abstract: As robot technology advances, collaboration between humans and robots will
become more prevalent in industrial tasks. When humans run into issues in such
scenarios, a likely future involves relying on artificial agents or robots for
aid. This study identifies key aspects for the design of future user-assisting
agents. We analyze quantitative and qualitative data from a user study
examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving
assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future
non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or
unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design
decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can
have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans
engaged in HRC tasks.

Motivation: 传统SLAM方法难以满足高质量场景重建需求，而现有高斯SLAM系统缺乏有效的姿态优化方法且在几何重建方面面临挑战，需要开发更先进的SLAM系统。

Method: 采用不透明度辐射场作为场景表示，进行全局调整优化相机姿态和稀疏点云，引入深度失真和法线一致性项来精化场景表示，并通过构建四面体网格直接从3D高斯中提取表面。

Result: 在多个真实世界和大规模合成数据集上的实验表明，该方法在跟踪精度和建图性能方面达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: FGO-SLAM通过创新的场景表示和优化方法，成功解决了高斯SLAM系统中的关键问题，为具身AI提供了高质量的感知能力和仿真测试数据。

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种为现有深度学习6D位姿预测器添加认知不确定性推理的方法，通过添加两个多层感知器来估计测量不确定性，并与扩展卡尔曼滤波器结合，提高物体相对状态估计性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在机器人感知中广泛应用，但深度神经网络测量的不确定性估计对于概率状态估计器至关重要，需要准确知道测量不确定性来指导机器人任务

Method: 在现有的DL位姿预测器基础上，分离添加两个多层感知器来分别估计平移和旋转部分的不确定性，冻结预训练预测器进行高效训练，将推断的6D位姿和不确定性作为EKF的测量和噪声协方差矩阵

Conclusion: 通过简单扩展现有DL预测器来实现认知不确定性推理，能够动态推断测量不确定性，提高状态估计任务的性能，适用于资源受限的边缘设备部署

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Conclusion: 该混合输入DRL算法通过结合轨迹预测和多模态信息，有效提高了自主驾驶车载变道决策的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an
exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+
populations. It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about
what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

Conclusion: IWR方法通过概率比估计有效解决了传统检索方法的问题，在少量样本模仿学习中表现出更好的性能，为小规模数据集上的机器人学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results
on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,
respectively, without requiring additional training data.

Motivation: 现有的关节估计方法主要在受控环境下工作，假设固定相机视角或直接观测不同物体状态，在真实无约束环境中容易失败。而人类通过观察他人操作物体就能轻松推断关节结构，这启发了本研究的思路。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪与因子图优化框架，直接从原始RGB-D视频中估计关节部件轨迹和关节轴。同时提出了首个自我中心视角的野外数据集Arti4D，包含场景级关节物体交互数据。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint为在动态相机运动和部分观测条件下估计关节物体模型提供了有效解决方案，Arti4D数据集的发布将推动该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Result: 在先进的导航基础模型上进行了全面评估，表明解码时干预不仅能过滤不安全动作，还能用于条件动作生成

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人基础模型提供了可证明的安全保障，同时保持了模型的泛化能力，是提升机器人系统安全性的有效方案

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法无需调整超参数，易于集成到标准RL流程中，为能源效率控制提供了一种理论基础坚实的替代方案

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary
surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is
studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of
performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging
Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission
complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and
efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission
objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study
presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration,
integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a
scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical
scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key
capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework
which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo
simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its
robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system
feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior
execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is
middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and
extending beyond aerial robotics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate
covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential
stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a
fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a
subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels),
which is also simulated for illustration.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了LiDAR轨迹汇算在恶劣天气下的适用性，为自动驾驶系统在更广泛环境条件下的可靠运行提供了支撑。

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

Conclusion: ATE提供了一个通用且轻量级的解决方案，显著增强了VLA模型在新机器人平台和任务中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何方法提供了一种通用、稳健且高效的基础惯性参数分析方法，在复杂机器人系统中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the
risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration
capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as
a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and
accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance
signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based
hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate
classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing
methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate
3D radar perception.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a
real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language
instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating
strong generalization in practical scenarios. Project page:

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the
available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset,
highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions. Our code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and
cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve
locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive
technologies focus on basic navigation or obstacle avoidance, few systems
provide scalable and efficient multi-object search capabilities in real-world,
partially observable settings. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGuide, an
assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success
rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a
foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living
environments.

Conclusion: Coral通过实现实用的可组合性，为广泛的机器人系统集成挑战提供了可扩展的解决方案，并已开源发布

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of
increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion
mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,
Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system
integration challenges, improving component reusability, system
reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We
release Coral open source.

Conclusion: 该分类方法有助于理解不同视觉触觉传感器的工作原理和性能特点，揭示了当前技术面临的挑战，并为未来研究提供了方向指导。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该研究为利用模拟数据和3D信息构建通用机器人策略开启了新方向，证明了通过深度摄像头提升机器人操作能力的可行性，希望能激发更多关于3D信息在机器人控制中应用的研究。

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在急诊精神病患者识别方面具有潜在应用价值，特别是在救援场景中

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data

Conclusion: ZeroQAT成功解决了传统量化方法在精度和效率之间的权衡问题，为零阶优化在LLM量化中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型不同层的权重分布呈现幂律分布特征，基于此特征设计数据生成器来重塑LoRA初始化权重，从而提升LoRA训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型中不同层权重分布的相关性及其对LoRA训练效果的影响，旨在通过理解权重分布特征来优化LoRA初始化策略。

Method: 1) 计算不同层权重矩阵的余弦距离，发现幂律分布特征；2) 提出定性方法描述模型分布特征；3) 结合高斯过程和帕累托分布设计数据生成器；4) 基于分布特征重塑LoRA初始化权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，在不改变模型结构或训练过程的情况下，该方法能够提升LoRA训练的性能表现。

Conclusion: 大语言模型权重分布具有明显的幂律特征，利用这一特征优化LoRA初始化可以有效改善训练效果，为模型微调提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

TL;DR: 人脑受启的内部重放机制在持续学习中能有效减轻坏忘记，但会导致任务分化能力下降和学习塑性与记忆稳定性的交换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工神经网络在持续学习中遇到的坏忘记问题，受人脑记忆汇性机制启发研究内部重放机制

Method: 在CIFAR-100数据集上进行类增量学习实验，评估单独使用内部重放以及与突触智能(SI)结合的效果，使用对数可能分布、重建错误、伪形分数和UMAP投影进行深入分析

Result: 内部重放显著减轻了坏忘记，特别是与SI结合时，但以初始任务准确性下降为代价，同时导致潜在空间表征重叠增加，影响任务特异性

Conclusion: 当前人脑受启方法存在限制，需要找到保持知识与适应能力之间的平衡，为持续学习系统的未来研究指明了方向

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

Motivation: 传统实验方法耗时易错，无法抓取地质异质性，需要更高效准确的氢气吸附预测方法

Method: 提出适应性物理信息神经网络框架，结合经典等温线模型和热力学约束，使用多类别特征工程和深度殊役网络与多头注意力机制

Result: 在155个样品数据集上达到R2=0.979、RMSE=0.045 mol/kg的高精度，收敛速度提升67%，在泥土矿物、项岩和煤矿中均表现优异

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理信息融合和不确定性量化，为地下氢气存储和自然氢气探索提供了高效准确的地点筛选和风险决策支持

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 通过分析俄罗斯卫星在乌克兰入侵前的异常活动，探索是否存在可用于预警未来军事冲突的指标和警告信号。

Method: 采用隔离森林(IF)、传统自编码器(AE)、变分自编码器(VAE)、Kolmogorov Arnold网络(KAN)和新颖的锚损失自编码器(Anchor AE)等深度学习方法，使用5年公开TLE数据基准，分析2022年2月24日入侵前6个月的数据。每个卫星训练单独模型，分析六个轨道元素的异常行为。

Result: 识别出俄罗斯卫星活动在统计上显著的异常行为，并能够确定到具体的轨道元素异常。深度学习自编码器模型通过重构错误超过阈值来识别异常。

Conclusion: 研究证明了俄罗斯卫星在乌克兰入侵前存在统计上显著的异常活动，这些发现可以作为未来军事冲突的预警指标，为理解可能的战术和程序提供基础。

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光网络中基于机器学习的故障管理面临严重的类别不平衡问题，正常实例远多于故障案例，而后处理方法在此领域尚未得到充分研究

Method: 使用实验数据集对预处理、处理中和后处理方法进行直接比较，包括阈值调整、随机欠采样、SMOTE过采样、元学习和生成式AI等方法

Result: 故障检测中后处理方法（特别是阈值调整）F1分数提升最高；故障识别中GenAI方法性能提升最大；不同场景下各方法表现各异：有类别重叠且延迟关键时SMOTE最有效，无延迟约束时元学习最佳，低重叠场景下GenAI方法性能最高且推理时间最短

Conclusion: 不同类不平衡缓解方法在不同故障管理场景下各有优势，需要根据具体应用需求（如延迟要求、类别重叠情况）选择合适的方法

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

Motivation: 传统多层感知机(MLP)只能在单一尺度上操作，缺乏对细节层次(LoD)表示的原生支持，而LoD对于高效建模和传输图像、3D形状等信号至关重要。

Method: 设计Tailed MLP(T-MLP)架构，在MLP的隐藏层上附加多个输出分支（尾部），通过直接监督多个深度来实现多尺度建模，并提出了相应的损失函数和训练策略。

Result: 在多种信号表示任务中，T-MLP的性能优于其他神经LoD基线方法，实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: T-MLP架构成功扩展了MLP的能力，使其能够有效支持多尺度细节层次表示，为信号处理任务提供了更高效的神经网络解决方案。

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language

landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型存在过拟合和无意记忆罕见训练样本的问题，这些被记忆的样本可能被攻击者提取或夸大基准性能，需要一种方法来识别和缓解这种记忆化现象。

Method: 提出生成数据制图(GenDataCarto)框架，为每个预训练样本分配难度分数(早期epoch损失)和记忆分数(遗忘事件频率)，将样本划分为四个象限来指导针对性数据修剪和上/下权重调整。

Result: 在仅修剪10%数据的情况下，将合成canary提取成功率降低40%以上，同时验证困惑度仅增加不到0.5%。

Conclusion: 基于原则的数据干预可以显著减轻数据泄露，同时对生成性能影响极小，证明了数据制图方法的有效性。

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如Best-of-N和多数投票的性能依赖于候选答案质量，当所有候选答案都错误时无法产生正确解，且引入额外模型进行选择会带来高昂部署成本。

Method: 提出GSR框架：统一模型并行生成候选答案，然后基于问题和候选答案进行自我精炼合成更优解。设计了联合优化两个互补目标的混合训练管道：直接解决问题和精炼候选答案。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中达到最先进性能，学习到的自我精炼技能具有模型无关性，在不同模型规模上表现稳健，并能泛化到分布外推理任务。

Conclusion: GSR框架有效解决了现有测试时缩放方法的局限性，通过自我精炼机制显著提升了LLMs解决复杂多步推理问题的能力，且具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 解决教育数据挖掘中隐私法规（如巴西LGPD）限制敏感学生数据集中化的问题，需要隐私保护的计算方法。

Method: 使用联邦学习（FedProx算法）训练深度神经网络模型，模拟50所学校场景，并与集中式XGBoost模型进行性能对比。

Result: 集中式模型准确率63.96%，联邦学习模型峰值准确率61.23%，在保护隐私的前提下性能损失很小。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是巴西教育环境中构建协作预测模型的可行有效解决方案，符合LGPD要求。

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust

Conclusion: 通过输入重排序、权重正则化和门机制非线性化等方法，可以有效改善LSTM模型在长期依赖处理和特定信息优先等方面的性能。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成对抗训练方法独立训练子模型，忽略了子模型间的协作效益，特别是分类差异大的样本对集成鲁棒性影响更大

Method: CEAT利用子模型间的概率差异自适应分配样本权重，加入校准距离正则化，让预测差异大的样本在其他子模型训练中获得更多关注

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，CEAT达到了最先进的性能，优于其他竞争性EAT方法

Conclusion: CEAT是一种模型无关的方法，可无缝适配各种集成方法，具有灵活的适用性

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Conclusion: 这是首次有强力证据表明，在实际条件下检测生成表格数据不仅可行，而且可以高可靠地完成。

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法虽然能保持下游任务性能，但会破坏模型内部用于谎言检测的关键激活特征，这限制了剪枝模型在可信AI应用中的部署。

Method: 提出TPLO方法，基于层间异常值和判别性特征来调整剪枝稀疏度，同时引入提示规则来丰富TruthfulQA基准以更好地校准剪枝过程。

Conclusion: TPLO方法成功解决了LLM剪枝与谎言检测能力之间的权衡问题，为在资源受限环境中部署可信LLM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

TL;DR: PEGE是一种新的梯度估计方法，用于替代STE解决神经网络量化中的离散化误差问题，通过渐进式混合精度替换策略和联合优化任务损失与量化误差，显著提升低比特量化模型的精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的量化感知训练方法使用STE处理离散化函数的不可微问题，但忽略了连续值与量化值之间的离散化误差，导致低比特量化时精度下降。

Method: 提出渐进式逐元素梯度估计(PEGE)，采用对数课程驱动的混合精度替换策略，逐步用量化值替换全精度值，并将QAT建模为同时最小化预测任务损失和量化离散化误差的联合优化问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上的多种架构(ResNet、VGG)实验表明，PEGE始终优于现有反向传播方法，使低精度模型能够达到甚至超越全精度模型的精度。

Conclusion: PEGE提供了一个统一且可推广的框架，能够有效解决量化训练中的离散化误差问题，显著提升低比特量化模型的性能。

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Conclusion: 该框架构建了经典AI与量子计算的协同计算范式，显著降低了使用门槛，为大规模实际优化问题提供了可行的量子加速器路径

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

Result: PMA方法能够有效利用各层表示多样性，提升下游应用性能

Conclusion: 多层级表示融合比单一最后一层表示更优，PMA为ECG Transformer模型提供了更好的表示利用策略

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Method: 使用6个完全枚举的分类反应数据集（768-5684个实验），比较LLM引导优化与贝叶斯优化和随机采样的性能，引入拓扑无关的信息理论框架量化采样多样性。

Conclusion: LLM-GO在传统方法困难的领域表现出色：需要领域理解而非数学优化的复杂分类空间，预训练领域知识实现了更有效的化学参数空间导航。

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

Motivation: Transformer的自回归推理存在KV缓存线性增长和O(N^2 d)计算复杂度的问题，限制了其处理超长序列的能力

Method: 采用周期性状态更新机制，在k-1个连续步骤中执行恒定时间计算，仅在第k步执行一次线性时间的全局信息同步

Result: 理论计算和实验结果表明，TConstFormer在长文本推理任务的速度、内存效率和整体性能方面具有压倒性优势

Conclusion: 这一突破为高效和鲁棒的流式语言模型应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

Conclusion: Neptune通过实现可靠且数据高效的参数推断，在工程、医疗等领域具有广泛的变革性影响

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter

*Ruokai Yin,Sattwik Deb Mishra,Xuan Zuo,Hokchhay Tann,Preyas Shah,Apala Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learn to Shard是一个基于强化学习的分布式LLM推理优化方法，通过联合优化粗粒度并行度策略和细粒度算子分片维度，相比现有系统实现最高3.5倍吞吐量提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布式LLM推理系统（如Megatron-LM）使用静态启发式方法分别配置并行度和算子分片维度，在模型规模扩大和硬件拓扑多样化时无法充分利用性能潜力

Method: 采用基于注意力的强化学习策略，从高性能策略历史中学习，有效探索巨大的组合搜索空间，联合优化粗粒度并行度策略和细粒度算子分片维度

Result: 在H100集群上测试1.6T参数的MoE模型，相比元启发式基线实现最高3.5倍吞吐量提升，相比Megatron启发式方法提升1.06倍

Conclusion: Learn to Shard证明了联合优化并行策略的有效性，为大规模分布式LLM推理提供了更高效的自动配置方案

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

TL;DR: 语音基础模型的表征可以跨领域应用于可穿戴传感器时间序列任务，在情绪分类、心律不整检测等任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音和传感器时间序列数据都在时间域和频域编码信息，探索语音基础模型的跨领域表征学习能力

Method: 使用HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0语音模型提取特征，通过简单的探针方法进行情绪分类、心律不整检测等任务

Result: 语音模型特征超越了直接在特定模态数据上训练的自监督模型，印证卷积特征编码器对可穿戴传感器任务特别重要

Conclusion: 该方法提高了数据稀缺时间序列任务的性能和稳健性，是开发通用时间序模型的重要步骤

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时序预测中Transformer模型的二次复杂度问题和状态空间模型训练不稳定的挑战，需要一种既能保持线性复杂度又能提高稳定性的方法

Method: 结合状态空间模型和变分量子门(RY-RX ansatz)，用量子电路的期望值自适应调节记忆更新，替代昂贵的注意力机制

Result: 在ETT、Traffic和Exchange Rate三个基准数据集上，Q-SSM consistently优于LSTM、TCN、Reformer、Transformer-based模型和S-Mamba等基线方法

Conclusion: 变分量子门机制能够有效解决长范围预测中的当前限制，实现准确且鲁棒的多变量预测，为时序预测提供了轻量级替代方案

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Motivation: 张量分解对分析高维稀疏数据至关重要，但传统专家设计的稀疏张量格式无法适应不规则张量形状和高度可变的数据分布，导致性能挑战。

Method: 采用强化学习自主代理，通过混合无模型和基于模型的算法与TD环境直接交互，发现优化的张量编码，并引入规则驱动的动作掩码和动态信息动作过滤机制确保功能正确性。

Conclusion: ReLATE框架通过自适应学习能够自动生成高效的稀疏张量表示，有效解决了传统方法无法适应不规则形状和数据分布的问题，显著提升了张量分解性能。

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Result: 通过扩展探索实现了采样器性能的改进，经验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 连续温度扩散采样器通过改进提案分布和增强探索能力，有效提升了神经采样器的性能。

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

TL;DR: TabPFN v2在多个表格数据基准测试中超越了基于树的模型，但受限于transformer的二次计算和内存成本，无法处理超过10K上下文token。本文提出了一种tiled-block策略来计算注意力，使TabPFN能够无需预处理即可处理长上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TabPFN v2因transformer架构限制而无法处理长上下文的问题，现有方法依赖上下文压缩（如KNN选择代表性样本），但需要预处理步骤。

Method: 引入tiled-block策略在TabPFN框架内计算注意力，该设计与标准GPU设置兼容，无需任何预处理即可处理长上下文。

Result: 在标准TabArena基准测试中证明了该方法的有效性，使TabPFN能够处理超过10K token的长上下文。

Conclusion: 提出的tiled-block策略是首个使TabPFN无需预处理即可处理长上下文的解决方案，在表格数据任务中表现出色。

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Conclusion: 该方法为现实推荐场景中的反事实学习和评估提供了实用的解决方案，能够有效平衡偏差校正和方差控制。

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散模型实际上学习的不是真实的分数函数，而是Wasserstein梯度流的速度场，这解释了为什么即使神经网络向量场不是保守的，生成采样仍然成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为扩散模型学习的是噪声数据对数密度的梯度（分数函数），但这要求学习目标是保守向量场，而实际使用的神经网络架构并未强制执行这一约束。

Method: 通过数值实验证明训练好的扩散网络违反了真实分数函数的积分和微分约束，提出将扩散训练理解为Wasserstein梯度流速度场的流匹配。

Result: 发现扩散模型学习的向量场不是保守的，但作为生成机制表现优异，非保守的神经网络近似误差不一定损害密度传输。

Conclusion: WGF视角为理解扩散生成模型提供了原则性、优雅且理论基础坚实的框架，消除了对反向时间SDE理论的依赖。

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

Motivation: 虽然PERL方法在数值实验中显示出优于纯神经网络的性能优势，但这些结果缺乏理论解释，无法充分说明其内在机理。

Method: 研究具有Lipschitz连续性问题的一般类别，通过分析损失函数边界与残差学习结构之间的关系，严格证明了一组解释PERL三大优势的定理。

Result: 理论分析证实了PERL的三大优势，自动驾驶轨迹预测的数值实验表明，即使使用显著更少的训练样本，PERL仍能比纯神经网络获得更高的精度。

Conclusion: PERL在提高预测性能的同时减少了所需数据量，在真实世界自动驾驶应用中具有重要价值，特别是在难以获取极端案例数据的情况下。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有初始化方法（如He、Xavier、正交初始化）在深度ReLU网络中无法有效控制预激活均值和激活稀疏性，导致神经元永久失活（dying ReLU）和梯度不稳定问题。

Method: 在Stiefel流形上求解优化问题，推导出闭式解和高效采样方案，专门为ReLU网络设计正交初始化来保持尺度并校准预激活统计量。

Conclusion: 提出的优化正交初始化方法能有效稳定深度ReLU网络的信号和梯度流动，为深度网络训练提供了更可靠的初始化方案。

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Conclusion: 通过课程学习渐进规制个性化过程，有效缓解了子图联邦学习中的数据异质性问题，提升了模型聚合效果

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Conclusion: Metis为先进低比特量化下的稳健和可扩展LLM训练铺平了道路，代码已开源。

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available
at: https://github.com/typename-yyf/Metis-quantization.

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

TL;DR: 本文证明了Transformer的记忆能力随提示长度线性增长，且存在上下文长度增加时性能下降的内在限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管提示调优在实践中成功，但理论分析有限。现有工作主要关注通用近似特性，本文探索Transformer的记忆能力这一不同理论方面

Method: 提供两个主要理论贡献：1) 证明Transformer记忆信息量不能超过提示长度的线性缩放；2) 首次形式化证明大语言模型中观察到的扩展上下文性能下降现象

Result: 严格证明Transformer具有有限内存，无论上下文大小如何，其保留信息的能力都受到限制

Conclusion: 这一发现提供了对Transformer架构内在局限性的基本理解，特别是其处理长序列的能力

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

Motivation: 过去对ReLU激活函数的激活稀疏性研究不适用于现代LLM模型，需要一个通用框架来系统研究这种现象。

Method: 提出了一个通用框架来评估稀疏性稳健性，对现代LLM的FFN层进行了系统研究。

Result: 发现了LLM中普遍的激活稀疏性模式，提供了对该现象的深入见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为利用激活稀疏性进行模型设计和加速提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Motivation: 图像自回归(IAR)模型虽然在生成速度和质量上表现优异，但存在训练数据记忆问题，引发隐私担忧。需要深入研究记忆发生的位置和方式。

Method: 通过细粒度记忆测量分析不同IAR架构的记忆模式，对比层次分辨率架构和标准自回归模型，并对关键记忆组件进行干预处理。

Result: 发现层次架构中记忆早期出现且随分辨率加深，而标准模型记忆集中在后期处理阶段。通过干预最记忆组件，在很小影响生成质量的情况下显著减少了数据提取能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图像生成模型的内部记忆机制，为减缓隐私风险提供了实用策略，在保持图像质量的同时有效控制数据泄漏。

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN通过交互融合框架和区域感知机制，有效提升了交通预测性能，解决了现有方法在多视角时空建模和区域异质性处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型将基因视为无结构标记，忽略了已知的通路结构和基因间相互作用，需要更精细的基因级建模方法。

Method: 使用图注意力网络（GAT）在基因级别建模生物通路，通过边干预编码药物机制，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在未见治疗条件下预测通路动态时，GAT比MLP的MSE降低81%；成功从原始时间序列mRNA数据中重新发现TP53-MDM2-MDM4反馈环的所有五个基因相互作用。

Conclusion: GAT框架能更好地捕捉通路拓扑结构，具有从实验数据生成新生物学假设的潜力，为基因通路建模提供了更精确的方法。

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习攻击策略仅破坏全局模型性能，但攻击者自身模型也会受损。现实中攻击者追求竞争优势，希望获得优于其他参与者的模型

Method: FedThief框架：上传阶段修改内容降低全局模型性能；使用分歧感知集成技术（量化私有与全局模型偏差）整合全局更新和本地知识来增强私有模型

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效降低全局模型性能，同时攻击者获得的集成模型显著优于全局模型

Conclusion: 提出了自中心联邦学习攻击新范式，攻击者既能破坏全局模型又能提升自身模型性能，展示了联邦学习中的新型安全威胁

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

TL;DR: 提出ASC方法，融合数值金融数据和文本记录进行信用监控，通过优化权重参数和特征向量选择，在1428家中小企业数据集上取得比基线方法高18%的轮廓系数。


<details>

Motivation: 异构数据（数值金融变量和文本记录）给信用监控带来重大挑战，需要开发能够有效整合这两种数据类型的方法。

Method: 先进谱聚类(ASC)方法，通过优化权重参数整合金融和文本相似性，采用新颖的特征值-轮廓优化方法选择特征向量。

Result: 在1428家中小企业数据集上，ASC的轮廓系数比单类型数据基线方法高18%；51%的低风险企业包含'社会招聘'术语；招聘导向型中小企业违约风险低30%；在k-means、k-medians、k-medoids等多种算法中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ASC通过将谱聚类理论与异构数据应用相结合，能够识别有意义的聚类模式，为更有针对性和有效的信用干预提供支持。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Conclusion: SA-DSD框架有效解决了GNN到KAN知识蒸馏中的性能退化问题，显著提升了边缘设备上的模型压缩和推理效率

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过层次控制微分方程框架，有效分离系统退化与运行变量，提升健康状态监测的准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以从以运行变量为主的传感器数据中准确推断缓慢的系统退化过程，殊法解耦退化与运行动态

Method: 提出层次控制微分方程(H-CDE)框架，包含慢速(退化)和快速(运行)组件，采用多尺度时间积分、可学习路径变换和单调激活函数等创新技术

Result: 在动态响应(桥梁)和稳态(航空发动机)系统中，H-CDE在退化推断方面表现超过余题基准方法，实现了更准确、稳健和可解释的结果

Conclusion: H-CDE框架有效解决了系统退化推断中的时间尺度分离和数值稚性问题，为工程系统健康监测提供了更可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Conclusion: AMCR框架为解决生成模型中的版权问题提供了全面解决方案，能够在不影响图像质量的情况下有效减少版权侵权，推动生成技术的安全实际应用

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了CAEL-MIPS方法，通过学习上下文-动作嵌入来最小化MIPS估计器的均方误差，解决了传统IPS方法在大动作空间或未充分探索区域方差大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IPS方法在大动作空间或未充分探索的上下文-动作空间存在显著方差问题，现有的MIPS方法虽然利用动作嵌入缓解了这一问题，但未考虑上下文信息且不能最小化估计器的均方误差。

Method: 提出CAEL-MIPS方法，从离线数据中学习上下文-动作嵌入，基于MIPS的偏差和方差理论分析，构建了最小化均方误差的目标函数。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据集上的实证研究表明，该估计器在均方误差方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS通过联合学习上下文-动作嵌入有效降低了MIPS估计器的均方误差，为离线策略评估提供了更准确的估计方法。

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future

Method: 集成进化多目标优化自适应平衡损失、副本交换随机梯度Langevin动力学改善参数空间探索、内置贝叶斯不确定性量化

Result: 在一维Burgers方程和时间分数混合扩散波方程等测试中，在精度、噪声鲁棒性和不确定性量化能力方面均优于传统算子学习方法

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了算子学习中损失平衡、噪声鲁棒性和不确定性量化等关键问题，为参数偏微分方程求解提供了新方法

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低数据条件下，如何高效地引导生成模型探索药理学相关的化学空间仍然是药物发现中的主要挑战。需要开发能够在有限训练数据下生成具有特定性质的新分子的方法。

Method: VECTOR+框架结合了属性引导的表征学习和可控分子生成，适用于回归和分类任务。该方法使用对比学习来学习分子表示，并通过属性条件生成来产生具有目标性质的新分子。

Result: 在PD-L1抑制剂数据集（296个化合物）上，VECTOR+生成了8374个分子，其中100个分子的对接分数超过-15.0 kcal/mol，最佳分数达到-17.6 kcal/mol（参考抑制剂为-15.4 kcal/mol）。分子动力学模拟证实了结合稳定性（配体RMSD < 2.5埃）。在激酶抑制剂任务中也表现出优于现有药物的性能。

Conclusion: VECTOR+是一个强大且可扩展的方法，在低数据条件下实现了属性条件的分子设计，成功桥接了对比学习和生成建模，为AI加速的药物发现提供了可重复的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

TL;DR: 提出DELTA框架解决隐私保护数据重编程问题，通过两阶段变分解耦生成学习，在提升目标任务性能的同时显著降低隐私泄露风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据常包含敏感属性且受严格法规约束，现有特征工程主要关注下游任务性能而忽视隐私泄露风险，需要新的隐私保护数据重编程方法

Method: 两阶段变分解耦生成学习框架：第一阶段使用策略引导强化学习发现具有下游任务效用的特征变换；第二阶段使用变分LSTM seq2seq编码器-解码器，结合效用-隐私解耦潜在空间设计和对抗-因果解耦正则化

Result: 在8个数据集上实验表明，DELTA将预测性能提升约9.3%，隐私泄露减少约35%

Conclusion: DELTA框架能够实现稳健的隐私感知数据转换，有效平衡效用和隐私保护需求

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络在时空预测中存在复杂波动模式和频谱纠缠问题，而现有的分解集成方法如VMGCN虽然通过信号分解提高了精度，但存在计算效率低下和需要手动超参数调优的局限性。

Method: 提出了模式自适应图网络(MAGN)，包含：(1)展开式VMD(UVMD)模块，用固定深度网络替代迭代优化，大幅减少分解时间；(2)模式特定的可学习带宽约束，自适应空间异质性并消除手动调优。

Result: 在LargeST基准测试(6,902个传感器，2.41亿个观测值)上，MAGN相比VMGCN减少了85-95%的预测误差，并优于最先进的基线方法，分解时间减少了250倍。

Conclusion: MAGN成功解决了传统分解方法的计算效率和参数调优问题，为大规模时空预测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在虚拟筛选实验中，BALD-GFlowNet达到了与标准BALD基线相当的性能，同时生成了更多结构多样的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种效率高、可扩展的分子发现方向，具有较强的实用价值。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

Conclusion: TAAM通过动态调制冻结骨干网络的内部计算流，为导航稳定性-可塑性困境开辟了新路径，是一种高效且有效的持续图学习解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

TL;DR: ProCause是一个新的生成式深度学习方法，用于评估预测性过程监控方法，通过整合多种因果推理架构和时序模型来改进RealCause方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RealCause方法忽略了过程数据中的时序依赖性，且仅依赖单一TARNet架构，限制了评估预测性过程监控方法的有效性

Method: 提出ProCause方法，支持序列模型（如LSTM）和非序列模型，整合多种因果推理架构（S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet和集成模型）

Result: 研究发现TARNet并非总是最佳选择，集成模型提供更一致的可靠性，LSTM在存在时序依赖时能改善评估效果。真实数据分析验证了ProCause的实用性

Conclusion: ProCause通过多架构集成和时序建模，为预测性过程监控方法提供了更可靠的评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释人工智能领域提供了一个实用的因果感知模型解释框架，尤其在需要理解真实因果关系的健康领域具有重要价值

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Motivation: 传统人才识别方法依赖人工流程、过于关注学业成绩且干预时机较晚，忽视了非学术才能和早期干预机会。

Method: 使用半监督多模态神经网络（Transformer+LSTM+ANN），基于1041名中学生的离线教育数据，通过聚类奖项记录和提取学习行为特征来预测七种才能类型。

Result: 模型取得了0.908的分类准确率和0.908的ROCAUC值，表现出优秀的预测性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够早期识别学生多样化才能，为教育干预提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and
in-distribution counterfactual samples.

TL;DR: DTRNet是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过动态令牌路由机制，让大多数令牌跳过二次复杂度的注意力计算，只保留线性更新，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer对所有令牌在每个层都应用二次复杂度的自注意力计算，计算成本高昂。需要一种更高效的架构来减少计算开销，特别是对于长序列输入。

Method: 提出动态令牌路由网络(DTRNet)，保留MLP模块，但让大多数令牌跳过昂贵的注意力计算，只进行线性更新。只有约10%的令牌会经过完整的注意力处理。

Result: DTRNet在保持与完整Transformer相当性能的同时，显著降低了计算FLOPs。在相同FLOPs下，比MoD和D-LLM等路由方法在准确率和内存效率上表现更好，且计算效率随序列长度增加而提升。

Conclusion: DTRNet通过解耦令牌更新和注意力混合，大幅减少了二次计算部分，提供了一个简单、高效且可扩展的Transformer替代方案。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

Motivation: 图神经网络难以解释，因为消息传递混合了信号且内部通道很少与人类概念对齐，需要研究潜在空间中的特征叠加现象

Method: 使用具有明确图概念的受控实验，在图形级别提取类条件质心特征，在节点级别提取线性探测方向特征，并用简单的基不变诊断分析其几何结构

Result: 发现宽度增加产生重叠相位模式，拓扑结构将重叠印记到节点特征，池化部分重新混合为任务对齐的图形轴，更锐利的池化增加轴对齐并减少通道共享

Conclusion: 这些结果将表示几何与具体设计选择（宽度、池化和最终层激活）联系起来，并提出了使GNN更具可解释性的实用方法

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统Transformer的二次注意力复杂度限制了长序列的可扩展性，而线性模型虽然计算高效但可能因无法保留远距离token的详细信息而导致性能下降。

Method: 提出SCOUT架构：1）使用Mamba或滑动窗口注意力线性混合器在固定大小段内局部压缩token；2）每个token稀疏关注少量压缩的检查点token来总结输入历史；3）只在压缩表示上应用注意力。

Result: 在相同计算预算下，SCOUT在长上下文语言建模和推理任务中优于强基线；在400M和1.3B规模上匹配全注意力Transformer的语言建模和常识推理性能；相比SOTA模型获得更高的端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: SCOUT通过局部压缩和稀疏注意力的混合设计，在保持接近全注意力性能的同时实现了次二次方的内存增长，为长序列建模提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致优于SMOTE、NearMiss等传统方法，平均提升宏F1分数2.64个百分点，统计显著

Conclusion: ART是不平衡分类中可靠的选择，能够持续提供最强的宏F1性能

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法参数空间刚性，无法动态激活适当的神经通路来灵活适应多样化和演化的数据分布。

Method: 提出混合专家提示调优(MEPT)，利用专家混合架构集成多个提示专家来自适应学习多样化和非平稳数据分布。

Result: 在SuperGLUE上优于多个最先进的参数高效基线方法，平均准确率提升1.94%，同时显著减少79.25%的激活提示。

Conclusion: MEPT作为有效的流形映射框架，通过流形学习和神经激活通路可视化的理论见解得到验证，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

TL;DR: FlexMDM是一种灵活的掩码扩散模型，支持可变长度序列生成，解决了传统MDM只能生成固定长度序列的限制，在数学推理和代码填充任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型(MDMs)虽然具有并行生成和任意顺序推理的优势，但无法支持token插入，只能生成固定长度的序列，这限制了其在实际应用中的灵活性。

Method: 基于随机插值框架扩展，FlexMDM通过在序列中插入掩码token并逐步解掩码的方式，实现了可变长度序列的生成，同时保持了MDMs的任意顺序推理能力。

Result: FlexMDM在困惑度上与MDM相当，但能更好地建模长度统计特性；在迷宫规划任务上成功率比MDM基线高约60%；将LLaDA-8B微调为FlexMDM后，在数学推理(GSM8K从58%提升到67%)和代码填充(从52%提升到65%)任务上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: FlexMDM成功解决了MDM固定长度生成的限制，提供了灵活的可变长度序列生成能力，同时保持了高效的并行推理特性，在多个任务上展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

TL;DR: 提出基于大腦模型LaBraM的相關性注意力映射方法，利用IMU數據的空間通道關係來識別EEG信號中的運動偽影，相比傳統單模態方法顯著提升了運動場景下的魯棒性。

Motivation: EEG信號易受運動偽影污染，傳統單模態方法（如ASR、ICA）未充分利用IMU等同步記錄的運動信息，限制了腦機接口在真實場景中的部署。

Method: 使用精調的大型腦模型LaBraM，通過相關性注意力映射利用IMU數據的空間通道關係來識別EEG運動偽影。模型僅用5.9小時EEG-IMU數據訓練（佔基礎模型訓練數據的0.2346%），參數量約920萬。

Conclusion: 結合IMU運動信息的跨模態方法能更有效地去除EEG運動偽影，為腦機接口在真實運動環境中的應用提供了重要改進。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Motivation: 小型语言模型在生成概率程序时经常产生语法和语义错误，特别是推理构造方面的缺陷。受概率程序员领域专业知识和调试策略的启发，需要一种方法来确保生成的程序包含有效分布和良好参数。

Method: 引入RefineStat框架：1) 强制执行语义约束确保程序包含有效分布和良好参数；2) 应用诊断感知细化，在可靠性检查失败时重新采样先验或似然组件。

Conclusion: RefineStat通过语义约束和诊断感知细化，有效解决了小型语言模型生成概率程序时的错误问题，为统计模型发现提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Conclusion: 证明了SC-GIR框架在学习紧凑且信息丰富的潜在表征方面的有效性，为目标导向语义通信系统提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将performative prediction推广到非线性情况，同时保持了关键的理论性质，为现实世界应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 自适应深度消息传递方法能有效解决节点间计算需求差异问题，提高GNN模型性能

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

Method: 提出StoxLSTM，在xLSTM架构中引入随机潜在变量，构建状态空间建模框架，通过专门设计的循环块建模潜在动态演化过程。

Result: 在多个研究社区的公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，StoxLSTM始终优于最先进的基线方法，具有更好的鲁棒性和更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: StoxLSTM通过将随机建模与xLSTM结合，显著提升了时间序列建模的性能，为处理复杂真实世界时间序列数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

### [400] [Preserving Vector Space Properties in Dimensionality Reduction: A Relationship Preserving Loss Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01198)
*Eddi Weinwurm,Alexander Kovalenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了关系保持损失(RPL)函数，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵差异来保持向量空间的正交性和线性独立性等关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维过程会扭曲向量空间的关键属性（如正交性和线性独立性），这些属性对于跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务至关重要。

Method: 使用关系保持损失(RPL)函数，通过比较高维数据和低维嵌入的Gram矩阵或余弦相似度矩阵的差异来训练神经网络进行非线性投影，并基于矩阵扰动理论推导误差边界。

Result: 初步实验表明RPL能够在减少嵌入维度的同时，在很大程度上保持下游任务的性能，这归功于其对关键向量空间属性的保持。

Conclusion: RPL不仅适用于降维任务，还可广泛应用于跨域对齐和迁移学习、知识蒸馏、公平性和不变性、去中心化、图和流形学习以及联邦学习等领域，确保分布式嵌入保持几何一致性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解学习的物理机制提供了新视角，能够将新信息整合到现有知识结构中，促进生物与人工智能系统的对齐

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了消息传递复杂度(MPC)来替代传统的表达力理论，认为过度关注表达力是偏差的，MPC能更好地描述GNN在实际任务中的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表达力理论存在两大问题：一是对于大多数实际任务考虑过度表达力没有必要，二是二元化的理论偏向与实际GNN能力存在差距。需要一种更精确反映GNN实际能力的评量框架。

Method: 提出消息传递复杂度(MPC)测量方法，通过连续值来量化GNN架构解决特定任务的难度。MPC能够捐换实际限制如过压缩问题，同时保持理论不可能性结论。

Result: 通过对基础GNN任务的广泛验证，发现MPC的理论预测与实践性能呈现明显相关性，成功解释了各种GNN架构的成功与失败案例。

Conclusion: MPC框架超越了传统表达力理论，为理解和改进GNN架构提供了更强大和细致的理论支撑，有效缩小了理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算系统中，自主智能体需要在有限观测和通信约束下快速做出本地决策并竞争共享资源。现有MARL方法依赖集中式评论家或频繁通信，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 每个智能体解决约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)，通过共享约束向量进行隐式协调。约束防止共享服务器资源过载，使用安全强化学习确保策略满足本地和全局目标。

Result: 在理论保证下验证了方法的有效性，实验显示在大规模设置中性能优于集中式和独立基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的去中心化框架通过轻量级协调机制实现了有效的资源协调，在有限通信条件下表现出色，特别适合大规模边缘计算场景。

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在处理需要组合规则和分布外示例的推理任务时面临系统泛化挑战，特别是在数学推理方面表现有限

Method: 采用迭代示例选择策略，逐步构建优化的少样本示例集，结合显式推理指令来增强模型性能

Result: 实验表明LLMs在非标准优先级代数表达式简化任务中表现有限，但通过该方法可获得更好的泛化性能，且简单示例比复杂示例效果更好

Conclusion: 迭代示例选择策略能有效提升LLMs的系统泛化能力，简单示例在提示策略中可能比复杂示例更有效

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Result: 混合数据集在所有数据集上获得最佳评分，对状态空间表示至关重要，显著提升了替代模型性能

Conclusion: 该方法改进了现有技术水平，为在复杂仿真器上应用替代辅助强化学习策略优化铺平了道路

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种等变U型神经算子(E-UNO)，用于高效学习Cahn-Hilliard方程控制的相分离过程，通过结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率架构，实现了对相场变量演化的准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高且缺乏灵活性，现有神经算子方法无法有效捕捉多尺度行为和物理对称性，需要开发更高效的替代模型。

Method: 采用等变U型神经算子架构，结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率U型结构，通过调节平移等变性来符合底层物理规律，从短历史动态中学习相场演化。

Result: E-UNO在精细尺度和高频结构预测上优于标准Fourier神经算子和U型神经算子基线，具有更好的泛化能力、更少的训练数据需求和物理一致性。

Conclusion: E-UNO成为复杂相场系统的高效替代模型，通过编码对称性和尺度层次结构，实现了物理一致的动力学预测。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于重构不确定性估计(RUE)的预测区间方法，用于生命体征预测中的不确定性量化，以增强临床决策的可信度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生命体征预测中表现出潜力，但由于缺乏可靠的不确定性量化（特别是校准的预测区间），临床医生难以信任和解释模型输出，限制了在医疗领域的部署。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）参数化方法 - 假设预测误差和不确定性估计遵循高斯copula分布，实现闭式预测区间计算；2）非参数化方法 - 基于k近邻(KNN)，使用相似验证实例经验估计条件误差分布。

Result: 在两个大型公共数据集（分钟级和小时级采样）上的实验表明，高斯copula方法在低频数据上持续优于一致性预测基线，而KNN方法在高频数据上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RUE衍生的预测区间在提供可解释、不确定性感知的生命体征预测方面具有临床前景，能够帮助区分有意义的警告和模型噪声。

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的强化学习验证奖励方法需要大量计算和数据集，导致训练成本高、数据效率低，需要更高效的数据选择策略。

Method: 结合离线阶段基于多样性、影响力和适当难度的高质量数据筛选，以及在线阶段基于探索性指标的动态样本过滤，并加入重放机制确保充分训练。

Conclusion: DEPO通过智能数据选择策略有效提高了RLVR训练的数据效率和计算效率，为大规模推理模型的训练提供了更经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Method: 提出灵活掩码自编码器（FMAE）框架，能够从异构数据中学习统一的电池表示，支持缺失数据通道的处理。

Conclusion: FMAE展示了一种实用的灵活、数据高效模型路径，简化了动态系统多任务管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 该框架通过理论基础的全局结构信息提取，充分利用优化净面的深层几何特性，为优化算法提供了新的全局视角

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

Conclusion: 提出的AT损失函数有效解决了CSI在无降雨期间的限制，显著提高了降雨预报的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Result: CbLDM相比现有模型显示出显著更高的预测精度，能够有效解决纳米结构逆问题。

Conclusion: CbLDM在纳米结构逆问题上表现优异，具有处理其他连续条件生成任务的潜力。

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Result: 在合成长距离任务中，该方法能够超越传统方法在原始拓扑上的理论限制，偏好分层结构的游走可以达到与原始图上更长游走相同的性能

Conclusion: 这些初步发现为高效处理大型图同时有效捕获长距离依赖开辟了有前景的方向

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

Motivation: VQ-VAE等离散潜在空间深度生成模型虽有优秀的数据生成能力，但因潜在空间过大而被认为概率推断不可处理。研究者尝试破解这一偏见。

Method: 通过选择高概率的潜变变量子集，将VQ-VAE精炼为概率电路模型。这种简单策略在VQ-VAE潜在空间未充分利用时特别有效。

Result: 实验结果显示在密度估计和条件生成任务中具有竞争力的性能，同时保持了VQ-VAE的表达能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将VQ-VAE转换为可处理的概率模型，挑战了VQ-VAE本质上不可处理的观点，为离散潜在空间模型的概率推断提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

Motivation: 填补文献中关于实例依赖成本敏感分类器的损失函数对模型解释稳定性影响的空白，满足日益增长的监管透明度要求

Method: 使用四个公开信用评分数据集，评估IDCS分类器的判别能力和成本效率，并通过控制重采样研究SHAP和LIME特征重要性排名在不同类别不平衡程度下的稳定性

Result: IDCS分类器提高了成本效率，但相比传统模型产生了显著不稳定的解释，特别是随着类别不平衡增加，解释稳定性进一步恶化

Conclusion: 在监管对可解释性要求日益严格的背景下，迫切需要解决IDCS分类器的稳定性问题，确保其成本优势不会被不稳定或不可信的解释所削弱

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

<details>

Motivation: 传统数值求解器在参数化研究和设计优化中的计算开销巨大，需要一种既能加速求解又能保持物理约束的新方法。

Method: 将参数偏差残差作为附加源项，使用任何训练好的神经算子进行离线精化，将神经算子预测嵌入迭代PDE求解器作为改进的初始猜测。

Result: 在单组参数训练的神经算子成功加速了异质、正弦和不连续参数分布的求解，计算时间减少约50%，同时保持全阶保真度。

Conclusion: MD-PNOP框架有效解决了神经算子的外推限制，实现了跨广泛参数配置的泛化，为参数化PDE求解提供了高效且物理可信的加速方案。

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动描述方法需要高级别标注的运动数据，但现有数据集中缺乏这种标注和低级别详细描述，限制了模型的表现。

Method: 采用两步分层次方法：首先用大语言模型生成详细的低级别描述用于重新训练，然后通过检索机制将详细描述与外部文本源中的高级别描述对齐，结合运动特征生成精确的高级别描述。

Result: 在三个运动-文本数据集（HumanML3D、KIT、BOTH57M）上进行实验，在BLEU-1、BLEU-4、CIDEr和ROUGE-L指标上平均性能提升6%-50%，超过了最新的M2T-Interpretable方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够利用外部文本源的知识来大幅提高运动描述的准确性，尤其是对于现有数据集中未覆盖的运动。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Conclusion: PAFlow通过创新的先验交互指导和原子数预测机制，有效解决了SBDD中的关键问题，在生成高亲和力分子的同时确保了分子质量的稳定性。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Result: 在四个公开ECG数据集上验证有效，能够识别新异常同时保持现有ECG信号的检测性能

Conclusion: 提出的伪重放持续学习框架在ECG异常检测中表现优异，解决了存储限制和类别不平衡问题

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Conclusion: FoRo为预训练模型的持续学习提供了有前景的方向，特别适用于效率和效果都至关重要的实际多媒体应用。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Method: 通过在标准数据集、大型分子数据集和合成数据集上进行系统实验，比较GCL与未训练GNN、MLP和手工统计特征的性能差异。

Result: 在标准数据集上，未训练方法可与GCL匹敌；在ogbg-molhiv数据集上，GCL仅在大规模数据(数千图以上)时才有优势但会饱和；在合成数据上，GCL性能随数据量对数增长且性能差距随任务复杂度变化。

Conclusion: 需要重新评估GCL基准测试中数据集规模的作用，并设计能够避免性能饱和的GCL算法。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac引导的CFM方法为流匹配模型提供了有效的精确控制机制，在化学计算等需要精确属性控制的领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

Motivation: 随着微调模型数量增加，模型合并可能侵犯开发者权益和泄露敏感信息，现有方法无法有效防止非法合并。

Result: 实验显示MergeLock在大多数情况下能将合并模型性能降低95%以上，且无法通过低成本恢复方法有效恢复。

Conclusion: MergeLock能有效防止未经授权的模型合并，保护模型开发者的权益和隐私安全。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is

*Bram van den Akker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AddIPW估计器的干扰感知提升建模方法，通过可微分学习目标直接优化经济收益，在存在干扰效应的推荐系统中显著优于传统方法。

Motivation: 传统提升建模方法忽略了推荐系统中的干扰效应（一个物品的处理会影响其他物品的结果），这违反了SUTVA假设，导致在真实市场环境中产生次优策略。

Method: 使用Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW)估计器作为可微分学习目标，结合梯度优化方法，并与响应转换技术集成，直接优化增量利润等经济指标。

Conclusion: 该框架为激励个性化提供了实用的盈利优化路径，通过干扰感知的提升策略可以实现更有利可图的推荐系统优化。

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

TL;DR: Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法有效处理生态瞬时评估中的不规则时间数据，在纵向压力预测任务中优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动和可穿戴传感技术结合生态自评问卷为人类行为纵向建模提供了机会，但缺失数据和不规则时间自报告带来了挑战

Method: 提出Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法，专门设计用于处理不规则间隔的自报告数据，捕捉时间依赖性

Result: Ema2Vec在纵向压力预测任务中表现优于依赖固定大小日窗口的标准基线方法，以及没有时间感知表示的模型

Conclusion: 在建模不规则采样的纵向数据时，纳入时间嵌入至关重要

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决聚类联邦学习(CFL)中聚类时机选择的问题，传统方法需要手动调整超参数，缺乏自动化检测最佳聚类时刻的能力。

Method: 基于客户端梯度间的余弦距离计算和温度测量来检测联邦模型开始收敛的时刻，采用一次性聚类算法，支持多种密度基聚类方法。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上的40多个任务测试显示良好性能，验证了基于梯度的密度聚类方法在区分不同数据分布神经网络损失曲面方面的高效性。

Conclusion: OCFL算法能够自动化进行聚类联邦学习，无需超参数调整，同时通过GradCAM局部解释性分析揭示了个性化与本地预测可解释性之间的关系。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类移动数据复杂性导致的模型训练困难和仅预测下一位置忽略隐式决定因素的问题

Method: 采用熵驱动课程学习策略（基于Lempel-Ziv压缩量化轨迹可预测性）和多任务训练（同时优化位置预测、移动距离和方向估计）

Result: 在HuMob挑战中达到最高性能：GEO-BLEU(0.354)和DTW(26.15)指标，收敛速度提升2.92倍

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合课程学习和多任务学习，有效提升了人类移动预测的准确性和效率

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 梯度因果发现方法容易受到数据分布偏差的影响，本文识别了两种偏差：边际分布不对称性和边际分布偏移不对称性，并通过实验展示了这些偏差如何影响因果学习，同时提出了控制偏差的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度因果发现方法虽然高效且可扩展，但容易受到训练数据分布偏差的影响。本文旨在识别和分析这些分布偏差对因果结构学习的具体影响，并提出相应的解决方案。

Method: 针对二元分类设置和Dirichlet先验，使用两个简单模型来学习边际或条件数据分布（这是梯度因果发现的常见策略），通过合成数据实验展示偏差的存在和影响，并测试消除因果分解竞争的方法。

Result: 实验证明梯度因果发现方法确实容易受到边际分布不对称性和边际分布偏移不对称性的影响，但通过消除可能因果分解之间的竞争，可以使模型对这些偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分布偏差是梯度因果发现方法的一个重要问题，但通过适当的方法设计（如消除因果分解竞争）可以有效控制这些偏差，提高因果学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模的最新进展表明强化学习在微调中的重要性，特别是KL正则化方法对自回归和扩散模型非常有效。RTB作为GFlowNets中的目标函数被提出用于改进序列生成模型的微调，本文旨在建立RTB与现有KL正则化RL方法之间的联系。

Method: 基于先前将GFlowNets与最大熵RL联系起来的工作，本文建立了RTB与Trust-PCL（一种带有KL正则化的离策略RL方法）之间的等价关系，并通过重新分析RTB论文中的示例来验证这种等价性。

Result: 研究结果表明RTB与Trust-PCL在理论上等价，KL正则化RL方法能够达到与RTB相当的性能表现，这为之前报道的结果提供了不同的视角。

Conclusion: 本文成功地将RTB置于KL正则化强化学习的更广泛理论框架中，阐明了其与早期方法的关系，并证明KL正则化RL方法可以作为RTB的有效替代方案，为序列生成模型的微调提供了新的理论见解和实用方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Conclusion: 研究为预训练设计选择提供了重要见解，帮助实践者在蒸馏训练中平衡测试时扩展和上下文学习能力的权衡。

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Result: 在4个PDE标准测试中，每个情况都有变种能达到或超越修改DeepONet的准确性，同时提升训练效率，且最佳变种与每个方程的物理特性自然匹配

Conclusion: 跨条件调节的有效性依赖于方程的特性和物理机制，新方法在保持简单性和效率的同时显著提高了准确性

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Result: 在MLEBench上，使用RL训练的Qwen2.5-3B小模型比提示Claude-3.5-Sonnet大模型的代理性能高出22%

Conclusion: 通过RL训练小模型可以超越静态大模型，为代理学习提供了新方向

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

Conclusion: 所提出的CMMN扩展方法有效改善了EEG信号频谱一致性，为自动化伪迹去除提供了更好的工具，具有临床诊断价值

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效的联邦大语言模型蓄笔方案，有效解决了带宽限制下的通信挑战，为隐私保护协作学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Motivation: 当前强化学习基准测试主要关注确定性或过度简化设置，缺乏对真实随机性和部分可观测性的系统评估，阻碍了RL方法在现实世界条件下的鲁棒性发展

Method: 引入STORI基准测试，包含多样化的随机效应；提出RL环境中随机性的分类法，为分析和比较方法提供统一框架

Result: 创建了一个能够严格评估RL方法在不同形式不确定性下表现的基准测试系统，并建立了系统化的随机性分类体系

Conclusion: STORI基准和随机性分类法填补了现有研究的空白，为评估和提升RL方法在真实随机环境中的鲁棒性提供了重要工具

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Motivation: COVID-19大流行对心血管疾病患者造成严重影响，需要准确建模生物标志物变化来预测疾病进展和指导预防性护理，但现有方法未能同时处理多目标预测、生物标志物相互依赖性和时间模式

Method: 提出MBT-CB模型，结合预训练BERT-based transformer框架，使用贝叶斯变分推断估计不确定性，通过嵌入捕获时间关系，DeepMTR模型捕获生物标志物相互关系

Result: 在3,390份CVD患者EHR数据上评估，MBT-CB优于其他BERT-based ML模型，MAE为0.00887，RMSE为0.0135，MSE为0.00027，有效捕获数据模型不确定性、患者生物标志物相互关系和时间动态

Conclusion: MBT-CB的优越性能表明其在改善CVD生物标志物预测和支持大流行期间临床决策方面具有潜力

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Conclusion: TSAIA基准为评估LLM在时间序列分析中的能力提供了重要工具，凸显了开发专门方法以适应领域特定需求的重要性

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

Motivation: 传统的分割符合预测(SCP)数据利用效率低，而全部符合预测(FCP)需要重新训练导致计算复杂度过高，需要找到一种既高效又保证覆盖率的方法

Method: 提出E-ICL+FCP框架，使用排列不变的Transformer模型进行上下文学习，通过CP感知损失函数进行训练，模拟FCP所需的多次重新训练模型

Result: 在合成咄实际任务上，E-ICL+FCP在保持覆盖率的同时，显著提高了效率咄减少了计算开销，达到了更优的效率-覆盖率交换

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP框架通过结合元学习咄符合预测感知损失，有效解决了传统符合预测方法的主要缺陷，为可信度AI提供了更高效的不确定性量化方法

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

TL;DR: GradES是一种基于梯度的早停方法，通过在transformer组件级别监控梯度收敛情况，逐个冻结已收敛的参数矩阵，避免了传统全局验证的昂贵计算成本，实现了1.57-7.22倍的训练加速和1.2%的平均准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早停方法需要监控全局验证损失并同时停止所有参数更新，对于大型transformer来说验证推理时间过长，计算成本高昂。

Method: 在transformer组件（注意力投影和前馈层矩阵）级别跟踪反向传播中的梯度幅度，当某个投影矩阵的梯度低于收敛阈值τ时，单独排除该矩阵的更新，允许收敛慢的矩阵继续学习。

Result: 训练时间加速1.57-7.22倍，平均准确率提高1.2%，通过早期防止过拟合增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: GradES通过组件级别的梯度监控和选择性参数冻结，有效解决了传统早停方法的计算效率问题，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Conclusion: SQS成功解决了现有技术的缺陷，为神经网络提供了既高效又可解释的特征学习能力

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with

Conclusion: 研究展示了SAV辅助车辆与机器学习技术整合在公共交通中的潜力，为解决多式转换系统中的首末一公里问题奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地平衡了计算效率和解决方案质量，特别适合时间紧急的灾后应急响应场景，为救援生命提供了关键的快速决策支持。

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

Result: 优化后的随机森林模型在测试集上达到89.18%的准确率和0.9586的ROC AUC值，车辆基本特征(整备质重和款式年份)占据了超过55%的特征重要性

Conclusion: 机器学习可以有效分析大规模NCAP数据，既传统车辆参数也是现代ADAS功能都对获得顶级安全评级具有重要预测价值

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

TL;DR: VISP是一种基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化方法，通过动态计算梯度统计量来调整随机投影矩阵的噪声注入，选择性地正则化高波动性节点，提升深度神经网络的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法使用均匀噪声或固定dropout率，无法根据网络内部动态调整正则化强度。VISP旨在利用梯度波动性信息来实现更智能的自适应正则化。

Method: VISP动态计算梯度统计量来衡量波动性，基于此波动性缩放随机投影矩阵，选择性地对高梯度波动性的输入和隐藏节点进行正则化，同时保持稳定表示。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP相比基线模型和固定噪声方法能持续提升泛化性能。分析显示VISP能稳定网络内部动态并促进更鲁棒的特征表示。

Conclusion: VISP通过梯度波动性指导的自适应噪声注入，提供了一种有效的正则化方法，能够改善深度神经网络的泛化能力和内部稳定性。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both

problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of

autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Method: 构建预测编码模型来模拟新皮层，测试其在少量和大量训练样本下的记忆表现

Conclusion: 新皮层能用密集重叠表示逐渐编码有限数量的具体示例，但仍需要海马体的稀疏模式分离表示来处理大量经验

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

Conclusion: 结合BPS和PT的新算法能够有效加速多峰后验分布的取样收敛，为复杂模型的负负分布推断提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Conclusion: So-TPDEGs框架为处理多交互图数据提供了更有效的连续建模方法，特别在保留高频信息和捕捉复杂结构方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

Motivation: 传统遗传编程演化的预约规则缺乏维度一致性，导致规则难以被最终用户理解和信任，需要开发能够保持维度一致性的演化方法。

Method: 开发了维度感知的遗传编程算法，包含维度修复程序，将维度修复建模为混合整数线性规划问题，在保持结构的同时优化维度一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够演化出高质量且维度一致的预约规则，为设计更有效和可解释的医疗预约规则提供了新思路。

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

TL;DR: 该研究通过系统性实验发现，许多自称比AdamW更快的优化器实际速度提升较底且随模型规模增大而减少，只有1.1倍。质疑以往研究在超参调整和评估方法上的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决优化器比较中的两大方法论问题：(i)不公平的超参数调整和(ii)有限或误导性的评估方案，以确保公正的性能对比。

Method: 对4种模型规模(0.1B-1.2B参数)和4种数据-模型比例(1-8倍Chinchilla最优值)进行系统性研究，涉及10种深度学习优化器的严格超参数调整和训练结束后评估。

Result: 发现矩阵基优化器(Muon、Soap等)速度最快，但速度提升随模型规模增大而减少：从0.1B模型的1.4倍降至1.2B模型的1.1倍。中间检查点比较可能误导，因为优化器排名在训练过程中可能发生反转。

Conclusion: 矩阵预条件器优化器在小规模模型上有显著优势，但在大规模模型上优势减小。公平的优化器比较需要严格的超参数调整和在多种模型规模、数据比例下进行训练结束后评估。

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

TL;DR: 提出双层优化框架平衡隐私保护和数据效用，上层关注数据质量，下层基于流形曲率进行针对性隐私保护


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习训练需要数据集但直接共享原始数据存在隐私风险，现有隐私保护技术往往降低数据质量，需要在隐私保护和数据效用间找到最优平衡

Method: 双层优化框架：上层任务通过判别器确保扰动后的潜在变量映射到高质量样本；下层任务利用数据流形上的局部外在曲率量化个体对成员推理攻击的脆弱性，通过向低曲率区域扰动来抑制易受攻击的显著特征组合

Result: 实验评估表明该方法不仅增强了下游任务对成员推理攻击的抵抗能力，而且在样本质量和多样性方面超越了现有方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过交替优化实现了隐私保护和数据效用的协同平衡，为解决隐私保护与数据效用间的权衡问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

Conclusion: 通过考虑数据依赖的噪声尺度，该方法能更好地处理蛋白质数据的异质分布，为稀疏高维数据的生成建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

TL;DR: CIML是一个基于信息理论的多视图学习框架，摒弃了多视图冗余假设，同时利用共同信息和独特信息进行预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图学习方法假设共同信息对下游任务足够且必要，但忽略了每个视图中独特信息的预测潜力。本文旨在开发一个更全面的框架，充分利用两种信息。

Method: 提出CIML框架：1）共同表示学习通过最大化Gacs-Korner共同信息提取共享特征，再基于信息瓶颈压缩为任务相关表示；2）独特表示学习使用信息瓶颈获得最压缩的独特表示，同时最小化独特与共同表示之间以及不同独特表示之间的互信息。

Result: 理论证明学习到的联合表示对下游任务具有预测充分性。大量实验结果表明该模型优于多个最先进方法。

Conclusion: CIML框架成功突破了传统多视图冗余假设的限制，通过同时利用共同和独特信息，在多视图学习中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Conclusion: 该方法为多任务模型合并提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，能够在维持所有任务高性能的同时避免任务干扰。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Result: 在重心计算、颜色和风格迁移、图像生成以及纹理合成等数值实验中，验证了所提方法在不同设置下的多功能性和有效性。

Conclusion: 可微分EM算法为现代机器学习流程提供了重要工具，特别是在需要端到端梯度优化的应用中，如基于Wasserstein距离的损失函数计算。

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Conclusion: HiGraph数据集填补了分层图数据集的空白，为构建鲁棒的恶意软件检测器提供了重要资源，数据集和工具已公开可用

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset
for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly
available at https://higraph.org.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau
\). We study variants where the optimal arm is the first above \(\tau\), the
\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

Motivation: 当前视觉地点识别方法存在计算开销高、跨域转移性差的问题，需要一种无需微调但保持语义理解能力的方案。

Method: 提出了一种零样本框架，采用测试时缩放(TTS)技术，通过指导基方法利用MLLM的视觉-语言对齐能力进行直接相似性计分，使用结构化提示生成长度可控的JSON输出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了当前VPR方法的计算效率和跨域适应性问题，为视觉地点识别领域提供了一种高效、可扩展的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IT系统因果模型依赖领域专家构建和维护，但随着系统复杂性和动态性增加，这种方法越来越困难。需要自动化方法来识别因果模型以支持系统预测、优化、诊断等任务。

Method: 采用主动因果学习方法，通过基于rollout的干预策略收集系统测量数据，使用高斯过程回归迭代估计系统变量间的因果函数。该方法在贝叶斯意义下是最优的。

Result: 在测试平台上的实验验证表明，该方法能够准确识别因果系统模型，同时对系统操作产生的干扰较低。

Conclusion: 提出的主动因果学习方法为IT系统提供了有效的在线数据驱动因果模型识别方案，解决了传统专家方法的局限性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conditional-$t^3$VAE通过为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，解决了传统VAE在类别不平衡数据上潜在空间分配不均的问题，显著提高了生成公平性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE和$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上，潜在空间分配与类别频率成正比，导致尾部类别表示不足，生成公平性降低。

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE，为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，使用γ-power散度推导的闭式目标进行优化，并推导等权重潜在混合分布用于类别平衡生成。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE在严重类别不平衡情况下始终获得比$t^3$VAE和基于高斯的VAE基线更低的FID分数，在每类F1评估中也表现更优。

Conclusion: 在严重类别不平衡情况下，Conditional-$t^3$VAE显著提高了生成公平性和多样性，而基于高斯的方法在轻度不平衡时仍具竞争力。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测-优化方法假设更准确的预测会产生更接近最优的解，但这种假设在复杂约束优化问题中缺乏实证支持，需要系统分析预测误差对解质量的影响。

Method: 提出了多分类器预测模拟算法，扩展了现有的二分类模拟方法，通过模拟机器学习模型的预测来实验分析预测误差对解质量的影响，避免了训练真实模型的需求。

Result: 算法能够以合理精度模拟分类器性能，实验表明预测误差与解接近最优的程度之间存在非平凡关系，并非简单的线性相关。

Conclusion: 预测误差对优化解质量的影响复杂且非线性，这对基于机器学习预测的决策系统设计和评估提出了重要考量，需要更细致的性能评估方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Motivation: 现有AD框架存在编程语言支持有限、需要代码修改、科学计算性能不足、存储策略简单等问题，迫使领域科学家手动计算大型问题的梯度。

Method: 提出DaCe AD自动微分引擎，采用新颖的基于整数线性规划(ILP)的算法，在给定内存约束下优化存储与重计算的权衡以达到最佳性能。

Result: 在NPBench高性能计算基准测试套件上，DaCe AD平均比当前最先进的通用AD框架JAX快92倍以上，且无需任何代码修改。

Conclusion: DaCe AD解决了现有AD框架的主要限制，为科学计算和机器学习应用提供了高效、通用的自动微分解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

Motivation: 传统静态基准测试无法捕捉医疗咨询的动态交互特性，导致医疗大语言模型在真实临床决策中的实用性存在差距。

Method: 建立大规模高保真交互式强化学习系统，包含患者模拟器（使用去标识化医疗记录）和临床评估生成器（动态生成多维度评估指标），采用改进的Group Relative Policy Optimization算法进行多阶段强化学习训练。

Result: Baichuan-M2在HealthBench上表现优异，超越所有开源模型和大多数先进闭源模型，在HealthBench Hard基准上获得32分以上（此前仅GPT-5达到）。

Conclusion: 强大的动态验证系统对于将LLM能力与实际临床应用对齐至关重要，为医疗AI部署建立了新的性能-参数权衡帕累托前沿。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过超图建模有效捕捉了多尺度时空依赖关系，为多变量时间序列预测提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Conclusion: 在时间关键的应急响应场景中，虽然分析方法能保证完全凝聚但速度过慢，VariAntNet在速度和连接性之间提供了更好的权衡，证明了深度学习在分散控制中的实用性。

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

Method: 通过统一视角将校准视为预测器假设世界与真实世界（由自然或贝叶斯最优预测器控制）之间的不可区分性，各种校准度量量化了这两者被特定类别的区分器或统计度量区分开来的程度。

Result: 提出了校准作为不可区分性的统一理论框架，为不同校准度量提供了理论基础和解释。

Conclusion: 校准误差的测量应该基于下游决策者的需求，不可区分性视角为理解和比较不同校准方法提供了有力的理论工具。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

TL;DR: 提出UDI方法，通过单向动态交互和顺序训练策略解决多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，避免强模态压制弱模态，提升多模态学习性能


<details>

Motivation: 多模态联合损失会导致模态不平衡，强模态压制弱模态，限制了单个模态信息和模态间交互信息的充分利用。现有方法都是被动检测和纠正不平衡，未能从根本上解决联合损失的竞争性问题

Method: 提出单向动态交互(UDI)策略，放弃传统联合损失，采用主动的顺序训练方案：先训练锚定模态至收敛，然后用其学习到的表示通过无监督损失指导其他模态，动态调整模态交互以适应任务需求

Result: 实验结果表明UDI在处理模态不平衡方面优于现有方法，在多模态学习任务中实现了性能提升

Conclusion: UDI通过解耦模态优化和启用定向信息流，有效防止单一模态主导，促进跨模态特征学习，为多模态不平衡学习提供了新的有效策略

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDIT是一个即插即用的概率时间序列预测框架，通过结合点估计和基于残差的条件扩散，使用双向Mamba网络实现最优分布匹配，在多个数据集上取得了更低的CRPS分数和更快的推理速度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有概率时间序列预测方法存在分布建模不理想以及训练与评估指标不匹配的问题，研究发现为强点估计器添加零均值高斯分布可以取得优异性能。

Method: 提出RDIT框架，结合点估计和基于残差的条件扩散，使用双向Mamba网络，理论证明可以通过调整最优标准差来最小化CRPS，并推导实现分布匹配的算法。

Result: 在8个多元数据集上的评估显示，RDIT相比强基线实现了更低的CRPS、更快的推理速度和更好的覆盖率。

Conclusion: RDIT框架通过创新的点估计与条件扩散结合方法，有效解决了概率时间序列预测中的分布建模和指标匹配问题，取得了state-of-the-art性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的成功依赖于参与者不可见的行为，需要从战略系统角度分析规则和激励机制，以识别真正改善性能的行为与仅针对指标的行为之间的差异。

Method: 提出分析框架，引入两个量化指标（行为激励和集体性能损失），开发阈值、自动切换规则和预警信号检查表，提供有限审计资源分配算法和性能保证。

Result: 在不同环境下的模拟验证了框架预测的模式，提供了完整可复现的程序，展示了在现实操作变异性下的稳健应用。

Conclusion: 通过周期性重新校准、随机化和基于连接性的警报组合，可以降低指标游戏的激励，同时维持和扩展稳定的合作，提供了设计原则和操作指南。

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

TL;DR: 该论文通过实验验证发现，原先提出的Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG)数据集复杂度测量在知识图连接预测任务中存在稳定性和相关性问题，无法有效预测模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估数据集复杂度对知识图连接预测模型的评比至关重要，需要验证CSG指标在该预测任务中的可靠性和有效性。

Method: 通过系统性实验，在FB15k-237、WN18RR等标准数据集上测试CSG指标的稳定性，分析其与连接预测性能指标如平均倒数排名(MRR)的相关性，并考察关键参数K(最近邻层数)和M(蒙特卡洛采样点数)的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示CSG对参数K选择极为敏感，不能自然随目标类别数量扩展；与MRR等标准性能指标的相关性弱或无相关性，在连接预测场景下失效。

Conclusion: 该研究告诉我们需要更健壮、与分类器无关的复杂度测量方法来评估知识图连接预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Motivation: 随着神经网络成为测量系统的重要组成部分，需要理解它们如何处理和传输参数相关信息，特别是Fisher信息在神经网络中的传播机制。

Method: 开发了一种监控Fisher信息从输入层到输出层在神经网络中流动的方法，跟踪参数估计任务中的信息传输过程。

Result: 发现最优估计性能对应于Fisher信息的最大传输，训练超过此点会导致信息损失（过拟合），该方法可作为无需验证集的训练停止准则。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了模型无关的训练停止标准，在成像实验等实际物理场景中验证了有效性，为理解神经网络信息处理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Conclusion: 层感知的专家缓存管理算法能有效提升MoE架构的性能，为大型语言模型的高效部署提供了重要的内存管理解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Conclusion: 所提出的非线性镜像映射方法为元学习提供了更有效的距离度量机制，能够处理复杂损失几何，在减少计算成本的同时保持理论收敛性能，适用于大规模元学习模型。

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM方法虽然通过寻找平坦最小值来提高泛化能力，但在实践中存在"过度友好对抗"问题，限制了最终的泛化性能。

Method: 提出VASSO（方差抑制）方法来稳定对抗扰动，通过抑制扰动方差来避免过度友好的对抗样本，可与计算高效的SAM变体结合使用。

Result: 在广泛的视觉和语言任务上数值验证了VASSO+SAM组合的改进泛化能力，提供了更好的泛化-计算权衡。

Conclusion: VASSO提供了一种通用方法来稳定对抗扰动，有效解决了SAM中的过度友好对抗问题，显著提升了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models

ML-driven power system research.

Motivation: 多轮工具集成推理(TIR)的强化学习训练存在不稳定性和性能崩溃问题，主要原因是外部工具反馈导致的分布漂移和低概率token生成，进而引发灾难性梯度爆炸。

Method: 提出SimpleTIR算法，核心策略是识别并过滤掉包含无效轮次(既不生成代码块也不产生最终答案)的轨迹，从策略更新中移除这些有问题的轨迹，从而阻断有害的高幅度梯度。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR是一种即插即用的算法，能有效稳定多轮TIR训练，避免监督微调的限制，使模型能够发现更丰富和复杂的推理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Conclusion: HydroGAT通过高分辨率异构图表示和时空联合建模，显著提升了洪水预测精度，同时保持了计算效率和模型可解释性，为水资源管理提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic
reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be
achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.
