### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习来区分StyleGAN生成的图像与真实图像，通过2D DFT变换和ResNet50网络，在频域中检测GAN图像的周期性伪影，准确率达到92.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统构成严重挑战，需要有效方法来区分真实与合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，然后使用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上训练分类器来区分真实和合成图像。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理技术和深度学习的方法具有增强数字取证和加强工业AI系统可信度的工业潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了结合Vision Transformers和对比学习目标在3D形状特征表示学习中的效果，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时面临挑战，需要大量标注数据且CNN可能忽略关键的形状关系。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标相结合，包括监督对比学习和自监督对比学习，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比损失达到约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT能够理解整体形状，对比学习能优化局部判别特征，这种组合克服了需要大量标注数据和CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的限制。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个基于查询的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过transformer平滑器和融合跟踪器提升3D检测器的性能，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法在多模态传感器融合方面存在不足，需要开发能够充分利用相机和LiDAR信息的鲁棒跟踪框架，特别是在遮挡和视角变化情况下。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包含基于transformer的时间平滑器和融合驱动跟踪器。使用多模态BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型，通过两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪管道实现身份分配和传播。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上获得74.7 aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现强劲，减少了身份切换，同时保持了竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: 查询式transformer跟踪方法从多模态传感器特征中获益显著，即使数据有限且无需预训练，也能与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)通过动态调整软标签来改善医学图像分类中的过自信预测问题，在RadImageNet数据集上相比传统方法提升了分类准确率和特征表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过自信预测，影响可靠性。传统标签平滑方法不考虑类别间关系，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)方法，在训练过程中根据模型自身的预测模式动态调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS相比硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏等方法，在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率上均有提升，并产生更紧凑和分离良好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还提高了校准度，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对鱼眼图像的目标检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道以及模型集成策略，在鱼眼交通图像上实现鲁棒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其强径向失真和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道增强检测一致性，训练多个先进检测模型并通过集成策略结合输出。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中获得F1分数0.6366，在62支队伍中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的检测问题，在严重失真条件下实现了鲁棒检测。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度敏感性分数解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练分布外视角下的视觉噪声问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的视角下会产生大量视觉噪声，这是由于外推区域缺乏训练数据导致密度、颜色和几何预测的不确定性

Method: 利用中间梯度导出的敏感性分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，直接解决生成不确定性的核心问题

Result: 实验评估表明，相比现有的NeRF方法如BayesRays，该方法显著提升了视觉质量、真实感和一致性

Conclusion: 该过滤方法能够实时无缝集成到现有3DGS渲染管线中，无需大量事后重新训练或微调，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角外时仍能保持高视觉保真度

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个混合两阶段框架，结合物理建模与机器学习，通过可移动低计数换能器部分阵列采集和变换器超分辨率编码器-解码器，在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下实现准确的大脑声速定量成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统物理全波形反演方法因颅骨引起的信号衰减、模式转换和相位畸变限制，以及纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下产生定量偏差的问题。

Method: 第一阶段应用逆时偏移（时间反转声学）处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于变换器的超分辨率编码器-解码器与图注意力单元融合片段生成连贯准确的声速图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验显示，BrainPuzzle实现了优越的声速重建精度和图像完整性。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，通过混合算法补偿缺失孔径，提高可行性和耦合效果。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个标准化评估框架，用于诊断生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，发现模型倾向于默认北方国家现代风格描绘，迭代编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且编辑模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知的更改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑器的文化偏见研究不足，需要建立一个统一的可比较诊断协议来填补这一空白。

Method: 使用固定设置的开放模型，在六个国家进行跨国家、跨时代、跨类别评估，结合标准自动指标、文化感知的检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的判断。

Result: 研究发现：1）在国家无关提示下，模型默认北方国家现代风格描绘；2）迭代编辑会侵蚀文化保真度；3）编辑模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知更改。

Conclusion: 当前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍然不可靠，通过发布标准化数据、提示和人类评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法FIBAR，用于从事件相机数据重建强度图像。该方法使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号，通过新颖的算法检测陈旧像素并进行高斯滤波，能够在CPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于神经网络的事件图像重建方法通常需要GPU，计算复杂度高。本文旨在开发一种更简单、高效的异步重建方法，能够在CPU上实时处理事件数据。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号强度变化；通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素并维护最近更新像素窗口；对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波；支持任意时间的异步图像读取。

Result: FIBAR在现代笔记本电脑CPU上处理速度约为42（140）百万事件/秒（启用/未启用空间滤波）；重建图像比神经网络方法更嘈杂且存在重影，但足以完成某些任务如检测基准标记。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单高效的异步事件图像重建方法，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在CPU上具有实时处理能力，适用于某些特定应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TBTLRR模型，通过自适应张量核范数和双边结构改进图像聚类，增强对噪声的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效捕捉全局和局部相关性

Method: 引入数据自适应张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性，集成ℓ1/2-范数和Frobenius范数正则化，基于ADMM开发优化算法

Result: 大量实验验证在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型通过自适应变换和双边结构有效提升图像聚类性能，对复杂噪声具有更好鲁棒性

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源的跨平台应用程序，用于标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构性和隐私问题，支持手术数据科学应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中具有潜力，但受到异构记录格式和视频共享隐私问题的限制。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期和以用户为中心的迭代反馈开发。基于隐私设计架构，通过内部和外部临床医生调查评估可用性和采用度，并进行跨硬件配置的基准测试。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性评分（临床医生4.68/5，计算机科学家4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，但需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力卷积（ATConv），通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制机制来改进传统卷积，使其在保持线性复杂度的同时达到甚至超越自注意力的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强大，但二次复杂度限制了实际应用。传统卷积具有线性复杂度但性能存在差距，需要重新审视卷积设计以捕获自注意力的本质表达能力。

Method: 提出ATConv，在卷积操作中引入两个关键原则：自适应路由（根据语义内容动态调节位置信息流）和侧向抑制（通过权重竞争抑制冗余、锐化表示）。

Result: 仅使用3×3核的ATConv在基础视觉任务中持续超越各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中替换自注意力可降低FID 0.15并加速采样。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积框架，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了卓越性能，为视觉骨干网络提供了新的设计方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StableSketcher框架，通过优化VAE编码器和集成基于视觉问答的强化学习奖励函数，提升扩散模型生成手绘草图的质量和文本对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成像素级手绘草图（抽象表达的代表）方面仍面临挑战，需要提高生成草图的质量和文本提示的保真度。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器以优化潜在解码，更好地捕捉草图特征；2. 集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数，通过强化学习改善文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher生成的草图具有更好的风格保真度，与提示的对齐度优于Stable Diffusion基线。

Conclusion: 该框架成功提升了扩散模型生成手绘草图的能力，同时创建了首个包含实例级草图、标题和问答对的数据集SketchDUO，解决了现有数据集依赖图像-标签对的局限性。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效连接生物图像与多模态基础模型，为生物多模态学习提供了新的监督范式。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

TL;DR: 提出LogitGap方法，通过利用最大logit与其他logits之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分性，在多种OOD检测场景中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法未能充分利用模型logits空间中丰富的信息，特别是最大logit与其他logits之间的关系。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，显式利用最大logit与剩余logits的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logits子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多样化OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logits空间中的关系信息，为OOD检测提供了一种高效且强大的后处理方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有数据集如PartNet依赖无纹理几何和专家标注，限制了可扩展性和实用性，需要新一代数据集来解决这些问题。

Method: 构建包含纹理3D模型的大规模数据集，采用可扩展的标注方法，提供分层部件标签，并在类无关部件分割和3D部件中心问答两个任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 在细粒度和叶级部件分割任务中，现有方法表现不佳；在3D部件问答任务中，3D-LLMs在开放词汇部件定位方面存在显著差距；使用PartNeXt训练的Point-SAM相比PartNet有显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单张RGB图像估计自行车8D姿态的方法，除了6D姿态外还能估计车把和踏板的旋转角度，解决了传统6D姿态估计在自行车这类铰接物体上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于易受伤害的道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统6D姿态估计无法处理自行车铰接部件（车把、踏板）的变化，这些变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出类别级8D姿态估计方法，联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点，使用合成和真实图像数据进行训练以实现泛化。

Result: 方法在8D姿态参数估计上表现出有竞争力的结果，相比使用刚性模板匹配的最先进6D姿态估计器取得了可比性能。

Conclusion: 8D姿态估计能够提供更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向信息，对自动驾驶中的骑行者安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，在封闭世界和开放世界设置下均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: TOMCAT方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，解决现有方法在解耦表示学习中的局限性，提升潜在空间的可解释性和解耦效果。

Method: 在生成器中引入中间随机层，约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息，该层作为可学习的潜在分布与生成器联合端到端训练。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAE和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架有效实现了GAN的解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

Result: 在Sintel数据集上，PPMStereo在clean/final测试集上分别达到0.62/1.11 TEPE，相比BiDAStereo分别提升17.3%和9.02%，且计算成本更少。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程实现了高效的长程时空一致性建模，在精度和时间一致性方面均达到最先进水平，为增强现实等应用提供了可靠的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续性特征，限制了早期干预和可解释性。可疑意图具有长期依赖性和累积效应，需要连续建模。

Conclusion: 连续可疑建模方法能够实现更早检测和主动干预，大大增强了系统可解释性和在安全应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但目前缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在强烈不平衡，预处理步骤改善了数据集内一致性但无法消除数据集间差异，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残余协变量偏移。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++是一个跨阶段的提示优化框架，通过检索增强提示优化、样本特定提示优化和LLM微调三个阶段，显著提升文本到视频生成质量，无需修改底层生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示往往简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Method: 第一阶段：检索增强提示优化(RAPO)，通过关系图检索语义相关修饰符并重构提示以匹配训练分布；第二阶段：样本特定提示优化(SSPO)，使用多源反馈迭代优化提示；第三阶段：利用SSPO优化的提示对微调重写器LLM。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

### [27] [FlowCycle: Pursuing Cycle-Consistent Flows for Text-based Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20212)
*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle提出了一种基于流的无反转图像编辑框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化图像损坏过程，并使用循环一致性约束来优化目标感知的中间状态，从而在保持源图像一致性的同时实现更准确的文本引导编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽视了与特定编辑目标之间的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或结果不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习噪声参数化图像损坏过程，使用循环一致性过程优化噪声，通过源到目标再到源的迭代编辑过程，在双重一致性约束下学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建方法，能够实现更忠实的内容修改同时保持源图像一致性，解决了当前方法在语义差距较大时编辑效果不佳的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出CURL框架，通过自监督对比学习从胎儿超声视频中检测胎儿运动，结合空间和时间对比损失，在92个受试者数据集上达到78.01%的敏感性和81.60%的AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性强和准确性有限的问题，需要更客观可靠的检测方法。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习框架，结合空间和时间对比损失，引入任务特定采样策略，并通过概率微调方法实现任意长度超声记录的分析。

Result: 在92个受试者的30分钟超声会话数据集上，CURL达到78.01%的敏感性和81.60%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [30] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来解决大型视觉语言模型在长文本响应中的幻觉问题，发现幻觉风险主要源于对上下文依赖的增加而非单纯的长度因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在长文本响应中更容易产生幻觉，传统观点认为是长度导致的错误累积，但本文质疑这一机制，探索是否存在更深层的原因。

Method: 通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，并在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了持续且显著的改进，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险主要由长文本响应中对上下文依赖的增加引起，而非长度本身。该研究为深入探索LVLM幻觉问题提供了新视角和初步探索。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于高斯泼溅的方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果不佳，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致错误累积。需要解决这些限制。

Method: 提出协作场概念（实例场+语言场），通过实例到语言特征映射和两阶段训练策略构建协作场，在推理时使用自适应语言到实例提示优化。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并展示了在图像驱动的3D分割、分层分割和机器人应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场设计有效整合了语言和分割线索，实现了高质量的开放词汇3D分割，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: DualGround是一个双分支架构的视频时序定位方法，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频-语言对齐，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VTG方法在跨模态注意力中统一处理所有文本标记，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而无法有效利用词级信号进行细粒度时序对齐。

Method: 提出双分支架构，将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；引入标记角色感知的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试的Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 解耦语义建模在视频-语言对齐中具有有效性，能够同时捕获粗粒度和局部化语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限

Method: 提出掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征；整合为EDGeo端到端框架

Result: 在两个公共数据集上实现最先进性能，在具有挑战性的地面到卫星场景下定位精度提升3.39%

Conclusion: 为跨视角地理定位研究提供了稳健的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the

Result: 在四个数据集上达到或超越SOTA性能，在语义不一致场景下表现优异

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息丢失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够保持完整几何信息的方法。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断LiDAR传感器的关键内在参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束校准校正，实现无损投影。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保留的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过利用多模态信息的多样性来细化提取的特征，有效减少视觉特征中的冗余，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCR方法虽然预测准确率高，但忽略了数据集中的偏见问题，缺乏有效的去偏策略。研究发现文本和视觉数据中都存在共现和统计偏见。

Method: 分析VCR中的因果图和预测捷径，采用后门调整方法消除偏见。基于正确答案集合创建字典来消除预测捷径。

Result: 实验证明该去偏方法在不同数据集上都有效。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法能有效提升VCR模型的泛化能力，VCR-OOD数据集为评估模型性能提供了新基准。

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

TL;DR: 提出KINN框架解决CV-SAR图像识别中的表示三难问题，通过物理引导压缩和语义压缩实现参数高效、泛化性强且可解释的识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CV-SAR图像识别在数据有限和领域偏移场景下面临的泛化性、可解释性和效率之间的三难问题，充分利用SAR数据中丰富的电磁散射特征

Method: 基于'压缩-聚合-压缩'架构的轻量级框架，包含物理引导压缩、特征聚合和语义压缩三个阶段，采用字典处理器嵌入物理先验，使用自蒸馏学习任务相关嵌入

Result: 在五个SAR基准测试中达到参数高效识别的最先进水平，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下表现出卓越的泛化能力和可解释性

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了第一人称视角带来的独特挑战，如理解多个事件和识别手物交互

Method: 开发反事实样本构建模块，通过事件描述改写和核心交互挖掘生成文本和视觉模态的正负样本，然后与原始样本一起输入基线模型，最后应用对比损失优化

Result: 在EgoTaskQA的normal和indirect分割上分别达到52.51%和46.04%，在QAEGO4D上达到13.2%，均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: DMC³框架有效解决了第一人称视频问答中的独特挑战，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有GUI grounding方法将指令视为静态的用户意图代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，且利用指令多样性可在推理时带来76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1）在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT），培养多视角推理能力；2）通过强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B在五个挑战性基准测试中取得SOTA结果：UI-I2E-Bench 87.3%、ScreenSpot-Pro 57.0%、MMBench-GUI L2 84.9%。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 提出的Instruction-as-Reasoning范式有效提升了GUI grounding性能，模型展现出涌现推理能力，能够选择性地组合和合成新的指令路径，同时缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要大量计算资源，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP、SAM）缺乏与语言在多粒度级别的对齐，导致训练效率低下。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构，通过动态双曲半径调整优化视觉表示与文本的对齐。使用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作，提供三种参数化策略：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET仅增加不到1%的参数就能显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET提供了一个高效且灵活的训练范式，能够有效解决多模态大语言模型中视觉-文本跨模态对齐的粒度差距问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩在泛化方面的关键挑战，包括缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和低效处理OOD数据的问题。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验捕捉鲁棒的上下文依赖关系；2. 实例自适应微调(IAFT)：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调网络权重子集并纳入比特流。

Result: 在包含15个多样化数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略，有效解决了点云压缩中的泛化问题，为可复现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会在多个去噪步骤中累积，影响生成质量。现有方法独立处理每个步骤的误差，无法有效解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant在量化过程中显式模拟多个去噪步骤，考虑误差累积效应，并提出高效实现技术将内存复杂度从O(n)降低到O(1)。

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中，AccuQuant展现出优异的效能和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过考虑量化误差在多步去噪过程中的累积效应，显著提升了扩散模型量化后的性能，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Conclusion: PE-Field通过将位置编码扩展到3D空间，使DiTs能够直接建模几何，在视觉生成任务中取得了显著改进，证明了位置编码在控制空间一致性方面的重要作用。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像-食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致跨模态表示学习忽略非视觉但关键的食谱细节，在区分相似食谱时存在困难。

Method: 提出因果表示学习方法，预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并显式将这些元素注入跨模态表示学习以缓解偏见。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化美食数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的因果表示学习方法能够有效缓解图像-食谱检索中的表示偏见问题，提高对细微食谱差异的识别能力。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频推理方法存在局限性：基于强化学习的方法依赖纯文本链，导致结论缺乏视觉基础或产生幻觉；基于帧检索的方法虽然引入视觉基础，但在证据定位方面仍不准确。

Method: 构建了Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，包含帧识别、证据推理和行动决策；设计了多阶段渐进式冷启动策略与识别-推理-行动强化学习训练框架，联合增强多步视觉推理。

Result: 在六个多步推理基准测试中，Conan平均准确率比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct高出10%以上，达到最先进性能；在长视频理解任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Conan框架有效解决了视频推理中的证据定位和多步推理挑战，具有强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性，为多模态大语言模型的视频理解能力提供了重要提升。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Result: 在多个数据集和训练设置下，该方法在性别和种族推断上优于强基线，特别是在更具挑战性的种族属性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，通过提高推断可靠性来减少公平性估计的偏差和方差。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化，通过教师-学生模型的协同训练和双向反馈机制，显著提升单步扩散模型对新概念的个性化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单步文本到图像扩散模型虽然能快速生成高质量图像，但在个性化新概念方面存在局限，因为单步模型难以有效捕捉新概念的分布。

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，同时训练多步扩散模型（教师）和单步扩散模型（学生）。采用双向概念蒸馏机制：概念从教师蒸馏到学生，再从学生反馈给教师。共享文本编码器确保语义一致性，并使用对抗损失和对齐损失优化学生模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅提升了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还提高了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型中的快速有效个性化建立了新范式，通过双向概念蒸馏机制实现了协同优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出Metis-HOME混合专家框架，通过思考分支和非思考分支解决多模态推理模型在效率与通用性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询也使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专业推理损害了更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型重构为两个专家分支：思考分支用于复杂多步推理，非思考分支用于快速直接推理。使用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B实现MoE架构。

Result: 该方法不仅显著增强了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型中观察到的退化趋势。

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建强大且通用多模态大语言模型的新范式，有效解决了推理与泛化之间的普遍困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题，包括数据标注不可靠、无法建立文本解释与视觉证据的联系，以及不支持任意面部区域查询。

Method: 定义面部图像概念树进行细粒度区域划分，开发FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程，提出伪影定位解释任务，构建统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在伪影定位解释任务上优于强基线，在现有可解释深度伪造分析数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度面部上下文感知，显著提升了深度伪造分析的可解释性和准确性。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在处理严重模糊时效果不佳。

Method: 使用投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过可微分模糊创建模块实现。神经网络预测完整的3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的恢复网络进行端到端训练，并通过重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合估计清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，提供了可解释性，并能重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，在复杂模糊情况下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

TL;DR: ACamera-Net是一个轻量级、场景自适应的相机参数调整网络，直接从RAW输入预测最佳曝光和白平衡，解决复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光等）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管线中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下具有良好的泛化能力。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法，且无需依赖额外的图像增强模块。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net通过直接优化相机参数，有效解决了复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题，为边缘设备提供了高效的图像质量增强解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，通过整合显式的时空证据到视频推理中，在生成答案时突出显示关键时间戳、对象和边界框，使推理能够基于具体的视觉观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频推理模型通常只生成文本推理轨迹，而不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。虽然OpenAI-o3等模型在图像证据中心推理方面引起了广泛兴趣，但将此能力扩展到视频更具挑战性，因为它需要在动态场景中进行联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 首先策划构建了两个高质量数据集：用于SFT的STGR-CoT-30k和用于RL的STGR-RL-36k，包含精心构建的时间和空间标注。然后采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计了多个专门奖励来共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中，Open-o3 Video实现了最先进的性能，在Qwen2.5-VL基线上将mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在广泛的视频理解基准测试中也观察到一致的改进，包括VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench。

Conclusion: 除了准确性之外，Open-o3 Video生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值的信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，缺乏系统性的颜色精度评估基准。颜色作为人类视觉感知和沟通的基础，在艺术和设计工作流程中至关重要。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建基准测试，包含数值颜色表示，通过感知和自动化评估方法对流行文本到图像模型进行测试。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在颜色生成性能上存在差异，揭示了模型对哪些颜色约定理解最好以及常见的失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench将指导精确颜色生成技术的改进，基准测试将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在面对未见数据时性能会大幅下降，而无监督领域适应可以避免新领域的昂贵标注成本

Method: 在嵌入空间中学习类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且类别间可分离；使用字典存储不同图像的原型，避免类别缺失问题并实现原型对比学习

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的框架能有效提升跨模态分割性能

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建，提供全面而紧凑的物体覆盖，在计算效率和重建质量方面表现出色。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory

Motivation: 长视频理解面临计算复杂、内容分散的挑战，现有方法忽略时序依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整且查询相关的上下文。

Method: 提出训练无关、模型无关的SeViCES框架，包含SVCFS模块（时序感知语义分支+聚类引导视觉分支）和ACR模块（证据融合和答案空间约束）。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架能有效提升长视频理解性能。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

TL;DR: 提出UltraHR-100K超高清文本到图像数据集和频率感知后训练方法，解决超高清图像生成中数据集缺失和细节合成策略不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超高清文本到图像生成面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量超高清数据集，以及缺乏针对超高清场景下细粒度细节合成的专门训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集，包含10万张分辨率超过3K的高质量图像；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)，利用离散傅里叶变换约束频率分量以保留高频细节。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集和专门的后训练策略，有效解决了超高清文本到图像生成中的关键挑战，显著提升了生成图像的细节质量。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术来减少多比特量化网络的训练开销：权重偏置校正和位级核心集采样策略，在保持模型性能的同时将训练时间减少高达7.88倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多比特量化方法需要为每个支持的位宽重复完整数据集更新，训练成本随精度数量线性增长，且需要额外微调阶段，导致显著的训练开销。

Method: 使用权重偏置校正实现共享批归一化并消除微调需求；采用位级核心集采样策略，让每个子模型在基于梯度重要性分数选择的紧凑信息子集上训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的准确率的同时，将训练时间减少高达7.88倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了多比特量化网络的训练开销，同时保持了模型性能，为灵活部署深度神经网络提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种新颖的KV缓存压缩方法，通过混合重要性和多样性来优化大型视觉语言模型中的KV缓存压缩，解决了多模态KV缓存中的语义冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，这限制了部署可扩展性。

Method: MixKV方法分析KV缓存在不同注意力头中的冗余程度，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来选择压缩的KV对，而不是仅依赖重要性标准。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV在五个多模态理解基准上平均提升基线方法5.1%，在GUI基础任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别获得8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过混合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩问题，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存占用，并可无缝扩展到LLMs中。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决长时序驾驶场景生成中的几何一致性问题，现有方法在长距离场景中难以保持几何一致性。

Method: 1) 在共享潜在空间中联合处理图像和深度；2) 显式条件化先前生成关键帧的几何信息；3) 使用扭曲一致引导控制采样过程；4) 视频扩散模型插值生成密集帧。

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值方法，显著提升了长时序驾驶场景生成的质量和几何一致性。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 扩散变换器在超高分辨率训练成本极高，因为自注意力机制随图像token数量呈二次方增长

Method: 利用扩散过程的光谱进展特性，在每一步动态调整位置编码的频率谱，使其与当前生成阶段匹配

Result: 能够生成远超训练分辨率的图像（如使用FLUX生成1600万像素），在多个基准测试中实现最先进的保真度

Conclusion: DyPE在超高分辨率图像生成中表现出色，尤其在高分辨率下优势更加明显

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个术语存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow框架，统一轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用普通DiT骨干网络取得了FID 2.58(1-NFE)和2.15(2-NFE)的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦冲突目标实现了更好的收敛性能，证明了该框架在少步生成建模中的有效性。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Conclusion: Cupid通过将3D重建构建为条件采样过程，在统一的生成框架下实现了从单张图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理的能力，在定量和定性评估中均表现出色。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Method: 开发雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线标定简化传感器集成；使用雷达和相机数据的共同特征准确推导检测对象的真实世界位置；采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查来超越单纯位置匹配的限制。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像分割集成到多模态大语言模型时，通常使用边界点表示或专用分割头，这些方法依赖离散表示或语义提示输入任务特定解码器，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 提出基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉标记，通过通用VQ-VAE将其解码为图像，使分割完全依赖于MLLM的像素级理解。采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成所需视觉标记以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过自回归生成范式成功统一了多模态理解和像素级感知，为图像分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability

### [80] [Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20812)
*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型，在无需训练的情况下解决密集型信息图像的理解难题，实现错误校正和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在密集型信息图像理解方面存在困难，主要挑战在于精确定位密集布局中的关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 采用训练免费的推测解码框架，包含草稿阶段（小型VLMs生成多样化定位候选）和裁决阶段（强VLM综合路径生成最终答案），并引入共识专家选择机制提高效率。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等挑战性基准测试中取得一致性能提升，相比大型专有模型或训练流程实现错误校正和成本效益。

Conclusion: SV框架通过综合多个部分准确推理路径的正确见解，在密集型信息和高分辨率视觉问答任务中实现了高效准确的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

### [81] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一个基于物理引导的自监督高光谱超分辨率框架，通过解混瓶颈和线性混合重建光谱，在单波段MSI下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时容易失败。

Method: 从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线，与监督基线相比也很有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI下也保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LDDBM（潜在去噪扩散桥模型），这是一个基于潜在变量扩展的通用模态转换框架，能够在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态之间的桥接，无需对齐维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面仍面临挑战。现有方法存在维度共享、高斯先验和模态特定架构等限制性假设，限制了其通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中操作，引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，并提出预测损失指导跨域转换训练。

Result: 该方法支持任意模态对，在多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成等多样化模态转换任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LDDBM为通用模态转换建立了新的强基准，通过综合实验验证了框架的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多主体场景。

Method: 提出分层画布表示（每个主体在独立层）和锁定机制（保持选定层高保真度，其他层灵活适应上下文），无需架构改动，使用位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略。

Result: 实验表明在空间控制和身份保持方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LayerComposer为多主体个性化图像生成提供了优越的空间控制和身份保持能力。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，通过整体生成整个场景来解决现有模型在创建连贯多镜头叙事方面的不足，实现了从剪辑合成到自动化电影制作的关键转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的"叙事差距"，这些模型擅长生成孤立片段但无法创建具有全局一致性的故事叙述。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，以及稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏），确保分钟级生成效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: HoloCine标志着从剪辑合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于配置依赖的机器人运动学校准框架，使用局部POE模型和傅里叶基函数插值，显著提高工业机器人的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人精确运动学对于工具精确定位至关重要，但非几何因素会引入配置依赖的模型差异，需要改进整个工作空间的精度。

Method: 在多个配置下识别局部POE模型，使用肩部和肘部关节角度参数化的傅里叶基函数进行插值，构建全局模型。

Result: 在两个6自由度工业机器人上验证，最大定位误差减少超过50%，达到亚毫米级精度要求，训练效率远高于神经网络方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理配置依赖的运动学误差，特别适用于具有较大配置差异的机器人，在双机器人协作任务中展示了实用性和可重复性。

Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in
articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce
configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a
configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy
across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,
selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple
configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity
load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized
by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural
network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training
efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed
approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the
sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with
larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot
collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and
repeatability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非抓取式操作中物体物理属性未知和接触丰富交互复杂性的核心挑战，扩展接触隐式MPC在多样化物体几何形状和多物体场景中的应用能力。

Method: 开发了Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+)算法，集成了物体扫描、网格重建和硬件执行的完整流程，相比前代C3显著提高了求解速度。

Conclusion: C3+算法实现了实时性能的多物体推动任务，展示了接触隐式MPC在复杂非抓取操作场景中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in
robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of
contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive
control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory
optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly,
yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this
work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar
pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object
domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and
object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the
environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To
achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an
enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object
scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its
predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling
real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our
system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals
within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6,
3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机竞速方法受限于预设轨迹，缺乏在任意状态间飞行的泛化能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用点质量模型轨迹作为代理奖励，近似最优飞行目标，并采用课程学习来高效训练和实现泛化。

Result: 仿真实验显示优于非线性模型预测控制方法，真实环境测试证明策略在小型ARM单板计算机上的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该强化学习框架成功实现了无人机任意状态间的最小时间飞行策略，具有良好的泛化性和实际部署能力。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time
flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal
states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional
approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds
and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting
real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time
planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our
approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to
approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning
to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We
validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories
and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning.
Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in
outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a
small ARM-based single-board computer.

Motivation: 6-DOF并联运动学机器人在精密应用中需要微纳级运动控制，因此精确校准至关重要。传统正向运动学校准方法复杂，而逆运动学方法能更有效地完成校准任务。

Method: 通过文献综述分析三种主要校准方法：外部仪器校准、约束校准和自校准，重点关注逆运动学基础的校准技术。

Result: 研究发现研究人员主要关注提高平台位置和方向精度，考虑单一或多重误差源，主要处理结构误差，部分考虑环境因素，但都在无负载条件下进行校准。

Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been
extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control
characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in
versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines,
space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc.
All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require
micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this
challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is
essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based,
constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used
for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key
methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse
kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that
the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and
orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases,
environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done
under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of
the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further
exploration in a specific area.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates
free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an
object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used
methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the
consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade
machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a
machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.
Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source
platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for
research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test
bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create
a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so
that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers
closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and
monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform
is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a
geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through
photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable
geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel
mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric
reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as
implemented on this platform.

Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence
models that ignore motion structure often yield invalid or inefficient
executions. We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with
a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding,
enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task
graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20%
validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise
accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of
paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6
with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick
success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60
language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions
via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that
path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate,
reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning
and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for
general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing
locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A
physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is
incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,
and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable
reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait
on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to
vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic
adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a
high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from
detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model
predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller
maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware
experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling
on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and
incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning
with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for
magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is
inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching
a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above
a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on
contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around
obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural
priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be
exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We
present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for
manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural
priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework
comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and
localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle
filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module
that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map
of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned
predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact
localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths
that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating
feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world
on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve
under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object
from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these
tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to
baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation
maintenance problem.

TL;DR: Kinaema模型通过隐式潜在记忆处理视觉观察流，能够在大型场景中预测查询图像相对于当前位置的相对位置，无需显式存储观察历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在连续操作中利用先前观察信息来优化效率的问题，特别是在大型场景中定位自身位置的需求。

Method: 使用基于transformer的循环模型维护隐式潜在记忆，压缩传感器读数历史为紧凑表示，避免显式存储观察历史。

Result: 模型在Mem-Nav任务中表现出色，能够导航到实际情节开始前观察到的目标，计算效率优于传统基于观察历史注意力的transformer。

Conclusion: Kinaema模型通过隐式记忆机制有效解决了大型场景中的定位问题，为连续机器人操作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出MemER分层策略框架，让机器人策略具备记忆能力，通过高层策略选择相关历史关键帧，结合最近帧生成指令给底层策略执行，在需要长时间记忆的机器人操作任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类依赖记忆完成任务，但大多数机器人策略缺乏这种能力。直接使用长观察历史计算昂贵且在协变量偏移下脆弱，而无差别采样历史会导致信息冗余或无关。

Method: 分层策略框架：高层策略训练选择并跟踪历史相关关键帧，使用选定关键帧和最近帧为底层VLA模型生成文本指令。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct和π0.5分别作为高层和底层策略进行微调。

Result: MemER在三个需要分钟级记忆的真实世界长视野机器人操作任务中优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有VLA模型，能高效推理长视野依赖关系，成功赋予机器人策略记忆能力。

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies
lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same
ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally
expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling
of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a
hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select
and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level
policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text
instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with
existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to
efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we
finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level
policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language
annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world
long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory. Videos

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP)方法，结合视觉基础模型和扩散规划，实现领域无关的自主泊车，在分布偏移下保持90%以上的泊车成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端方法在领域偏移（如天气和光照变化）下的鲁棒性问题，不依赖额外数据实现跨域泛化。

Method: 集成视觉基础模型与基于扩散的运动规划，在CARLA中训练并在对抗性设置下进行零样本迁移。

Result: 在所有测试的分布外场景中泊车成功率超过90%，在3D高斯溅射重建的真实泊车环境中显示出有前景的仿真到真实迁移能力。

Conclusion: DDP通过视觉基础模型和扩散规划的组合，显著提升了自主泊车在跨域场景下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模块化可重构机器人适合特定空间任务，但形态组合爆炸阻碍了统一控制。

Method: 分散式强化学习方案：轮式模块使用SAC进行运动控制，7自由度肢体使用PPO进行转向和操作控制。

Result: 仿真中转向策略平均绝对误差3.63度，操作策略成功率84.6%，轮式策略扭矩降低95.4%；月球模拟现场测试验证了零样本集成。

Conclusion: 系统在不同策略执行模式间平滑切换，无空闲状态或控制冲突，为模块化月球机器人提供了可扩展、可重用且稳健的方法。

Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the
combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a
decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns
its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and
7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and
manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In
simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg}
between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 %
success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor
torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success.
Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous
locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system
transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for
Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a
scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

TL;DR: NeuralTouch是一个结合视觉描述符场(NDF)和触觉传感的多模态框架，通过轻柔物理交互实现精确、可泛化的抓取


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NDF单独使用时由于相机标定不完美、点云不完整和物体变化性会产生不准确的抓取姿态，而现有触觉方法通常局限于简单的预定义接触几何

Method: 利用NDF隐式表示目标接触几何，训练基于神经描述符的深度强化学习策略，使用触觉反馈来优化抓取

Result: 在模拟和真实世界的零样本迁移任务中显著提高了抓取准确性和鲁棒性，无需额外微调

Conclusion: NeuralTouch为精确、接触丰富的机器人操作提供了一个通用框架

Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: PointMapPolicy是一种新颖的扩散策略方法，通过在结构化点网格上调节而不进行下采样，结合点云和RGB数据实现增强的多模态感知，在机器人操作任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前点云方法难以捕捉细粒度细节，而RGB方法缺乏几何感知能力，限制了机器人操作系统的精度和泛化能力。需要结合两种感知模态的优势。

Method: 提出PointMapPolicy方法，在结构化点网格上调节扩散策略而不下采样，使用xLSTM作为骨干网络有效融合点图和RGB数据，可直接将计算机视觉技术应用于3D数据。

Result: 在RoboCasa和CALVIN基准测试以及真实机器人评估中，该方法在多样化操作任务上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: PointMapPolicy通过结合点云和RGB数据的优势，有效提升了机器人操作系统的感知能力和任务执行性能。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities,
where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture
detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context.
Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially
for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders
their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel
approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points
without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape
and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between
reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the
use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM
as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for
enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa
and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MR-UBi通过视觉和触觉反馈集成实现了更稳定、准确和用户友好的水下机械臂遥操作

Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system
with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction
torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the
MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during
underwater robot arm teleoperation. User studies with sixteen participants
compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly
improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the
optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range
during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness.
Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload
(NASA--TLX). Overall, the results confirm that \textit{MR-UBi} enables more

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效规划工作空间坐标系中的轨迹，特别适用于移动零件比移动工具更容易的加工场景，通过B样条保证了轨迹的连续性和平滑性。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace
coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into
account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is
easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical
description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a
design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines.
The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree,
which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot
trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the
TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an
industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

Abstract: Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

Motivation: 解决机器人操作任务在未知动力学下的控制问题，特别是在负载不确定的抓取任务中，需要主动探索和在线参数适应来实现精确的基于模型的控制。

Method: 将问题构建为双重控制问题，预定义包含显式适应机制的反馈策略结构，提出两种参考轨迹生成方法：一种在鲁棒最优控制中嵌入参数不确定性，另一种最小化最优性损失来衡量参数相关信息对任务性能的敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出的双重控制方法能够有效处理未知动力学系统的控制问题，通过结合参数适应和任务执行优化，在抓取任务中实现了更好的性能和系统辨识能力。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
results confirm the validity of this approach.

Conclusion: 所提出的最大化路径速度方法有效解决了时间最优路径跟踪中的奇异性问题，实现了高效平滑轨迹规划。

Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are
addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which
inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

Conclusion: RubbleSim为研究空隙空间探索提供了可行的替代方案，克服了真实数据获取的障碍。

Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are

the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation
benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object
categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned
knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual
navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path
anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns
multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure
representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features
within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive
sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby
reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments
across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared
to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering
memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at
https://bigtree765.github.io/C-Nav-project.

TL;DR: 提出结合MPPI与Dreamer模块的优化框架，在连续步态空间中实时调整四足机器人步态，实现能耗降低36.48%的同时保持精确跟踪和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型无关强化学习收敛到单一步态导致性能次优，以及模型预测控制无法适应多变环境的问题。

Method: 使用模型预测路径积分(MPPI)算法结合Dreamer模块，在每个时间步联合优化动作和步态变量，采用学习奖励函数促进速度跟踪、能效、稳定性和平滑过渡。

Result: 在Unitree Go1仿真中，不同目标速度下能耗平均降低36.48%，同时保持准确跟踪和适应性步态。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了四足机器人的实时步态自适应，在能耗和性能方面均取得显著改进。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

TL;DR: FieldGen是一个场引导的数据生成框架，通过分解操作为预操作和精细操作两阶段，结合人类演示的关键信息和自动生成的多样化轨迹，实现可扩展、多样化且高质量的真实世界数据收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人操作数据收集方法难以平衡规模、多样性和质量。仿真可扩展但存在仿真到现实的差距，遥操作质量高但多样性有限且成本高。

Method: 将操作分解为预操作阶段（允许轨迹多样性）和精细操作阶段（需要专家精度）。人类演示捕捉关键接触和姿态信息，然后吸引力场自动生成收敛到成功配置的多样化轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，使用FieldGen训练的策略相比遥操作基线实现了更高的成功率和改进的稳定性，同时显著减少了长期真实世界数据收集的人力投入。

Conclusion: FieldGen通过解耦设计结合了可扩展的轨迹多样性和精确监督，为机器人操作提供了高效的数据收集解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic
manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance
scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided
data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality
real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory
diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments
generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.
Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher
success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines,
while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data
collection. Webpage is available at https://fieldgen.github.io/.

Motivation: 机器学习推动了机器人导航、运动和操作等领域的重大进展，但模拟环境与现实世界之间存在现实差距，这严重阻碍了系统从模拟到现实的成功转移。缩小这一差距是机器人学中最紧迫的挑战之一。

Method: 通过调查分析，本文总结了多种克服现实差距的技术，包括领域随机化、现实到模拟转移、状态和动作抽象、模拟-现实协同训练等方法。

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In
this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape,
highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap
and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual
reinforcement learning. Website: https://3dgsworld.github.io/.

Motivation: 解决机器人导航中学习策略需要同时适应多样化环境和特定机器人物理约束的挑战，实现跨不同机器人平台的可泛化导航。

Method: 采用分层架构：通用规划器从多样化开放世界数据中学习语义规划，专门化仿射模型在低成本模拟中学习机器人物理约束和能力，通过图像空间路径提案和重新排序实现解耦。

Result: 在真实世界实验中，VAMOS在室内和复杂室外导航中比最先进的基于模型和端到端学习方法获得更高的成功率，支持跨轮式和腿式机器人的导航，通过拒绝物理不可行计划使单机器人可靠性提高3倍。

Conclusion: 分层设计实现了语义规划与具体机器人物理约束的有效解耦，使单一高级规划器可部署到物理特性不同的机器人上，显著提升了导航可靠性和跨平台适应性。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:

### [113] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全依赖自注意力层，而SSM层对此无补偿机制。仅保留15%注意力头即可维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能专门化程度，特别是自注意力层在检索任务中的关键作用。

Method: 通过注意力消融实验，在RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型上测试检索性能，并分析稀疏化注意力对性能的影响。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索完全失败（0%准确率），而仅保留15%注意力头即可维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时MMLU性能保留84%。

Conclusion: 混合架构中存在严格的功能专门化，自注意力层专门负责检索任务，这些模型更像是专门化模块而非集成系统，对架构优化和可解释性有重要启示。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

TL;DR: NAS-DQN通过在线神经架构搜索实现动态网络重构，在深度强化学习中超越静态架构设计，获得更优的性能、样本效率和策略稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的神经网络架构通常通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定并固定，限制了性能提升。本研究探索在线自适应架构优化是否能突破这一限制。

Method: 引入NAS-DQN代理，将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在连续控制任务中优于三个固定架构基线和随机搜索控制，实现了更优的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅有益，而且是在线深度强化学习中实现最优样本效率的必要条件，RL代理的设计可以无缝集成为学习过程的动态组成部分。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练、基于检索增强生成的框架，通过将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将LLM级推理能力转移到小型模型上，使SLMs在CUDA代码生成任务中接近LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用LLM生成优化CUDA代码面临两大挑战：云API存在代码泄露风险，本地部署计算成本高且效率低。虽然SLMs更轻量且隐私友好，但其有限的推理能力在复杂CUDA生成任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出ReGraphT框架：将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。还建立了按推理复杂度分级的CUDA特定基准。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval上平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC特定微调模型和其他检索增强方法。与DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct和Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct配对时，SLMs能接近LLM级性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT成功将LLM级推理能力转移到SLMs上，使小型模型在CUDA代码生成任务中达到接近LLM的性能，同时避免了隐私风险和过高计算开销。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Motivation: 传统交通分配问题的数学规划方法在大规模网络中计算复杂度呈非线性增长，计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，特别是Transformer架构，直接从数据中学习预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对之间的复杂相关性。

Result: 在多个测试网络上验证，模型比传统优化方法快几个数量级，能有效估计多类别网络中的路径级交通流量，提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的数据驱动方法为交通分配问题提供了高效、灵活且准确的解决方案，支持交通管理和快速情景分析。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现优异，但在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，对少数群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，采用基于表征、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性权重调整优势函数。当缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在涵盖5种临床模态的7个数据集上，FairGRPO相比所有基线方法减少预测差异27.2%，同时提高F1分数12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，基于该方法发布的FairMedGemma-4B模型在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了跨人口群体的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER在何种情况下优于现有方法、其失效模式和其他局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

TL;DR: 首次分析了Muon优化器中非精确正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化oracle框架下引入加性误差模型，分析非精确正交化更新的性能界限，量化近似误差对性能的影响。

Result: 发现近似精度与最优步长和动量参数存在耦合：较低精度需要较小步长但较大动量，近似过程成为需要与学习率共同调优的关键参数。

Conclusion: 将近似过程从实现细节提升为关键调优参数，NanoGPT实验验证了预测的耦合关系，最优学习率随近似精度变化而明显偏移。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision

*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化难题，提出了两种基于f-差分隐私的隐私计算方法：PN-f-DP和Sec-f-LDP，能够更准确地量化隐私泄露并实现更优的效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习允许用户协作而无需向中央服务器共享数据，但由于复杂的算法组件（如去中心化通信和本地更新），准确量化隐私预算具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了两种新的f-DP隐私计算方法：PN-f-DP（量化随机游走通信下用户对间的隐私泄露）和Sec-f-LDP（通过共享秘密支持结构化噪声注入），结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中性工具。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比基于Rényi DP的方法，本文方法能产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私计算中具有优势，能够捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关噪声带来的隐私放大效应。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

*Matan Tsipory,Ran Levinstein,Itay Evron,Mark Kong,Deanna Needell,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了线性回归持续学习中的任务排序策略，特别关注贪心最大化任务间差异性的排序方法，并与随机排序进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务排序对持续学习性能的影响，特别是贪心排序策略在理论和实践中的表现，解决现有文献中关于此类排序策略的开放性问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法理论工具，形式化贪心排序策略，开发几何和代数直觉，并在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证分析。

Result: 实证显示贪心排序比随机排序收敛更快；理论上，在高秩回归设置中贪心排序与随机排序有相似损失界，但在一般秩设置中，单次贪心排序可能失败，而允许重复的贪心排序以O(1/∛k)速率收敛。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪心和随机排序策略之间的细微差别，贪心排序在特定条件下表现优越，但需要谨慎处理重复策略以避免灾难性失败。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的椭圆不确定性集合方法，用于解决强化学习在金融市场中训练与部署环境不匹配的问题，特别是针对市场影响的定向特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在金融应用中存在训练与部署环境不匹配的问题：训练时基于历史数据，部署时交易行为会影响市场价格（市场影响），而传统的鲁棒强化学习方法依赖对称结构，无法捕捉市场影响的定向特性。

Method: 开发了一类新颖的椭圆不确定性集合，建立了最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，实现了高效可处理的鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法获得了更高的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的强化学习提供了一个更忠实且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法存在梯度估计偏差问题，除非扰动步长趋近于零，这限制了优化性能。

Method: 通过将方向导数重新表述为伸缩级数，并从精心设计的分布中采样，构建了无偏梯度估计器，分析了四种具体构造的理论性质。

Conclusion: 成功克服了零阶优化中的偏差问题，提供了一族有效且理论保证的无偏梯度估计器。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋近于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非保持固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，并在理论和实验上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与梯度方向对齐的潜在优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动是否能提供更准确的梯度估计。

Method: 将问题建模为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案能自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。同时扩展了使用δ-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降收敛性分析。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案在特定条件下优于传统方法。在合成问题和实际任务上的实证评估验证了DAPs的性能优势。

Conclusion: 方向对齐扰动方案能够有效提升零阶梯度估计的精度，特别是在关键方向上，为随机扰动方法提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声，忽略了数据维度的异质性，限制了认证防御效果

Method: 将现有随机平滑方法从对称噪声扩展到非对称噪声分布，开发噪声参数生成器优化各维度噪声参数

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，在大认证半径下认证精度提升高达182.6%

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了认证对抗鲁棒性的效果，为随机平滑方法提供了通用增强框架

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了时间序列预测中的"长序列信息增益假设"，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，并提出AMRC方法通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但该研究表明现有模型在训练中学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），反而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度时间片段来指导梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC有效抑制冗余特征学习，同时显著提高模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时间建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

TL;DR: 本文提出推理即填充方法，利用掩码扩散语言模型填充推理模板来结构化输出，并开发多令牌熵解码算法，在保持性能的同时减少解码步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型在数学和编程任务中，任意顺序解码算法表现不佳，标准多令牌解码会显著降低性能。需要证明MDLMs额外计算成本的合理性。

Method: 1. 推理即填充：使用MDLMs填充推理模板，区分推理和答案令牌；2. 多令牌熵解码：基于条件熵的自适应采样器，减少并行解码误差。

Result: 在GSM8k上，使用后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base获得与人工编写推理轨迹相当的性能提升；MED算法在保持性能的同时减少2.7倍解码步骤。

Conclusion: MDLMs的训练和计算为推理和后训练方法开辟了新途径，证明了其额外计算成本的合理性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

TL;DR: 使用监督学习和决策树分类在CAD建模的平面图中进行RFID位置推断，旨在解决国防资产存储中的安全挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID跟踪是国防资产存储的可行方案，但传感器特异性差（易受远程检测、欺骗和伪造攻击）会导致错误检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 采用监督学习模拟，使用真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类，在CAD建模的平面图中对12个实验室区域进行分类，处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可在现实模拟中应用于区域级异常检测或错位监控，通过改进天线布局或增加传感器融合可提升低覆盖区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮任务中表现出色，但在复杂多步任务中面临挑战。基于群体的强化学习算法仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，会导致训练不稳定和次优策略。

Method: SALT框架从相同提示的轨迹构建图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势，作为即插即用模块与现有基于群体的RL算法集成。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型大小下持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了基于群体RL算法的训练稳定性问题，且计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Result: 使用2021-2025年74种资产的1462个日度数据，发现显著的格兰杰因果关系和中等样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 核心加密资产的流动性和波动率代理确实产生溢出效应，能够预测市场风险，为风险管理提供有用信息。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

TL;DR: CTAE是一个耦合Transformer自编码器，用于从多脑区同时记录中分离共享和区域特定的神经动态，能更好地解码行为变量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构，要么局限于单脑区、线性读出的假设，无法有效分离共享和区域特定的神经信号。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和解码器捕捉长程神经动态，将每个区域的潜空间显式划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集上，CTAE提取的表征比现有方法更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE能有效处理非平稳、非线性动态，并分离共享与区域特定结构，为多脑区神经记录分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过形状片段分割和Shapley值评估来识别关键形状片段，提高解释的精确性和因果保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有后验解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，忽略了分类结果主要由关键形状片段驱动的基本前提。

Method: ShapeX框架包含形状片段描述与检测(SDD)框架，能够学习对分类至关重要的多样化形状片段，然后使用Shapley值评估这些片段的显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精确性和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过关注形状片段而非单个时间步，能够生成揭示因果关系而非仅仅相关性的解释，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类提供了更可靠的透明度。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

TL;DR: 提出基于MentalRoBERTa的分层双头神经网络，用于社交媒体自杀风险四分类（指标、意念、行为、尝试），结合CORAL序数预测头和标准分类头，解决类别不平衡和时间依赖性问题。

Motivation: 社交媒体成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临类别严重不平衡、发布模式的时间复杂性以及风险级别兼具序数和分类双重性质的挑战。

Method: 使用分层双头神经网络：CORAL头保持风险级别间的序数关系，标准分类头实现灵活分类；3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖，显式时间间隔嵌入捕捉发布行为动态；结合CORAL损失、交叉熵和Focal Loss的混合损失函数；冻结MentalRoBERTa前6层并使用混合精度训练。

Result: 使用5折分层交叉验证评估，以宏F1分数为主要指标。

Conclusion: 该模型能够同时处理自杀风险分类中的序数关系保持、类别不平衡和时间依赖性等关键挑战。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线方法竞争，实现理论保证与可扩展性的统一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论与实践的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等算法经验性能强但缺乏有限样本保证，而理论方法无法扩展到大规模问题

Method: 采用博弈论强化学习框架，DDQN智能体与GES或GraN-DAG基线竞争，始终从对手解进行热启动，确保学习到的图不会比对手差

Result: 在合成SEMs（30节点）上，观察到的错误概率随样本量n衰减，与理论紧密匹配；在真实世界基准测试中持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，可扩展到Hepar2（70节点）、Dream（100节点）和Andes（220节点）等大规模图

Conclusion: 建立了同时具备可证明一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，统一了经验性能与严格有限样本理论

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，传统的欧氏距离存在诸多问题，需要更有效的距离度量和维度加权方法来提高分类准确性。

Method: 开发了新的维度加权方案，将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节包含k个参考样本的区域形状和大小。

Result: 在基因表达数据集上，相比传统KNN获得了约10%的分类准确率提升，在各种交叉验证实验中表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法是对传统KNN分类器的重要泛化，特别适用于样本数量有限但维度较高的数据集。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型崩溃问题，通过分离原型和编码器的优化目标，使用在线EM风格过程更新原型，无需显式正则化即可获得多样化的原型和更好的下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型崩溃问题，即多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样化目标来指导编码器学习丰富表示的核心目的。现有方法通过过参数化原型集或添加临时正则化来缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在不同目标下分别学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程独立于编码器损失进行更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型崩溃，无需显式正则化即可获得持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型自监督学习中的根本问题，提供了一种更有效的训练策略。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前时间序列基础模型表现不佳，原因在于盲目套用NLP/CV范式。时间序列数据缺乏概念密度，需要基于不变性原理构建系统化数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）表现不如轻量监督基线和经典模型，这是因为简单套用NLP或CV的流水线方法不适用于时间序列数据的特点。

Method: 建议从机会性聚合转向原则性设计：构建能够系统覆盖保持时间语义不变性空间的数据集，基于第一原理构建时间序列不变性本体。

Result: 通过确保不变性覆盖来实现表征完整性，时间序列基础模型才能获得必要的对齐结构。

Conclusion: 只有通过不变性覆盖确保表征完整性，TSFMs才能实现泛化、推理和真正涌现行为所需的对齐结构。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型揭示了阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白传播的结构连接和功能连接相互作用机制，发现SC和FC在不同脑区对tau传播的贡献具有区域性不对称性，且这种主导地位随疾病进展而变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累的证据表明大规模网络架构在阿尔茨海默病进展中起关键作用，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用，并在独立AD队列中验证发现。

Result: FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域作用更大。SC和FC的相对主导地位随疾病进展变化，早期AD中FC占主导，后期SC变为主因。SC和FC主导区域的空间模式与AD相关基因表达高度一致。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau传播中具有区域性不对称贡献，其相对主导地位随疾病阶段变化，且与AD相关基因表达模式密切相关，非可改变风险因素通过区域特异性方式重塑tau传播路径。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定方差噪声方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 使用逐步衰减调度动态调整噪声方差和学习率，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，结合去中心化推送-求和聚合技术。

Result: 理论分析证明ADP-VRSGP具有鲁棒收敛性，实验结果显示在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP有效解决了隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，在保证隐私的同时显著提升了训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在处理大规模TSP时面临内存限制、初始解质量不高和搜索空间导航不足等挑战。

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图将TSP实例划分为簇并抽象为超节点，生成超路径来指导初始化和优化过程，减少搜索空间。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理更大规模实例时，显著缩小了与最优解的差距。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超路径引导的邻域搜索，为大规模TSP问题提供了更高效和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RLVR虽然能有效训练模型，但忽视了不同任务的重要性差异，需要将人类价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中。

Method: RLEV扩展了RLVR框架，在奖励函数中直接融入人类定义的价值信号，使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，并通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV在多种RL算法和模型规模下均优于仅基于正确性的基线方法，不仅能提高价值加权准确率，还能学习到价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁回应，对高价值提示详尽回应。

Conclusion: RLEV通过优化明确的效用函数，为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了一条实用路径，即使在噪声价值信号下也保持稳健。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习解决方案，具有良好的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单任务（如阈值学习）中不可能实现，本文旨在探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：在固定输入上保持一致；(2)近似可复制性：对分布中大部分样本分类一致；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 对于常数可复制性参数，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：(1)和(2)使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，(3)需要Θ(d²/α²)标记样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的筛查工具面临挑战，常规实验室数据成本低但存在生物标志物非特异性和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 系统比较了126种分析流程，包括机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，使用患者级数据分区防止泄漏。

Result: 最佳模型（逻辑回归分类器）显示中等排序能力（AUROC=0.815）但临床分类性能差（F1-score=0.25），高阴性预测值（0.98）但召回率不足（0.79）。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中的癌症信号太弱且易混淆，无法可靠区分正常衰老或其他炎症状况，需要整合多模态数据源才能取得有意义的进展。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

TL;DR: CO-PFL是一种面向贡献的个性化联邦学习算法，通过动态评估客户端贡献来优化全局聚合，解决了传统联邦学习在数据异构性下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异构和稀缺的情况下表现不佳，其基于数据量的启发式聚合方法无法准确评估客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优的个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差来联合评估客户端贡献，利用梯度和数据子空间信息进行双子空间分析，为每个客户端提供原则性的聚合权重。同时整合参数级个性化机制和掩码感知动量优化。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR10C、CINIC10和Mini-ImageNet四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化精度、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL有效减轻了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调，通过构建具有稳定更新的定制子模型来提升本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

*Iván Ojeda-Ruiz,Young Ju-Lee,Malcolm Dickens,Leonardo Cambisaca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Fair-SMW算法，通过拉格朗日方法和Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury恒等式重新表述约束优化问题，提高了谱聚类算法的效率，在保持公平性的同时显著减少了计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱聚类算法在纳入群体公平性（平衡）约束时计算效率较低，需要改进其计算性能。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新表述约束优化问题，提出了Fair-SMW算法，采用三种具有不同谱间隙的拉普拉斯矩阵变体。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上的评估显示，计算时间比现有最优方法快两倍，同时能够实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平聚类质量的同时，显著提高了计算效率，为公平谱聚类提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Motivation: 现实世界时序预测任务中，类别信息对于捕捉数据内在模式至关重要，但传统注意力机制未能充分利用此类信息。

Method: 扩展传统QKV注意力框架为QKCV，引入静态类别嵌入C，作为即插即用模块增强各类注意力模型，支持仅更新静态嵌入的高效微调。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上显著提升了Vanilla Transformer、Informer、PatchTST、TFT等模型的预测精度，微调时仅更新静态嵌入即可达到优越性能。

Conclusion: QKCV注意力机制有效利用类别信息提升时序预测性能，同时提供高效微调方案，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: 提出MetaVD方法，通过贝叶斯元学习预测客户端相关的dropout率，解决联邦学习中非IID数据和模型过拟合问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习面临模型过拟合和本地模型发散的问题，特别是在有限和非IID数据环境下

Method: 使用共享超网络学习客户端相关的dropout率，通过条件dropout后验实现元学习的后验适应和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合

Result: 在多个稀疏和非IID联邦学习数据集上，MetaVD表现出优秀的分类准确性和不确定性校准性能，特别是对分布外客户端

Conclusion: MetaVD能有效压缩本地模型参数，减轻模型过拟合并降低通信成本

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse

out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to

better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中max-min准则的收敛性和实用性问题，传统方法在策略更新和全局收敛方面存在挑战。

Method: 将max-min多目标强化学习重构为双人零和正则化连续博弈，采用镜像下降算法简化策略更新并确保全局最后迭代收敛。

Result: 在表格设置中验证了算法的收敛行为，在深度强化学习实现中显著优于先前基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实验上都表现出色，为多目标强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能在不显著增加计算成本的情况下提高图神经网络在分子性质预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子性质最有效的方法，但需要更准确的模型。增加模型复杂度可以提高准确性，但也会增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合（LKM）方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息。

Result: 在三个GNN架构和多个数据集上的评估显示，LKM能将量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差降低高达9.8%（QM9）、45.3%（MD17能量）和22.9%（Chignolin）。

Conclusion: LKM有潜力在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学性质预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过拒绝模型认为不确定的输入来提高可靠性，但很少有方法能达到完美排序预言机的黄金标准性能。本文旨在形式化这种差距并分析其来源。

Method: 将选择性分类差距分解为五个误差来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/偏移引起的松弛。通过合成数据和真实世界基准进行验证实验。

Result: 实验证实：(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会导致显著差距；(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能显著改善评分排序；(iii)数据偏移引入需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助构建更接近理想预言机行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在数据异构性场景下表现有限，缺乏对不同异构场景的鲁棒性。实验发现共享统计信息可以帮助客户端从全局视角更新模型。

Method: FedGPS静态修改客户端学习目标，使用代理信息隐式建模全局数据分布；动态调整本地更新方向，每轮整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 大量实验表明FedGPS在多种异构场景下优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过统计分布和梯度信息的协同整合，有效缓解了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，减少零样本强化学习中数据收集的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为基础模型在零样本强化学习中需要计算大量推理数据的奖励，要么需要奖励函数形式，要么需要大量标注工作。本文旨在通过与环境交互来减少这些数据需求。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策标准，直接建模奖励函数不确定性，引导BFMs进行任务推断的数据收集。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量episode中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为行为基础模型提供了一种高效的任务推断方法，显著减少了数据需求，同时保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个评估LLM代理作弊倾向的基准框架，通过创建任务规范与单元测试直接冲突的"不可能"任务来量化模型作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找"捷径"完成任务，比如删除失败测试而非修复bug，这会破坏基准测试的有效性和实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 通过修改现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）创建不可能任务，测量模型在规范与测试冲突情况下的作弊率。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂操作符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环对作弊率的影响。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench是一个多功能工具，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具，帮助构建更稳健可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中未能显著优于Best-of-N选择，尽管成本更高，表明当前过程奖励模型不可靠且泛化能力差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择在数学推理中很流行，但其线性结构无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质。

Method: 提出自适应算法在难处理的动作空间中最大化过程奖励模型分数，研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能通过探索多个部分解路径来改进数学推理。

Result: 在23个多样化数学问题上，PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无统计显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和波束搜索优于其他PRM方法；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数的更大依赖导致性能不佳，需要在树搜索能有效增强LLM数学推理之前开发不同的奖励建模方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

*Guangyu Dai,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)来解决大-小模型协作中的精度下降、灾难性遗忘和幻觉问题，在保持任务精度的同时显著减少大模型推理调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大-小模型协作框架中存在的显著精度下降、加剧的灾难性遗忘以及小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 采用KAN（Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks）作为协作模型架构，替代传统的MLP，在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中部署KCM协作系统。

Result: 与纯大模型方法相比，使用KCM的协作框架在保持近相同任务精度的同时显著减少大模型推理调用次数，大幅降低计算资源消耗；KAN小模型显著缓解灾难性遗忘，对长尾数据带来显著精度提升；在所有指标上都优于基于MLP的小协作模型(MCM)。

Conclusion: KCM在大-小模型协作中表现出优越性能，既能有效降低计算成本，又能缓解灾难性遗忘问题，为模型协作提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

TL;DR: 提出了ResearchGPT愿景，构建了CS-54k科学问答语料库，包含CS-4k评估基准和CS-50k训练数据集，实验显示通过领域对齐训练的小模型能超越大型专有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能够辅助整个科学研究过程的AI协作系统，需要评估端到端工作流程的基准，而非孤立的子任务。

Method: 从14kCC授权论文构建CS-54k语料库，采用检索增强生成(RAG)和多阶段质量控制，确保事实基础。从中衍生出CS-4k评估基准和CS-50k训练数据集。

Result: CS-4k能够对最先进LLM进行能力分层，在CS-50k上训练的7B规模模型通过监督训练和强化学习显著提升，甚至超越GPT-4.1、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro等大型专有系统。

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好的研究助手更多地依赖于领域对齐的高质量数据训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Motivation: 解决图神经网络在分布偏移下的泛化挑战，避免现有方法需要昂贵环境标注或启发式分割的局限性

Method: 基于因果子图分布变化较小的观察，提出不变分布准则，建立分布偏移与表示范数的定量关系，设计范数引导的不变分布目标函数

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法持续优于最先进的图形泛化方法

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能够有效捕捉因果子图，显著提升图神经网络在分布偏移下的泛化能力

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Motivation: 解决深度学习脑肿瘤分类方法过度依赖数据增强导致泛化能力受限和临床可信度不足的问题，开发无需增强的鲁棒模型。

Method: 使用VGG16和Xception双主干网络结合频率门控注意力块，捕捉互补的局部和全局特征，集成Grad-CAM进行肿瘤区域可视化。

Result: 在7K-DS数据集上4类分类准确率达99.24%，3类和2类分别达98.68%和99.85%；在独立3K-DS数据集上泛化准确率达95.77%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net作为无需增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型，在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvDec混合架构，通过倒置解码器实现时间编码和变量级解码的分离，在保持时间建模能力的同时有效建模变量间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲了时间编码能力。需要一种能同时建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的方法。

Method: 结合基于patch的时间编码器和在变量维度上通过变量级自注意力操作的倒置解码器。引入延迟变量嵌入，在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示；采用自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上验证，高维数据集表现显著提升：Electricity数据集MSE降低20.9%，Weather提升4.3%，Traffic提升2.7%；在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。优势随数据集维度增加而增长。

Conclusion: InvDec通过原则性分离时间编码和变量级解码，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中时间建模和变量依赖建模的平衡问题，特别适用于高维数据集。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界隐私保护需求涉及多个敏感属性且动态变化，现有单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘分为两步：嵌入校准从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息，灵活组合将这些嵌入合并为单一嵌入以保护所有敏感属性。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三种代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架通过理论保证和高效设计成功解决了多属性遗忘的两个关键挑战。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和真实与合成数据的集成，结合定制域适应策略，可以有效提升跑道检测模型在关键应用中的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击且泛化能力差，而强大的LLM评判器虽然泛化能力强但推理成本高，限制了在线RLHF的应用。

Method: 将策略梯度中的优势估计建模为成对偏好分类，实现原则性的不确定性量化，不确定的样本对转发给LLM评判器，确定的样本对由奖励模型评估。

Result: 在奖励模型基准测试中，基于不确定性的路由策略在相同成本下显著优于随机调用评判器，下游对齐结果展示了其在改进在线RLHF中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架能够有效平衡奖励模型和LLM评判器的优势，在保持效率的同时提升强化学习人类反馈的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法获得了更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中考虑协方差矩阵的不确定性是有效的，鲁棒优化框架能够提升层次时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过RBP指标衡量正确token在预测中的排名概率，补充了传统交叉熵指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型的实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出相对排序概率(RBP)指标，量化正确token位于预测前k位的概率，并基于此建立相对排序缩放定律，通过四个数据集和四个模型家族的广泛实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验证明相对排序缩放定律具有鲁棒性和准确性，能够更好地解释涌现现象，并为寻找缩放定律的基础理论提供支持。

Conclusion: 相对排序缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更全面的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程控制需要局部专业化和全局协调，但RL在工业应用中的推广面临奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战，现有学术基准与工业问题差异较大。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个基准，构建顺序回收场景（分类和压制操作），比较模块化架构（专业代理）与集中式代理（全系统控制），分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时，代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后，两种架构性能均大幅提升，性能差距显著缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束起决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱，该基准为工业自动化中多代理RL解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Motivation: 直接对齐算法如DPO使用监督学习而非两阶段RLHF，但当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时会出现设定错误问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 研究DPO的统计估计问题，分析两阶段RLHF的局部行为，提出AuxDPO方法在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量。

Result: 在示例赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务中，AuxDPO表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO能够以原则性方式缓解DPO的设定错误问题，提高对齐算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡的问题，其中一些标记频繁出现而其他标记罕见，这对下一个事件的预测性能（特别是稀有标记事件）构成了重大挑战。

Method: 提出阈值方法，学习阈值来调整由标记先验概率归一化的标记概率以优化标记预测；开发新的神经MTPP模型支持有效时间采样和标记概率估计，无需计算昂贵的数值非正常积分；采用先预测标记再预测时间的策略。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过阈值调整和新的神经MTPP模型有效解决了标记分布不平衡问题，显著提升了稀有标记事件的预测性能。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

### [177] [An Empirical Study of Sample Selection Strategies for Large Language Model Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20428)
*Xuran Li,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM修复中的样本优先级策略，提出了SAPS方法，在毒性降低、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，相比其他方法用更少数据获得相当或更好的修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在现实系统中部署时会产生有害或有偏见的输出，而参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性地使用修复数据，但现有数据选择方法在大型生成模型的行为修复中的效果尚不明确。

Method: 评估了五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、梯度范数选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)以及提出的语义感知优先级采样(SAPS)。通过毒性降低、困惑度和三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率方面达到最佳平衡，用更少数据获得相当或更好的修复效果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效，而高开销方法如CCS和GraNd收益有限。最佳数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法。

Conclusion: 基于选择的修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式，样本选择应被视为修复流程中的可调组件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出可解释基准测试新范式，使用PruneCEL概念学习方法为知识图谱问答系统性能自动生成解释，在F1分数上优于现有方法0.55分，用户研究表明80%情况下参与者能基于解释准确预测系统行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试仅用少量指标总结系统性能，分析评估细节和获取洞察需要繁琐的人工工作且结果常有偏差，因此需要自动生成系统性能解释的新基准测试方法。

Method: 提出可解释基准测试范式，使用专为大型知识图谱设计的PruneCEL概念学习方法计算解释，首次在知识图谱问答系统上实例化该范式。

Result: PruneCEL在可解释基准测试任务上比现有最优概念学习方法F1分数高0.55分；41人参与的用户研究显示80%情况下多数参与者能基于解释准确预测系统行为。

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

TL;DR: MolBridge是一个基于原子级联合图精炼框架的药物相互作用预测模型，通过构建药物对的联合图来直接建模分子间关联，解决了现有方法无法显式建模原子级跨分子交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物相互作用预测方法依赖孤立的药物表示，无法显式建模原子级跨分子交互，限制了在不同分子复杂度和DDI类型分布下的有效性。

Method: 构建药物对的联合图整合原子结构，引入结构一致性模块迭代精炼节点特征同时保持全局结构上下文，有效学习局部和全局交互模式。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MolBridge在长尾和归纳场景下均优于现有最先进基线，实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度图精炼方法显著提高了DDI事件预测的准确性、鲁棒性和机制可解释性，为药物相互作用网络挖掘和分析提供了有效的图基方法。

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种图神经网络方法，通过时间有向图显式建模网球比赛中的不可传递关系，发现在高不可传递复杂度的比赛中博彩公司处理不佳，利用该模型在选择性投注中获得了3.26%的正回报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网球比赛中普遍存在不可传递的玩家优势关系（A胜B、B胜C但C胜A），但现有预测方法很少尝试将其纳入考虑。

Method: 使用图神经网络方法，将球员作为节点，历史比赛结果作为有向边，通过时间有向图显式建模不可传递关系。

Result: 模型在高不可传递性比赛中达到65.7%的准确率和0.215的Brier分数，在1903次投注中使用凯利策略获得了3.26%的正回报率。

Conclusion: 博彩市场在处理不可传递性比赛时存在效率不足，图神经网络方法能够成功捕捉这些关系动态并从中获利。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对后处理图像水印的伪造攻击方法，通过训练偏好模型来检测水印，并使用反向传播优化技术实现水印的移除和伪造，仅需单张水印图像且无需水印模型知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型普及和法律压力增加，数字内容水印技术日益重要。虽然已有许多研究评估水印的抗移除攻击能力，但水印伪造（从真实内容窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 1. 引入偏好模型评估图像是否含水印，使用排序损失在纯程序生成图像上训练，无需真实水印；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像实现水印移除和伪造，仅需单张水印图像且无需水印模型知识。

Result: 在多种后处理图像水印模型上评估，证明该方法能有效伪造水印，质疑当前水印方法的安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法比相关工作更简单实用，能够有效伪造水印，对当前水印方法的安全性提出了挑战。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督微调方法存在模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题，主要依赖预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值，需要更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 提出Bi-CoG方法，利用模型间和模型内双重一致性指导，结合错误感知动态伪标签分配策略，为预训练视觉语言模型的半监督微调提供高质量伪标签。

Result: 在14个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Bi-CoG能够持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG通过双重一致性指导和动态伪标签分配，有效解决了半监督微调中的模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题，是一种简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解为零膨胀和长尾分布两部分分别处理，显著提升了强降雨的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中受限于标签分布不平衡，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致罕见样本（如强降雨）检索性能下降。

Method: 采用分治策略：使用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非雨样本主导），提出IMDL方法处理长尾分布（轻雨样本远多于强雨样本），将学习目标转化为无偏的理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL优于传统方法、代价敏感学习、生成式学习和多任务学习方法，有效缓解系统低估问题，显著改善强到极端降雨的检索能力。

Conclusion: IMDL为环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用解决方案，能够增强罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一个基于层论的去中心化多模态对齐框架，用多个比较空间替代单一空间对齐，通过层结构建模模态间关系，使用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态间存在相互冗余，这一假设在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种不要求所有模态相互冗余的新方法。

Method: 提出层论框架SheafAlign，使用层结构建模成对模态关系，采用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练，在多个比较空间中进行对齐。

Result: 在多模态传感数据集上的实验显示，该方法在零样本泛化、跨模态对齐和模态缺失鲁棒性方面表现优异，通信成本比现有最优方法降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign克服了先前方法的局限性，不需要所有模态间的相互冗余，同时保留了共享和独特信息，在分布式多模态对齐中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 零样本强化学习领域缺乏共同的分析框架，现有方法难以直接比较，需要统一的组织框架来促进该领域的发展。

Method: 引入一致的符号系统和分类法，将算法分为直接表示（学习从奖励到策略的端到端映射）和组合表示（利用价值函数子结构分解表示）两类。

Result: 建立了统一的零样本RL框架，揭示了不同方法间的共享原则和关键差异，并为后继特征方法推导了扩展边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为零样本强化学习提供了理论基础，为开发更通用的智能体指明了清晰路径。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Motivation: 图重布线技术虽然能缓解图神经网络中的过度挤压问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前尚不清楚需要保留哪些结构特性才能同时保证性能提升和结构保真度。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重布线策略，并将局部和全局图属性的变化与节点分类准确性相关联。

Result: 结果显示一致模式：成功的重布线方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重布线策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

Motivation: 现有端到端推理模型在训练分布之外的泛化能力有限，无法有效解决比训练样本更复杂的问题。

Method: 学习子问题的能量景观，在测试时通过组合多个子问题的能量函数构建全局能量景观，并引入并行能量最小化(PEM)来提升采样质量。

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越了现有最先进方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题。

Conclusion: 通过组合子问题能量函数的方法有效提升了推理模型的泛化能力，为解决复杂推理问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

TL;DR: 本文对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行了系统分析，改进了ES条件的解释和常数设置，推导了全梯度范数期望的界，并证明了不同步长策略下的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性(ES)条件作为灵活替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 重新解释和改进期望平滑性条件，引入采样相关常数；推导全梯度范数平方期望的界；分析不同步长策略下的收敛性。

Result: 证明了SGD在ES条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了显式的残差误差表达式。

Conclusion: 本文的分析统一并扩展了近期相关工作，为SGD在期望平滑性条件下的收敛性提供了完整理论框架。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

TL;DR: 该论文研究在有限计算预算下代码生成任务的检索设计，比较了不同检索配置在代码补全和缺陷定位任务中的表现，发现BM25+词级分割在PL-PL任务中最有效，而专有密集编码器在NL-PL任务中表现更好但延迟高100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下代码导向生成任务的检索设计，为构建有效的代码RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena的两个互补任务（代码补全和缺陷定位），系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: (1) PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25+词级分割最有效且实用；(2) NL-PL任务中专有密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍；(3) 最佳分块大小随可用上下文扩展；(4) 基于行的分块与语法感知分割效果相当；(5) 检索延迟在不同配置间差异达200倍。

Conclusion: 提供了基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率的代码导向RAG系统实施建议，BM25+词级分割提供了最佳质量-延迟权衡。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting

configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MS-BART是一个统一建模框架，通过大规模预训练将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表中，解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在多个关键指标上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据解析结构仍具挑战性。现有大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱领域，因为原始谱信号复杂且异构。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架，将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表，通过大规模预训练在可靠计算的指纹-分子数据集上进行跨模态学习。采用多任务预训练目标，联合优化去噪和翻译任务。通过MIST生成的指纹预测对实验谱图进行微调，并引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: MS-BART在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的12个关键指标中5个达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的竞争方法快一个数量级。消融研究系统验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模和大规模预训练有效解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在分子结构解析任务中表现出色，为质谱分析提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批量大小B，揭示了理论与实践的差异，并提出了基于累积DP噪声的优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私迁移学习实践中，裁剪边界C和批量大小B的选择存在理论与经验结果不匹配的问题，需要深入分析梯度分布变化和累积DP噪声的影响。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，将裁剪视为梯度重加权形式，并研究在有限计算预算下累积DP噪声对批量大小选择的影响。

Result: 发现强隐私下理论建议小C但实践需要大C，现有批量大小启发式方法无效，累积DP噪声能更好解释批量大小选择，单一(C,B)设置会导致次优性能。

Conclusion: 在差分隐私迁移学习中，需要根据隐私约束和计算预算动态调整裁剪边界和批量大小，考虑梯度分布变化和累积DP噪声的影响以获得最优性能。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种新颖算法，通过将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同空间来学习显著特征表示，促进学习低维任务相关特征，并建立鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法往往难以有效分离显著和非显著特征，导致模型可能依赖不相关的输入组件。H-SPLID旨在通过显式分解来促进学习更具鲁棒性和任务相关性的特征表示。

Method: H-SPLID算法将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同的表示空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)来约束输入与表示之间的关系，并通过理论分析建立预测偏差与显著子空间维度之间的联系。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证评估表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出降低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的理论联系，通过显式特征分解促进了低维、任务相关特征的学习，提高了模型对非显著扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种公平感知生存建模方法(FASM)，旨在减轻生存分析中的算法偏见，特别是在组内和跨组风险排名方面，应用于乳腺癌预后数据取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在医疗领域的广泛应用，临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。在生存分析中，删失和时间动态性进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。现有公平方法常忽视跨组排名差异，可能导致高风险黑人患者被排在低风险白人患者之下，强化生物本质主义并损害公平医疗。

Method: 提出了公平感知生存建模(FASM)方法，专门设计用于减轻关于组内和跨组风险排名的算法偏见。该方法应用于SEER乳腺癌数据，通过时间分层评估验证其效果。

Result: FASM在保持与无公平意识生存模型相当的判别性能的同时，显著提高了公平性。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年随访期内保持稳定的公平性，其中中期随访阶段的改善最为明显。

Conclusion: 该方法使得开发既关注准确性又重视公平性的生存模型成为可能，将公平性作为临床决策的核心原则，推进了临床护理中的公平性理念。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Conclusion: LLM/LMM在自主通信系统中具有巨大潜力，能够有效处理动态环境和多模态条件，为6G通信提供更智能和自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot

Conclusion: DiRecGNN框架有效解决了云服务监控中的实体推荐问题，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Motivation: 尽管互信息在表示学习中广泛应用，但直接优化KL散度往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化Jensen-Shannon散度等替代依赖度量，但这些代理目标与互信息之间的关系尚不明确。

Method: 推导了KL散度作为JSD函数的新紧致下界，并将其专门化到联合分布和边缘分布，证明最大化JSD基信息能提高互信息的保证下界。通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失实现JSD基目标。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中紧致，相比现有变分下界神经估计器，能提供稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计，并在信息瓶颈框架中展示实用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力实证证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗急症）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型因数据不平衡和忽略中间事件信息而难以准确预测

Method: 使用知识蒸馏从低稀有度事件模型中转移信息，并引入专家混合机制动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出

Result: 在多个数据集上实验显示，xTime对极端事件的预测准确率从3%提升到78%

Conclusion: xTime框架通过知识蒸馏和MoE机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Motivation: 灵长类或人类生物数据稀缺，高吞吐量记录技术难以应用，这给深度学习解码技术带来挑战。

Method: 使用神经元特异性最兴奋输入、结构相似性指数测量损失和对抗训练的生物启发解码方法。

Result: 在V1区单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面达到最先进性能，尤其在小数据集上表现优异，仅需1000-2500个神经元和少于1000个训练数据点即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中容易受到干扰，现有数据驱动方法虽然能实现合理定位，但由于空间上下文有限，难以准确重建接收信号强度场。

Method: 采用混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，将物理路径损耗模型与卷积神经网络通过log-linear pooling融合，PL专家确保物理一致性，CNN利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应，使用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性集中在干扰源附近和传播最敏感的城市峡谷区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功提升了GNSS干扰源定位精度和RSS场重建质量，同时提供了可靠的后验不确定性估计，特别适用于复杂的城市环境。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Conclusion: 结合梯度分析和选择性矩阵分解，实现了快速、鲁棒的LLM下游任务适配，仅需少量计算资源即可获得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

TL;DR: Spikachu是一个基于脉冲神经网络(SNN)的可扩展、因果且高能效的神经解码框架，在保持实时性能的同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的神经解码方法面临两难：简单因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂非因果模型虽然泛化好但难以实时应用，且都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络。

Method: 通过将分箱的脉冲直接投影到共享潜在空间，使用适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取特征，然后整合和解码这些潜在表示来生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人灵长类动物的113个记录会话上测试，比因果基线性能更好，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍，多会话训练还能实现少样本迁移到未见过的会话、主体和任务。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，在保持与最先进模型竞争性能的同时，能耗降低了数个数量级。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究通过数据驱动建模方法，将约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具与临床有意义指标更好对齐，使用约束评分优化模型显著提升了跌倒风险预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过数据驱动方法改进约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具，使其与更多临床有意义指标对齐，提升住院患者跌倒风险预测的准确性。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性分析，使用约束评分优化模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与基准黑盒模型XGBoost进行比较。

Result: 约束评分优化模型显著优于当前JHFRAT（AUC-ROC从0.86提升至0.91），在风险标签变化时表现出更强的鲁棒性，且无论是否包含EHR变量都表现相似。

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统提供了坚实基础，可通过数据驱动优化技术系统性地改进住院患者跌倒预防方案和患者安全，改善风险评估和资源分配。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Conclusion: GNN模型是制造环境中在线异常预测的有前景解决方案，能够有效处理半导体制造中的复杂变量依赖关系。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种超越自然语言的"思维通信"范式，使智能体能够直接进行心灵对心灵的交流，类似于心灵感应。通过形式化为潜变量模型，理论证明了共享和私有潜在思维的可识别性，并开发了提取和分配思维的实际框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言的模糊性、间接性和有损性限制了集体智能的潜力。虽然机器不受这些限制，但大多数基于LLM的多智能体系统仍仅依赖自然语言交流。为了超越语言限制，需要实现更直接的思维层面通信。

Method: 将思维通信形式化为一般潜变量模型，其中智能体状态由潜在思维生成。在非参数设置下理论证明了共享和私有潜在思维的可识别性。开发了从所有智能体提取潜在思维并在通信前分配相关思维及其共享模式的框架。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试上的实验验证了理论，并证明了思维通信的协作优势。该范式可扩展到所有模态，因为大多数观测数据都来自隐藏的生成过程。

Conclusion: 思维通信范式揭示了利用隐藏世界的潜力，许多挑战仅通过表面观察无法解决，无论计算或数据规模如何。这项工作为超越自然语言限制的集体智能提供了新方向。

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Method: 假设每个模态遵循多元高斯混合分布，采用狄利克雷过程计算各分量的混合权重，利用DP的富者愈富特性动态分配特征贡献并选择最显著特征。

Conclusion: DP驱动的多模态学习框架能够自动实现模态内显著特征学习和跨模态对齐的最佳平衡，为多模态特征融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解国际象棋规则，而非仅仅学习训练数据中的模式，通过OOD场景测试其系统泛化能力。

Method: 训练270M参数的国际象棋Transformer模型，并在分布外场景（包括Chess960变体）中进行测试，分析其泛化能力和训练动态。

Result: 模型表现出组合泛化能力，能一致选择有效移动，在OOD谜题中生成高质量移动；在Chess960中表现不如符号AI，但在Lichess上差距较小；训练动态显示模型最初学习只移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够捕捉国际象棋的基本规则并表现出组合泛化，但在需要复杂策略适应的变体中仍不如基于显式搜索的符号AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

TL;DR: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，在推理时植入攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成的快速发展，后门漏洞等安全问题日益突出。虽然已有研究探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性（特别是文本引导）图生成领域仍缺乏深入研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在潜在扩散模型中秘密植入后门。当推理时出现触发器时，会诱导生成攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（PubChem、ChEBI-20、PCDes、MoMu）上的实验表明，攻击具有高效性和隐蔽性：不到10%的毒化率即可达到50%的攻击成功率，24%的毒化率足以实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，突显了在药物发现等模型应用中存在的严重风险，并强调了对此类扩散模型中后门攻击进行鲁棒防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了传统观点，证明在强化学习中，反向/正向KL散度的选择并不决定模式覆盖，而是定义了最优目标分布的参数化形式。模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度、奖励与参考概率的相对尺度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为反向KL导致"模式寻求"，正向KL导致"质量覆盖"，但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习正则化中并不适用，需要重新理解KL散度选择对目标分布的影响。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，构建了一个简单、可扩展的理论算法，最小化修改奖励幅度，优化目标分布以覆盖所有高质量采样模式。

Result: 该方法在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后期训练中，无需外部多样性信号，就能同时提高解决方案质量和多样性，且适用于正向和反向KL。

Conclusion: 模式覆盖主要由正则化强度和其他因素决定，而非KL散度类型。提出的算法能有效提升模型输出的多样性和质量。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.
