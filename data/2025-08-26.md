### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度感知的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感固有的空间分辨率低、视场窄以及在复杂场景中结构失真的局限性问题。

Method: 首先通过精确的几何校准和对齐模块将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取iToF深度和RGB图像的互补特征，并利用单目深度先验恢复精细结构细节和进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束的集成，实现了增强的深度精度、改进的边缘清晰度和无缝的视场扩展。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [2] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成逼真图像方面表现出色，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时不可靠，特别是在复杂和高密度设置中。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，交替进行图像生成和多模态代理评估，使用语言引导的规划器和评论器评估对象计数、空间布局和属性一致性，并引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新高实例基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确性，同时保持空间保真度和视觉质量，得分0.97，优于基于布局和梯度引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代反馈机制有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，为复杂场景生成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现CLIP视觉编码器中MLP层的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合推理和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在困难，限制了处理新对象属性组合的能力，需要探究其根本原因。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器，发现MLP层中单个神经元同时表示多个特征的叠加现象。

Result: 证明特征叠加现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示，从而影响了组合推理和对象绑定能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为揭示视觉语言模型中组合失败机制根源迈出了第一步，相关代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [4] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个解决视觉语言导航中空间推理、跨模态对齐和内存过载问题的框架，通过集成记忆模块、空间模块和决策模块，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的端到端VLN方法存在空间推理能力弱、跨模态对齐差、长时任务内存过载等关键脆弱性问题，需要系统性地解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个模块：1）记忆模块-动态地图内存通过选择性节点剪枝处理内存过载；2）空间模块-基于Qwen-Sp模型进行空间推理和物体关系推断；3）决策模块-基于LLM的路径规划执行动作。还构建了I-O-S数据集来支持空间模块训练。

Result: 在Room-to-Room和REVERIE数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了成功率(SR)和路径长度加权成功率(SPL)。Qwen-Sp在I-O-S测试集上的物体列表提取任务中F1和NDCG分数优于主流商业LLM。

Conclusion: MSNav通过模块化架构将脆弱的推理转化为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了VLN任务中的关键挑战，为多模态导航系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [6] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于视觉-语言模型的可解释性增材制造质量评估框架，通过知识萌荐提升了评估的可信过和一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法在增材制造质量评估中的黑盒问题，提供可解释的质量判断以增强信任和应用

Method: 提出QA-VLM框架，利用视觉-语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，结合同行审查期刊知识萌荐的应用特定知识

Result: 在24个激光线直接能量汇凑单珍样品上评估，框架在解释质量方面显示出比商用VLM更高的有效性和一致性

Conclusion: 该方法有力支持可信过、可解释的增材制造质量评估，推动智能化质量控制的实际应用

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [7] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出The Loupe轻量级注意力模块，插入预训练视觉Transformer中，无需部件级标注即可引导模型关注判别性区域，在提升精度的同时提供可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类需要识别细微局部特征，现有Vision Transformer虽然性能优秀但缺乏可解释性，在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中需要可信的决策过程

Method: 设计可插拔的The Loupe注意力模块，使用复合损失函数进行端到端训练，隐式引导模型关注最具判别力的物体部位，无需显式部件标注

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，将Swin-Base模型准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%（提升2.66%），注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能的同时提供清晰的可视化解释，为理解和信任模型决策提供有价值工具

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [8] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络分析COVID19病人肺部CT扫描图像，预测病情严重程度，帮助医生做出临床决策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID19大流行造成全球医疗资源紧张，病人因呼吸力衰竭而死亡。需要更准确的病情评估方法来优化治疗资源分配

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于病人CT扫描图像进行分析。在病人检测阻性后一个月内，根据CT图像预测病情严重程度（是否需要插管或导致死亡）

Result: 计算机模型能够提高诊断准确性，减少人为误差，通过训练进行持续改进

Conclusion: 深度学习模型可以有效地预测COVID19病人病情严重程度，为医生提供量化的临床决策支持，有助于优化医疗资源配置

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedRepBench是一个针对医学报告结构化理解的新基准测试，包含1900份中文医疗报告，支持客观和主观评估协议，并展示了通过GRPO优化VLM性能的方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化基准来评估医学报告的结构化解释质量，需要建立综合评估体系来推动医疗文档理解技术的发展

Method: 构建包含1900份真实中文医疗报告的基准数据集，设计客观评估（字段级召回率）和主观评估（使用LLM作为评分代理）两种协议，并应用GRPO算法优化VLM模型

Result: 通过GRPO优化使VLM模型获得高达6%的召回率提升，OCR+LLM流水线性能强劲但存在布局盲区和延迟问题

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医学报告结构化理解提供了标准化评估框架，证明了VLM优化的有效性，同时指出了纯文本方法的局限性，推动基于视觉的稳健报告理解技术发展

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级两阶段框架用于无人机实时野火监测，第一阶段通过策略网络压缩冗余视频帧降低计算成本，第二阶段使用改进YOLOv8定位火源，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害应急响应中日益重要，但由于计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析，需要开发轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络识别和丢弃冗余视频片段，引入站点机制利用未来帧信息提高准确性；第二阶段对分类为"火灾"的帧使用改进的YOLOv8模型进行火源定位。

Result: 在FLAME和HMDB51数据集上评估第一阶段，在Fire & Smoke数据集上评估第二阶段。实验显示第一阶段在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算成本，第二阶段相比基线方法在相似推理时间下获得更高检测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机平台提供了有效的实时野火监测解决方案，成功平衡了计算效率和检测精度，适用于资源受限的无人机环境。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个基于空间感知深度学习的框架，通过自然语言类比分析全切片图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域视为短语、组织结构视为句子，自动学习上下文依赖关系来预测肺腺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在术后5年内复发，现有工具无法准确识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet框架，将病理图像建模为自然语言：细胞=单词，细胞邻域=短语，组织结构=句子，通过深度学习自动学习空间相互作用和细胞变异对复发风险的影响。

Result: 在456个H&E染色全切片图像数据集上，CellEcoNet达到AUC 77.8%和HR 9.54，显著优于IASLC分级系统、AJCC分期和现有计算方法，并在不同人群亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了优越的预后预测性能，更重要的是通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"，揭示了细胞细微变异如何编码复发风险，代表了病理学分析方法的范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

*Marco N. Bochernitsan,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种使用帕絗托最优前沿来评估文本到图像生成模型公平性和效用的方法，发现大多数默认超参数配置都不是最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型公平性评估方法依赖于主观的人工视觉检查，容易出错且难以复现，需要更可重现的评估方法来同时考察公平性和效用。

Method: 使用帕絗托最优前沿来评估文本到图像模型的公平性和效用，采用标准化的工具（如Normalized Shannon Entropy和ClipScore）进行量化分析。

Result: 在多个流行文本到图像模型中评测发现，大多数默认超参数配置都是被帕絗托前沿上的被屏蔽解，可以通过调整超参数轻松找到更好的公平性-效用平衡点。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可重现、可量化的方式来评估和优化文本到图像生成模型的公平性与效用平衡，为质量AI发展提供了重要的评测工具。

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

TL;DR: WebMMU是一个多语言基准测试，评估网站视觉问答、代码编辑和原型到代码生成三个核心Web任务，揭示当前多模态大语言模型在复杂推理、精确元素定位和功能保持方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试将这些Web任务分开处理，缺乏对模型在复杂多步推理、精确元素定位以及功能性UI理解和编码能力的统一评估。

Method: 使用专家标注的真实Web数据，统一评估三个核心Web任务：网站视觉问答、HTML/CSS/JavaScript代码编辑、原型到代码生成。

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理和定位、保持功能性的代码编辑、以及生成支持多语言内容和保持层次结构的设计到代码方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型存在重要局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化Web开发任务的未来Web代理。

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Conclusion: OVODA框架有效解决了开放词汇3D检测问题，证明了基础模型在连接3D视觉与文本语义方面的潜力，OVAD数据集为该研究方向提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在天文图像处理中存在局限性，需要计算昂贵的差异成像。本文旨在开发更适合像素级比较的架构，提高超新星检测的准确性和效率。

Method: 采用Transformer架构的神经网络，直接分析搜索图像和模板图像，无需进行差异成像处理。网络能够进行详细的像素级比较。

Result: 在Dark Energy Survey的autoScan数据集上达到97.4%的分类准确率，随着训练集增大，差异图像的性能效用逐渐降低。即使输入图像未以超新星候选为中心，网络仍能保持相似性能水平。

Conclusion: 该Transformer网络显著提高了大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，为天文瞬变检测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

TL;DR: NinA使用归一化流替代扩散模型作为VLA的动作解码器，实现单次采样，大幅提升推理速度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为动作解码器需要多次迭代去噪步骤，推理速度慢，限制了在需要高频控制的现实场景中的实用性。

Method: 用归一化流(NF)替换扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现一次性采样，集成到FLOWER VLA架构并在LIBERO基准上微调。

Result: NinA在相同训练条件下与扩散模型性能相当，但推理速度显著更快。

Conclusion: NinA为高效、高频的VLA控制提供了一条有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Motivation: 6G时代需要大规模天线阵列和精确空间信道状态信息，传统信道建模方法在空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性方面面临挑战，现有辐射场方法存在几何不准确和昂贵监督的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用平面高斯作为几何基元进行密集表面对齐场景重建；第二阶段结合全结构无线电辐射和定制多视图损失精确建模无线电传播行为。

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高了重建精度，降低了训练成本，实现了无线信道的高效表示。

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案，解决了传统方法和现有辐射场方法的局限性。

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

Result: 在FIRE数据集上，目标配准误差从6.2px降至~2.4px，25px处的AUC从0.770提升至0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO通过在高梯度区域锚定节点确保稳健梯度流，有效解决纹理稀疏区域的梯度消失问题，为视网膜图像配准提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DreamBooth等个性化文本到图像模型需要微调大规模扩散主干网络，在维护多个主题特定模型时会产生显著的存储开销

Method: 利用权重增量具有强低秩结构的特点，应用奇异值分解(SVD)分解权重增量，然后基于能量的秩截断策略平衡压缩效率和重建保真度

Result: 在多主题数据集上的实验表明，Delta-SVD实现了显著的压缩，在CLIP分数、SSIM和FID等生成质量指标上损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，为需要存储和部署大规模主题定制化的实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Motivation: 视觉内容在社交媒体中日益重要，但情感感知与复杂的场景级语义紧密相关，理解视觉内容如何传达情感是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出MLLMsent框架，从三个角度研究MLLMs的情感推理能力：(1)直接图像情感分类；(2)关联预训练LLM分析自动生成的图像描述；(3)在情感标注图像描述上微调LLM。

Result: 在基准测试中，微调方法比Lexicon、CNN和Transformer基线分别提升30.9%、64.8%和42.4%。跨数据集测试中，无需新数据训练仍比最佳竞争对手提升8.26%。

Conclusion: 该视觉推理方案在情感计算方面具有巨大潜力，为未来研究建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

Motivation: 解决恶劣天气条件下视觉信息损失问题，现有方法缺乏对文本信息的有效分类和深入分析，需要更好的语义感知能力来提供更清晰的场景表示。

Method: 提出AWM-Fuse方法，包含全局特征感知模块（使用BLIP生成字幕提取整体场景特征和主要退化类型）和局部模块（使用ChatGPT生成详细场景描述关注具体退化效果），通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进方法，实验证明能够有效提升图像融合质量。

Conclusion: AWM-Fuse通过结合全局和局部文本感知，在恶劣天气条件下实现了更好的多模态图像融合效果，为语义感知提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Conclusion: SAEViT为各种基础视觉任务提供了一个高效的轻量级解决方案，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法主要关注整体分数拟合，忽略了人类通常从多个维度评估图像质量的事实，需要更符合人类感知的多维度评估方法。

Method: 构建包含5个技术维度和4个美学维度的多分支网络，每个分支单独训练特定维度特征，最后融合各维度特征生成最终质量评分。

Conclusion: 多维图像质量评估框架能够更好地模拟人类视觉感知的多面性，为图像质量评估和图像恢复任务提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

### [28] [MSPCaps: A Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network with Cross-Agreement Routing for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16922)
*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和跨协议路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽略多尺度信息和特征融合困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征；补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一划分为初级胶囊；跨协议路由(CAR)块通过识别最大协议跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps在分类准确率方面持续超越多个基线方法，展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，参数配置从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K参数)到强大的Large模型(10.9M参数)。

Conclusion: MSPCaps通过整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，显著提升了特征表示学习能力，为视觉识别任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

TL;DR: CC-CMR是一个基于对比学习和跨模态对齐的框架，用于无钆对比剂的心肌病筛查，通过将电影CMR与LGE序列的潜在空间对齐，在电影CMR中编码纤维化特异性病理信息，实现了94.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)是心肌病诊断的金标准，但依赖钆对比剂和人工密集解读限制了其在人群规模筛查中的应用，需要开发无钆的自动化筛查方法。

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，通过特征交互模块同时优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，并采用不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标。

Result: 在231名受试者的多中心数据上评估，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的仅电影CMR模型提升4.3%，同时消除了钆依赖性。

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行无钆心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为大规模筛查提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

Conclusion: 该方法通过建立3D与文本空间的直接对齐，为3D内容个性化提供了高效便捷的解决方案，克服了传统方法需要重新训练的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAT方法通过针对神经网络中的特定神经元进行攻击，而不是传统的层级别优化，显著提高了对抗样本的跨模型和跨域迁移性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在中间层进行嵌入分离优化时往往过度关注少数相似概念的神经元，而忽略了同一层中其他神经元，导致迁移攻击效果受限

Method: 提出神经元攻击迁移性方法(NAT)，从嵌入级别分离转向更基础的神经元特异性方法，针对单个神经元进行攻击以破坏神经网络的核心单元

Result: 在41个ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上的实验显示，NAT在跨模型设置中超越现有基线14%以上，跨域设置中超越4%以上，仅需10次查询即可达到高欺骗率

Conclusion: 针对特定神经元的攻击方法为对抗样本迁移性提供了更有效的基础，通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，实现了高效的少查询攻击

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只提供最终评分而缺乏解释性分析，限制了在体育、医疗和机器人等领域的实际应用，需要能够提供详细反馈和可解释推理的动作评估系统。

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合分步推理和策略学习，成功实现了准确、结构化且可解释的人类动作评估，解决了现有方法缺乏解释性的问题。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过结合物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾条件下的图像去雾挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的能见度增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Motivation: 传统基于网格的3D仿真在复杂环境（如密集温室）中表现不佳，而现有的神经渲染方法虽然视觉逼真但缺乏集成基准标记的能力，而基准标记对机器人定位和控制至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种混合框架，将高斯泼溅(GS)的光照真实感与结构化标记表示相结合，核心贡献是提出了一种在杂乱场景中高效生成基于GS的基准标记（如AprilTags）的新算法。

Conclusion: 该框架在具有密集 foliage、相似元素和遮挡的农业环境中表现出色，突显了其在现实世界应用中的价值，特别是在需要高精度定位的机器人仿真场景中。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考群体计数的本质特征：个体（人头）在图像中通常占据很小比例，现有工作忽视了这一特性而追求大感受野。

Method: 提出LIMM模型，采用窗口划分设计对输入应用网格窗口，使用窗口对比学习增强局部密度区分能力，并在模型末端加入全局注意力模块处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该模型在局部建模能力上有显著提升（如在JHU-Crowd++高密度子集上MAE提升8.7%），同时保持对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是群体计数任务的重要设计原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口策略有效解决了小尺寸个体的计数问题，为群体计数研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers
in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal
representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as
images, point clouds, and text. This article takes a step toward solving this
problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps,
classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在视觉扰动下的脆弱性，提出的RDR框架和评估方法为提升模型在真实科学应用中的鲁棒性提供了重要基础

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序特征提取和创新的损失函数设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了场景流估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model

Conclusion: BSAM通过平衡泛化能力有效解决了不平衡回归问题，提供了理论泛化边界保证

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

*Yuzhi Lai,Shenghai Yuan,Peizheng Li,Jun Lou,Andreas Zell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEER-VAR是一个新颖的以自我为中心的车辆增强现实框架，通过语义分解、上下文感知SLAM分支和LLM驱动的推荐系统，实现了动态的车内和道路场景分离，并在真实驾驶环境中展示了鲁棒的空间对齐和感知一致的AR渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AR系统通常假设静态或单视图设置，无法有效处理动态驾驶环境中的复杂场景分离和上下文感知需求，需要一种能够统一处理车内和道路场景的增强现实解决方案。

Method: 采用深度引导的视觉-语言基础进行动态场景分离，使用两个SLAM分支分别跟踪自我中心运动，并基于GPT的模块生成上下文感知的覆盖层（如仪表盘提示和危险警报）。

Result: 实验证明SEER-VAR在不同环境中实现了鲁棒的空间对齐和感知一致的AR渲染，通过用户研究显示其增强了场景理解、覆盖层相关性和驾驶便利性。

Conclusion: SEER-VAR作为首个探索基于LLM的AR推荐系统在自我中心驾驶中的应用，为未来研究方向提供了有效基础，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code
and dataset will be made open source.

TL;DR: HCG-LVLM是一个分层上下文接地视觉语言大模型，采用从粗到细的认知处理方式，通过全局上下文感知和细粒度局部接地两层架构，显著提升了视觉语言理解的准确性和减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言大模型在复杂现实场景中表现出鲁棒性不足、容易产生幻觉和推理错误的问题，特别是在需要精确图像区域定位和细粒度视觉推理的任务中。

Method: 提出HCG-LVLM架构，包含全局上下文感知层和细粒度局部接地层。局部接地层包含局部细节增强模块和高分辨率特征提取，以及语义一致性验证器确保准确的视觉语言对齐，通过自适应融合机制整合两层信息。

Result: 在GQA、A-OKVQA和RefCOCO/+/g等挑战性数据集上的实验表明，HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4。

Conclusion: HCG-LVLM的分层设计有效提升了细粒度视觉语言理解和精确接地能力，实现了更高的准确性和显著减少的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

### [43] [Robust Point Cloud Registration via Geometric Overlapping Guided Rotation Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17427)
*Zhao Zheng,Jingfan Fan,Long Shao,Hong Song,Danni Ai,Tianyu Fu,Deqiang Xiao,Yongtian Wang,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于旋转分析的几何最大重叠注册框架，通过旋转轴搜索和范围最大查询问题解决，在保证精度的同时提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前图形基方法需要二次时空复杂度，而多阶段分析搜索方法容易困于局部最优解的问题，需要一种更高效精确的点云注册方法。

Method: 使用Chasles定理将刚体变换分解为沿旋转轴平移和2D刚体变换，通过旋转轴分析搜索和范围最大查询(RMQ)问题来优化注册过程。首先搜索top-k旋转轴候选，然后通过扫描线算法求解1D旋转角度。

Result: 在3DMatch、3DLoMatch和KITTI数据集上进行实验，证明该方法在精度和效率方面都超过了当前最先进方法，时间复杂度为多项式，空间复杂度与点数成线性关系。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效精确的点云注册解决方案，通过旋转分析和RMQ问题形式化，有效充分利用了几何约束来提升性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

manner. Performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric on the training and
testing datasets, followed by a prediction score on a random image of people,
irrespective of their realness. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results
on the test dataset to meticulously detect Deepfake images.

Conclusion: 合成优先方案是开发安全关键工业应用中可靠感知系统的高效、经济、安全的替代方案

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全参数微调会损害预训练模型固有泛化能力的问题，需要在任务适应和泛化保持之间取得平衡

Method: 使用双操作符选择机制，识别并更新在所有源域中表现出一致且显著梯度的参数，限制只更新少量稀疏参数子集

Result: 在基准实验中表现出色，优于最先进的领域泛化方法，证明了方法的效率和有效性

Conclusion: JPS方法通过理论分析和实验验证，为选择性微调提供了原则性依据，成功平衡了任务适应和泛化保持

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: HiCache是一个无需训练的特征预测加速框架，通过Hermite多项式对齐和双尺度机制，在扩散模型中实现6.24倍加速同时保持质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成效果好但计算成本高，现有特征缓存方法因无法建模复杂特征演化动态而导致质量损失

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论最优基函数，并引入双尺度机制确保数值稳定性

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev上实现6.24倍加速且质量超过基线，在文本到图像、视频生成和超分辨率任务中均表现优异

Conclusion: HiCache通过数学工具与经验特性的对齐，从根本上改进了特征预测，为扩散模型提供了高效且高质量的推理加速方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出EDLDNet，一种高效的双线解码器分割网络，通过噪声解码器训练提升鲁棒性，推理时仅使用无噪声解码器降低计算成本，在多个医学影像数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在医学图像分割中无法平衡分割精度和计算效率的问题，大多数方法要么以高计算复杂度为代价优先考虑性能，要么为了效率而牺牲准确性。

Method: 提出EDLDNet网络，包含噪声解码器（训练时加入结构化扰动提升鲁棒性，推理时只执行无噪声解码器）、多尺度卷积注意力模块(MSCAMs)、注意力门(AGs)和上卷积块(UCBs)，并利用基于突变的损失函数增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: EDLDNet在多样化数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力、计算效率和鲁棒性，为医学图像器官风险分割提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Motivation: 现有的弱监督语义分割方法过于强调类间分离，往往忽略了相关类别之间的共享语义，并且缺乏细粒度的区分能力。

Method: 提出对比提示聚类(CPC)框架：1)利用大语言模型推导编码类间关系的类别聚类；2)引入类感知的patch级对比损失来增强类内一致性和类间分离；3)分层设计利用聚类作为粗粒度语义先验，同时保持细粒度边界。

Conclusion: CPC通过结合大语言模型生成的语义聚类和对比学习机制，有效解决了弱监督语义分割中类间关系建模和细粒度区分的问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Motivation: 标准扩散模型容易记忆训练样本，在风格变化和生成清晰度方面遇到困难，生成文本容易出现扭曲和偏差

Method: 提出双正交指导(DOG)策略，利用负向提示的正交投影到正向提示的方法，采用三角式调度控制指导强度

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM上的实验结果显示，DOG在内外词汇和挑战性笔迹风格下都能提升内容清晰度和风格变化能力

Conclusion: DOG指导策略能够生成更多样化且可靠的手写文本，解决了标准扩散模型在读取性和风格控制方面的限制

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Conclusion: PTMA模型通过概率建模和多视角信息整合，有效提取视角不变特征，显著提升了在线动作检测的跨视角泛化能力

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有深度假写检测方法存在两大问题：一是深度卷积网络在特定类别上过拟合，跨类别转移性差；二是全局平均池化(GAP)会丢失关键的局部伪造线索，影响真假图片的区分能力。

Method: 提出局部聚焦机制(LFM)，整合显著性网络(SNet)和Top-K池化(TKP)模块，选择K个最有信息的局部模式。为了避免Top-K池化导致的过拟合，还引入了排名基线性抛弃(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)两种正则化技术。

Conclusion: 局部聚焦机制通过关注区别性局部特征，有效解决了现有深度假写检测方法的跨领域和跨类别问题，为深度假写检测领域提供了一种高效、精准的新方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境下有效，通过多模态特征融合显著提升了食物图像-文本检索性能，代码和测试数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We present StyleClone, a method for training image-to-image translation
networks to stylize faces in a specific style, even with limited style images.
Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image
generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating
diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face
images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this
augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that
outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on

Motivation: 室外环境中的LiDAR扫描数据通常极其稀疏，严重影响下游3D感知任务。现有方法主要针对单个物体，在复杂室外场景中泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用无分类器引导的DDPMs，以稀疏点云为引导条件，附近帧合成的点云为输入。设计体素补全模块细化体素特征，提出点-体素交互模块整合点云和体素特征。

Conclusion: PVNet通过点-体素交互和扩散模型有效解决了室外场景点云稀疏问题，显著提升了3D场景理解能力。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

Method: 采用双阶段生成对抗网络框架，首先使用鲁棒的无配对图像转换模型生成语义一致的照片级帧，然后转换为更简单的配对图像转换任务进行轻量级训练。

Conclusion: REGEN框架成功解决了游戏实时照片级真实感增强的难题，在保持高质量的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSG-DiT是一个新颖的基于空间信号引导的扩散变换器框架，通过解耦的两阶段过程实现高保真可控视频生成，解决了现有模型语义一致性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持语义一致性方面存在挑战，经常生成与提示细节不符的视频内容，需要更精确的空间控制机制。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段过程：第一阶段通过预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；第二阶段通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT主干，采用双分支注意力机制。

Result: 在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在空间关系控制和整体一致性等关键指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SSG-DiT框架通过空间信号引导和高效的适配器设计，成功提升了可控视频生成的语义一致性和空间控制精度。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

### [59] [Proximal Vision Transformer: Enhancing Feature Representation through Two-Stage Manifold Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17081)
*Haoyu Yun,Hamid Krim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，将ViT与近端工具结合，通过统一的几何优化方法来改善特征表示和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ViT在计算机视觉中取得了显著成功，但其优化仅限于建模单张图像内部的局部关系，无法捐捕数据点之间的全局几何关系。

Method: 通过ViT的自注意力机制构建流形的切线束，每个注意力头对应一个切线空间，提供多样化的局部视角几何表示。然后引入近端迭代来定义切线束内的截面并将数据从切线空间投影到基空间。

Result: 实验结果证实，该方法在分类准确性和数据分布方面都超过传统ViT。

Conclusion: 这种统一的几何优化框架有效地增强了ViT的特征表示能力，实现了全局特征对齐和优化。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

Motivation: 解决现有深度度量学习方法的问题：成对损失需要复杂采样且收敛慢，代理损失无法优化全局分布特性，而基于可分性指标的D-Loss又需要大批量计算

Method: 通过代理估计真实分布和冒名分布，将可学习代理与统计可分性框架d'相结合，在保持代理方法计算效率的同时实现分布感知优化

Conclusion: PD-Loss成功结合了代理方法的计算效率和统计可分性优化的优势，为分布感知的深度度量学习提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLM系统需要密集像素监督训练，成本高昂且在域外数据上表现不佳，需要更高效且泛化能力强的解决方案

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成边界框和正点，然后输入预训练分割模型作为提示生成最终掩码，仅通过GRPO强化学习优化，无需掩码监督

Result: 在域内数据上提升约4%，在域外基准上提升高达54%，展示了强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，证明了方法的有效性和泛化性

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，通过整合局部细粒度和全局上下文信息，实现了卓越的分类性能，为计算机辅助诊断系统提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Natural disasters pose significant challenges to timely and accurate damage
assessment due to their sudden onset and the extensive areas they affect.
Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous
to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in
resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective
framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video
super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a
27 billion parameter Visual Language Model (VLM). This integrated system is
designed to improve low-resolution disaster footage, identify structural
damage, and classify buildings into four damage categories, ranging from
no/slight damage to total destruction, along with associated risk levels. The
methodology was validated using pre- and post-event drone imagery from the 2023
Turkey earthquakes (courtesy of The Guardian) and satellite data from the 2013
Moore Tornado (xBD dataset). The framework achieved a classification accuracy
of 84.5%, demonstrating its ability to provide highly accurate results.
Furthermore, the system's accessibility allows non-technical users to perform
preliminary analyses, thereby improving the responsiveness and efficiency of
disaster management efforts.

AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video

weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加图谱标注工作量的情况下提高了AD成像生物标志物的准确性，有助于更精确量化AD与脑萎缩的关系，为疾病追踪提供更准确的测量指标

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

TL;DR: 提出AdvCP方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景噪声问题，通过对抗提示挖掘和样本校正来提升性能，无需增加推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测仅依赖图像级标签，容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂遥感场景中

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：对抗提示挖掘（使用错误标签激活错误特征映射）和对抗样本校正（构建在线全局原型整合样本）

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM基线上均取得显著性能提升，且可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景

Conclusion: AdvCP能有效解决弱监督变化检测中的共现噪声问题，方法通用且无需额外推理成本

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Conclusion: 多模态伪标签方法能够以低成本构建高质量的文档封面图像生成数据集，为该任务提供了有效的数据支持

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Motivation: 现有的高速公路监控系统缺乏对复杂环境条件的综合理解能力，需要一种能够同时处理多种感知任务、平衡准确性和计算效率的解决方案，特别是在资源受限的环境中实现实时场景理解。

Method: 采用混合专家策略，使用大型通用视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）生成任务特定的思维链提示，然后指导小型高效VLM（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）对短视频和多模态数据进行推理。构建了三个专门数据集进行验证，其中路面湿度数据集结合视频流和道路天气传感器数据。

Conclusion: 该框架可轻松集成到现有交通摄像头系统中，特别适用于高风险农村地区（如急弯、洪水易发低地或结冰桥梁），通过持续监控目标站点来增强态势感知并提供及时警报，即使在资源受限的环境中也能有效工作。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Motivation: 当前基于2D图像的预训练表示忽略了世界的3D本质，但由于大规模3D数据稀缺，难以从网络数据集中提取通用3D表示，因此需要开发能提升所有3D表示的通用预训练框架

Method: FVP将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，使用扩散模型作为预测模型，直接在大型公共数据集上进行预训练

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D Diffusion Policy的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法的最先进性能，且适用于各种点云编码器和数据集

Conclusion: FVP是一个有效的4D视觉预训练框架，能够显著提升3D表示性能，并成功应用于更大的视觉-语言-动作机器人模型RDT-1B，在各种机器人任务中表现出色

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过引入透视编码(PE)和透视旋转(PR)来解决裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视失真问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法仅使用裁剪图像作为输入，但缺少相机内参信息导致关节相对深度估计不准确，且人体偏离图像中心会产生透视失真，增加了模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出透视编码(PE)来编码裁剪图像的相机内参，并提出透视旋转(PR)变换将人体置于图像中心以减少透视失真。结合两者构建PersPose框架。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到SOTA性能，特别是在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前SOTA方法降低了7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过有效处理相机内参和透视失真问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级插件模块在LVLM处理前预测并移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理单张图像会产生数千个视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有方法在浅层缺乏足够上下文信息时剪枝效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就具有固有冗余性。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用的剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可无缝集成到各种模型中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无需训练的剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为LVLMs提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下改善推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文首次定义并证明了多重嵌入攻击(MEA)的存在，提出了对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式来增强现有水印方法的鲁棒性，使其在二次嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，个人隐私面临严重威胁。现有的深度伪造主动取证方法依赖单一水印嵌入的理想假设，但在现实场景中，当受保护图像经历多次水印嵌入时，原始取证水印可能被破坏或移除，导致整个主动取证机制失效。

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟MEA场景，并引入韧性驱动的损失函数来强制学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示，而不需要修改网络架构。

Result: 大量实验证明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，使模型在二次嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。

Conclusion: AIS是一种即插即用的训练范式，能够有效解决多重嵌入攻击问题，提升深度伪造主动取证技术的实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

TL;DR: 提出ICPNet网络，通过多尺度特征投影、特征交互注意力机制和边缘融合模块，使深度神经网络能够像人类一样感知错觉轮廓，在AG-MNIST和AG-Fashion-MNIST数据集上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在真实任务中表现优异，但无法像人类一样感知错觉轮廓（如abutting grating），这种感知差异阻碍了机器智能与人类认知的对齐。

Method: 受视觉皮层回路启发，设计ICPNet网络：1）多尺度特征投影模块提取多尺度表示；2）特征交互注意力模块增强前馈和反馈特征的交互；3）边缘融合模块通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束，引导网络关注前景。

Result: 在AG-MNIST和新建的AG-Fashion-MNIST测试集上，ICPNet对错觉轮廓的敏感性显著优于最先进模型，在各种子集上的top-1准确率都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了基于DNN的模型向人类水平智能迈进一步，解决了神经网络与人类感知模式不对齐的问题。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

*Zhenyu Liu,Huizhi Liang,Xinrun Li,Vaclav Snasel,Varun Ojha*

TL;DR: 提出AdaGAT方法，通过动态调整引导模型的训练状态来提升目标模型的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗蒸馏方法中使用可学习的引导模型时，难以在协同训练过程中维持其最优状态进行有效知识迁移

Method: 开发AdaGAT方法，包含两个独立的损失函数，使引导模型更积极参与反向传播以达到最优状态

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上实验表明，适当调整引导模型能增强目标模型在各种对抗攻击下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: AdaGAT方法通过动态调整引导模型训练状态，有效提升了目标模型的对抗鲁棒性能

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction
detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained
human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines
generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction
detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction
recognition.

Motivation: 肌少症与手术不良结果相关，但手工测量肌肉面积耗时耗力，需要更高效的自动化方案

Method: 采用迁移学习和自监督学习，结合标注和未标注CT数据集训练深度学习模型进行肌肉面积测量

Result: 模型预测肌肉面积平均错误率±3%，预测分割掩码的Dice相似系数达93%，显示量化评估比质性检测更准确

Conclusion: 研究为肌少症评估提供了全自动化的可行途路径，有力解决数据不平衡和数据有限性问题

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的模态感知跟踪器MTNet，通过通道聚合分布模块和空间相似性感知模块提取模态特定线索，利用Transformer融合网络捕获全局依赖关系，采用三叉预测头和动态更新策略实现精确跟踪。


<details>

Motivation: 常规融合范式和固定跟踪模板限制了RGB-T跟踪中的特征交互能力，需要更有效的多模态表示学习方法来提升跟踪性能。

Method: 提出MTNet跟踪器：1）模态感知网络（CADM+SSPM）提取模态特定线索；2）Transformer融合网络捕获全局依赖；3）三叉预测头处理尺度变化和形变；4）动态更新策略维护可靠模板。

Result: 在三个RGB-T基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，同时实现实时跟踪速度。

Conclusion: MTNet通过模态感知和Transformer融合有效提升了RGB-T跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundDiff是一个基础扩散模型，通过剂量-解剖感知对比学习和自适应扩散去噪，实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一低剂量CT去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法通常针对特定剂量和解剖区域训练，难以处理不同扫描条件下的噪声特征和解剖异质性，限制了临床应用的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1) 剂量-解剖感知对比学习(DA-CLIP)学习连续表示量化剂量变化和识别解剖区域；2) 剂量-解剖感知扩散模型(DA-Diff)通过基于Mamba的条件块集成学习到的嵌入进行自适应去噪。

Result: 在两个公共LDCT数据集上的实验表明，FoundDiff在八个剂量水平和三个解剖区域上优于现有最先进方法，并对未见剂量水平具有显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff提供了一个统一的框架，能够有效处理不同剂量水平和解剖区域的低剂量CT去噪问题，具有出色的泛化性能。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型规模扩大，训练成本急剧增加，需要开发无需训练且可扩展的图像编辑框架来实现定制化对象的精准插入。

Method: 采用位置嵌入移植技术引导扩散模型复制参考对象的结构特征，结合角点中心布局将参考图像与背景图像拼接输入FLUX.1-Fill模型，在渐进去噪过程中指导目标区域的噪声分布。

Result: 大量实验表明PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真度和计算效率方面均优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: PosBridge框架具有实用价值和广泛应用潜力，为无需训练的局部图像编辑提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

<details>

Motivation: 小麦植物分割竞赛中，茎部具有精细结构且像素稀少，容易受到脆弱预测和类别不平衡的影响，而头部和叶子的分割已经相对成熟，因此需要专门针对茎部问题进行优化。

Method: 1) 使用动态上采样器SAPA增强细节描绘；2) 利用半监督引导蒸馏配合茎部感知样本选择挖掘未标注数据；3) 应用测试时缩放策略对图像进行两次放大分割。

Result: 该方法在MLCAS 2025 GWFSS挑战赛中获得第一名，明显优于第二名。

Conclusion: 针对特定问题的定制化改进比通用技巧更重要，在小麦分割任务中专注于茎部问题的本质分析和技术优化是取得成功的关键。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的光谱图像合成和渲染能力。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured

scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled

show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiCache是一种无需训练的自适应缓存策略，通过浅层在线探针实时获取缓存误差先验，结合动态缓存轨迹对齐技术，在扩散模型中实现高效加速和更好的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法依赖预定义经验法则或数据集级先验，在高度动态的扩散过程中泛化性有限，无法处理异常样本。

Method: 提出DiCache框架：1）在线探针分析方案利用浅层探针实时获取缓存误差先验；2）动态缓存轨迹对齐基于浅层探针特征轨迹组合多步缓存来更好近似当前特征。

Result: 在WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo视频生成和Flux图像生成等多种领先扩散模型上，DiCache相比最先进方法实现了更高效率和改进的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: DiCache通过揭示浅层特征差异变化模式与最终输出之间的强相关性，提供了一个统一的框架来解决何时缓存和如何使用缓存的问题，具有更好的自适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniGen是一个统一的图像生成框架，通过CoMoE模块聚合语义相似的patch特征并分配给专家模块，以及WeaveNet动态连接机制，有效解决了多条件图像生成中的参数冗余和计算效率问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法为每种条件类型训练单独的控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源低效使用，需要统一的框架来支持多样化条件输入并提升生成效率。

Method: 提出Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE)模块聚合语义相似patch特征，使用专家模块进行视觉表示和条件建模；设计WeaveNet动态蛇形连接机制，实现主干网络全局文本控制与条件分支细粒度控制的有效交互。

Result: 在Subjects-200K和MultiGen-20M数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在各种条件图像生成任务中 consistently 达到state-of-the-art性能，验证了其多功能性和有效性优势。

Conclusion: UniGen框架通过创新的CoMoE模块和WeaveNet机制，成功解决了多条件图像生成中的特征纠缠和计算冗余问题，提供了高效且表达力强的统一解决方案。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

### [96] [Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394)
*Nir Mazor,Tom Hope*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的医疗诊断模型，相比标准RAG能显著提升困难病例的诊断性能，但在实际应用中仍存在与理论最优性能的较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要解读医学图像进行诊断，从医学文献和医院记录中检索相关视觉信息可以提高诊断准确性。传统RAG方法中LVLM的错误信号无法传递到检索器，限制了性能提升。

Method: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的模型，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调，在医学多标签分类和视觉问答任务上进行评估。

Result: 模型在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务上达到了与医学预训练模型竞争的结果。联合检索优化显著改善了标准RAG在困难病例上的表现，但实际性能与理论最优性能仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: 虽然正确诊断经常可以通过检索到的图像实现，但实际性能与理论最优存在显著差距，前沿LVLM重排器也无法弥合这一差距，为未来方法留下了充分的改进空间。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

underwater scenes by proposing a solution based on deep learning. The proposed
method skillfully integrates two deep convolutional neural network models,
VGG19 and ResNet50, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities
to perform multi-scale and multi-level deep feature analysis of underwater

two models are effectively integrated, achieving a more comprehensive and
accurate image enhancement effect.To objectively evaluate the enhancement
effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR,
UCIQE, and UIQM to quantitatively compare images before and after enhancement
and deeply analyzes the performance of different models in different
scenarios.Furthermore, to improve the practicality and stability of the
underwater visual enhancement system, this paper also provides practical
suggestions from aspects such as model optimization, multi-model fusion, and
hardware selection, aiming to provide strong technical support for visual

TL;DR: MoCo是一个将人体视频生成解耦为结构生成和外观生成的两阶段方法，首先生成3D人体运动序列，然后在结构指导下合成外观，解决了现有方法在全身长距离运动生成中的结构一致性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型过于关注外观保真度，导致人体运动不真实且结构不连贯，同时现有数据集主要关注面部或上半身运动，限制了复杂动作的生成能力。

Method: 提出两阶段解耦方法：1）使用高效3D结构生成器从文本提示生成人体运动序列；2）在生成的结构序列指导下合成视频外观。引入Human-Aware Dynamic Control模块和密集跟踪约束来改善稀疏人体结构的细粒度控制。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoCo在生成真实且结构连贯的人体视频方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCo通过解耦结构和外观生成，结合新构建的大规模全身人体视频数据集，成功解决了复杂人体运动生成的挑战，为文本到人体视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-BayesSAM是一个高效的贝叶斯SAM框架，通过Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理和自优化KAN网络，解决了SAM在医学图像分割中的不确定性估计、计算成本和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM在医学图像分割中表现出色，但其贝叶斯适配存在三个主要问题：大型预训练模型贝叶斯微调的不稳定性、SAM巨大参数带来的高计算成本、以及黑盒设计限制可解释性。

Method: 提出E-BayesSAM框架，包含Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理(T-VBI)进行高效贝叶斯适配，以及自优化Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(SO-KAN)提升可解释性。T-VBI将输出token重新解释为动态概率权重，SO-KAN通过自监督学习改进token预测。

Result: 在五个超声数据集上的实验显示：实时推理(0.03秒/图像)、优越的分割精度(剪枝后DSC 89.0% vs 原版88.0% vs MedSAM 88.3%)、识别出四个关键决策token。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的通用性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the
internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our
efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

Conclusion: FedKLPR有效解决了联邦学习在行人重识别中的统计异构性和通信开销问题，实现了通信效率与模型精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Conclusion: TinySR证明了通过精心设计的压缩策略，可以在大幅降低计算成本和模型大小的同时，保持扩散模型在图像超分辨率任务中的性能优势。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

Conclusion: RefineEdit-Agent通过智能代理设计有效提升了编辑保真度和上下文保持能力，验证了该框架在复杂图像编辑任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

TL;DR: 本文提出了室内3D目标检测的跨数据集适应基准，分析了不同域差距对检测器的影响，并提供了改进适应性能的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测研究主要在相同分布的数据集上进行，缺乏对跨数据集适应能力的评估，需要研究检测器在不同室内场景数据集间的泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含ScanNet、SUN RGB-D、3D Front及新提出的ProcTHOR-OD和ProcFront数据集的综合基准，通过合成到真实、点云质量、布局和实例特征等不同适应场景进行实验分析。

Result: 实验揭示了不同域差距对3D目标检测器的具体影响，并提出了几种改进跨数据集适应性能的有效方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为域自适应室内3D目标检测提供了基准和基线，希望未来能开发出具有更强跨域泛化能力的检测器。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

TL;DR: ECVT是一种新颖的视频动作识别架构，利用大型视觉语言模型生成多粒度语义描述，通过双分支设计和跨模态融合机制，在ActivityNet和THUMOS14数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕捉细粒度动作、长期时间依赖和高级语义信息的局限性。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支用于时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时序子事件提示的多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块进行融合。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上平均mAP达到40.5%，在THUMOS14上mAP@0.5达到67.1%，超越了现有领先基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过利用LVLM的高级语义理解能力和多粒度语义引导，显著提升了视频时序结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，为复杂视频动作识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage multimodal prognosis model,
GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model
constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion
module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感性感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器优化中的可塑性-稳定性权衡问题，具有优异的性能表现

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

TL;DR: 结合DINO和Barlow Twins两种自监督学习方法，提出了一种在有限标签数据和计算资源下训练视觉Transformer的高效混合模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督学习中DINO对数据增强敏感和Barlow Twins需要大批量的问题，利用两种方法的互补优势来降低标注成本和计算需求

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用仅10%的标注数据进行线性探测训练

Result: 混合模型达到了与DINO相当的损失和分类精度，同时保持了强特征表示能力，注意力可视化显示语义分割能力有所提升

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签高效的替代方案

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

<details>

Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程分散且缺乏通用性，现有方法通常是针对特定解剖结构或应用的，且很少整合放射科医生依赖的语言信息。

Method: 基于60个公共数据集的大规模异构语料库训练，包含自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令调优的多阶段训练范式。

Result: 定性结果表明OmniMRI能够在单一架构中执行多种任务，包括MRI重建、分割、异常检测、诊断建议和放射报告生成。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将分散的流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一成像和临床语言的综合端到端MRI解释奠定了基础模型的发展方向。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺限制了从头训练模型的效果，需要探索最优的迁移学习策略来提升下游医学影像分类任务的性能。

Method: 使用1维卷积分类器、ResNet50预训练骨干网络和部分解冻策略，在ACL撕裂检测和乳腺结节恶性检测任务上比较RadImageNet和ImageNet预训练效果。

Result: 最佳模型在ACL撕裂检测上达到0.9969 AUC，乳腺结节恶性检测达到0.9641 AUC，性能与先前研究相当甚至更优，但未发现RadImageNet预训练的显著优势。

Conclusion: ResNet50架构配合部分解冻策略是医学影像分类的最优选择，但RadImageNet预训练并未显示出比ImageNet更好的下游任务性能。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Result: IDU管道显著减少更新时间和人力成本，为快速演变的军事场景提供经济高效的目标解决方案

Conclusion: 该方法为动态军事环境中的3D模型维护提供了有效的增量更新方案，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

Motivation: 生成驱动型世界模型由于扩散模型的迭代特性导致推理速度慢，现有加速技术直接应用会导致质量下降，需要专门针对世界模型多模态特性的加速方案

Method: 分层加速策略：浅层使用补丁刷新机制选择需要重新计算的token；深层使用线性外推方案直接估计中间特征，绕过注意力模块和前馈网络计算

Result: 实现了1.73倍的加速效果，质量退化最小，显著优于现有扩散加速方法

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过利用特征耦合现象的分层策略，在保持质量的同时大幅提升推理速度

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个不依赖物种的通用动物个体识别系统，解决现有方法在准确性和速度方面的不足，支持大规模图像数据库的快速查询匹配。

Method: 提出两种基于关键点（热点）提取和匹配的方法：1）顺序匹配查询图像与数据库图像；2）基于快速最近邻搜索的实例识别方法，采用竞争性评分机制（源自Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor算法）。

Result: 在包含1000多张图像的数据库上测试，相比已发表方法获得更高准确率，每个查询图像仅需几秒钟即可完成匹配。

Conclusion: HotSpotter算法在动物个体识别任务中表现出色，具有快速、准确、物种无关的特点，适用于大规模图像数据库的实际应用。

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

TL;DR: 基于动态权重策略的ViT多任务学习框架，通过重点关注具有临床意义的ADAS-Cog子分数，提升阻塞海默症预后模型的准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注ADAS-Cog全局分数预测，忽视了其13个子分数的预测价值。不同子分数反映不同认知域，某些对全局分数决定更具影响力，通过动态权重策略可以引导模型关注更有临床意义的认知域

Method: 提出基于权重Vision Transformer的多任务学习框架，联合预测ADAS-Cog全局分数和13个子分数。使用基线MRI扫描作为输入，ViT作为特征提取器，系统研究子分数特异损失权重对模型性能的影响

Result: 权重策略显示出群体依赖性：对具有更多异质性MRI模式的MCI受试者，强权重策略能提升性能；对变异性较低的CN受试者，中等权重更有效。统一权重会导致关键子分数利用不充分并限制模型的普适性

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种灵活、可解释的阻塞海默症预后方法，通过结合端到端的MRI基础学习和动态权重策略，有效提升了预测准确性和模型的可解释性

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

TL;DR: JCo-MVTON是一个无需掩码的多模态扩散变换器虚拟试穿框架，通过多模态条件融合和双向生成策略，解决了传统方法对掩码依赖、控制粒度不足和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统严重依赖人体掩码，对服装属性控制有限，且在真实场景中泛化能力差。本文旨在克服这些限制，开发一个更灵活、可控且泛化能力强的虚拟试穿系统。

Method: 基于多模态扩散变换器(MM-DiT)架构，将参考人物图像和目标服装图像等多模态控制信号通过专用条件路径整合到去噪过程中。采用双向生成策略构建数据集：一个管道使用基于掩码的模型生成真实参考图像，另一个对称的"Try-Off"模型以自监督方式恢复相应服装图像。

Result: 在DressCode等公共基准测试中达到最先进性能，在定量指标和人工评估中均显著优于现有方法。在真实世界应用中表现出强大的泛化能力，超越了商业系统。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态融合和数据集构建策略，成功解决了虚拟试穿领域的核心挑战，为无需掩码的高质量虚拟试穿提供了有效解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了子分数的预测价值，而子分数能捕捉特定领域的认知衰退，对早期AD检测和预后很重要

Method: 使用Vision Transformer和Swin Transformer提取MRI影像特征，与基线及6个月时的纵向临床评分融合，构建多任务学习框架预测24个月时的总分和子分数

Result: 子分数学习改善了总分预测；Q1、Q4、Q8等少数子分数对总分预测贡献最大；但部分重要子分数预测误差较高，存在模型不稳定问题，主要由临床特征主导导致

Conclusion: 研究表明子分数信息建模的价值，揭示了需要改进多模态融合和自适应损失加权来实现更平衡的学习，为构建更可解释和临床稳健的AD预测框架提供见解

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Motivation: 户外LiDAR扫描产生大规模点云数据，在应用中不可避免地会遇到训练数据之外的外点对象，需要有效的开放集分割方法

Method: 结合物体缺陷检测研究的经验，利用Mamba架构的长距离依赖处理能力和可扩展性，创建基于重建的开放集分割方法

Conclusion: 提出的Mamba架构重建方法为户外场景开放集分割提供了有效的解决方案，在大型点云数据处理方面展现出良好性能

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

TL;DR: Wound3DAssist是一个使用单目消费级视频进行3D伤口评估的实用框架，通过智能手机视频生成准确3D模型，实现非接触式自动测量，解决了传统2D方法存在的透视失真、视野有限和无法捕捉深度等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口管理是重大医疗挑战，临床评估依赖主观且耗时的手动记录方法。现有2D数字视频测量框架存在透视失真、视野有限、无法捕捉伤口深度等问题，特别是在解剖结构复杂或弯曲区域。

Method: 开发Wound3DAssist框架，从手持智能手机短视频生成准确3D模型，集成3D重建、伤口分割、组织分类和伤口周围分析到模块化工作流程中，实现非接触式自动测量。

Result: 在数字模型、硅胶模型和真实患者上评估显示，框架支持高质量伤口床可视化、毫米级精度和可靠的组织成分分析，完整评估在20分钟内完成。

Conclusion: Wound3DAssist框架展示了在真实临床环境中应用的可行性，为慢性伤口管理提供了更准确、高效的3D评估解决方案。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

Motivation: 现有少样本对象计数和检测方法将目标历历为对象类别，且通过空间压缩原型失去结构信息，无法检测非对象模式

Method: 重新实现经典模板匹配和回归方法，在冻结背榜网络上添加少量可学习卷积或投影层，保持样本的空间布局信息

Result: 在RPINE、FSCD-147和FSCD-LVIS三个数据集上超过最新方法，并在跨数据集评估中展现强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: TMR方法通过简洁的模板匹配结构有效解决少样本模式检测问题，为非对象模式检测提供了有效方案

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种基于动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合的高效视觉语言微调方法，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层特征，避免序列扩展问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接，导致输入序列长度显著增加，计算开销大。现有方法虽然缓解了序列长度问题，但往往忽略了模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息。

Method: 通过轻量级分层视觉融合器，根据LLM各层的内部表示动态选择和融合对应语义粒度的分层特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM对应层的前馈网络中。

Result: 在ScienceQA视觉问答和COCO Captions图像字幕生成等多个VL基准测试中，DEHVF比现有的参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确性，同时保持了高效的训练和推理。

Conclusion: DEHVF方法不仅避免了序列扩展问题，还动态融合了多层视觉信息，通过仅微调少量参数，实现了相同语义粒度下跨模态信息的精确对齐和互补。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Motivation: 纵向多硬化症疵容分割面临输入和输出数据不平衡的挑战，现有损失函数如Dice损失或交叉熵损失存在计算复杂度高或在其他指标上表现差的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合损失函数HyTver，设计用于减轻数据不平衡对分割性能的影响，同时保持计算效率和其他指标的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示HyTver实现了0.659的Dice分数，距离基指标也与其他常用损失函数相当，并在预训练模型上表现出良好的稳定性。

Conclusion: HyTver损失函数能够有效解决纵向多硬化症疵分割中的数据不平衡问题，在保持计算效率和多种指标性能的同时提高了分割精度。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Result: 在PC-CAC和两个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法在多个评估指标上始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于点云的管状结构重建设立了新基准，解决了临床中管状结构不连续的问题。

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理长视频时面临注意力机制二次复杂度的挑战，需要更高效的视频令牌处理方法。

Method: 提出语言引导的时间令牌剪枝(LGTTP)框架，利用查询的时间信息自适应剪枝视频令牌，在时间相关段保留更高令牌密度，可与TimeChat和LLaVA-Video等模型集成。

Conclusion: LGTTP能有效处理具有明确时间标记的查询，在通用视频理解任务中表现优异，为长视频处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超分辨率技术需要提升低分辨率图像质量，现有方法在transformer、扩散模型和GAN之间存在性能差距，需要一种综合方案来弥合这一差距

Method: 采用双分支架构：主分支使用扩散启发的transformer逐步细化潜在表示，辅助分支通过学习的潜在对比增强噪声鲁棒性，最后使用残差密集块进行重建

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，CATformer在效率和视觉图像质量方面均优于最近的transformer基和扩散启发方法

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了transformer、扩散模型和GAN方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量评估，证明该方法相比现有SOTA方法有显著改进，能够实现高质量的服装重建。

Conclusion: NGD方法有效解决了动态服装重建中的细节建模和变形处理问题，为单目视频中的高质量服装重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了长对话中多模态内容的细粒度检索问题，F2RVLM模型通过创新的训练方法显著提升了检索的语义一致性和相关性。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成方法依赖静态预收集偏好或微调，无法适应演化的用户意图，需要实时且训练免练的偏好对齐方框。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Conclusion: 该方法为少样本人类动作异常检测提供了有效的统一框架，通过创新的增广技术提升了模型的演绎性能

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Motivation: 手工Pap抽片检查耗时且容易出错，需要自动化工具提高完颈癌早期诊断的准确性和效率

Method: 使用Herlev Pap Smear数据集，建立结合U-Net分割模型和分类模型的深度学习框架，对比分割和未分割图像训练的模型性能

Result: 使用分割图像轻微提高了精度（约0.41%）和F1分数（约1.30%），显示更平衡的分类性能，但改善效果有限

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Conclusion: CMFDNet通过创新的模块设计有效解决了结肠息肉分割中的关键挑战，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析研究了CLIP预训练模型中的社会偏见如何传播到下游任务，发现偏见测量高度依赖于数据子集，预训练偏见与下游偏见之间缺乏一致性趋势，且不同CLIP模型在下游适应时表征空间趋于收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP预训练模型被广泛用于下游任务，需要深入分析其社会偏见和人类刻板印象的传播机制，了解预训练偏见如何影响视觉问答和图像描述等应用。

Method: 采用全面的实证分析方法：1) 比较全局和局部数据视图下的预训练偏见变化；2) 分析不同预训练偏见水平下预训练模型与下游任务偏见的关联性；3) 探索当前范式下不同CLIP模型在下游任务适应时的表征空间收敛现象。

Result: 研究发现：偏见测量对计算所用的数据子集高度敏感；预训练偏见与下游偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势；不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间趋于收敛，这解释了偏见传播不一致的原因。

Conclusion: 该研究为偏见行为提供了重要见解，表明当前偏见缓解实践需要改进，未来研究应关注如何更好地理解和减轻预训练模型中的社会偏见传播问题。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and

substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation

*Kai Zhao,Wubang Yuan,Alex Lingyu Hung,Dan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过简单的位置重新加权机制来减少视觉刷选中的近期偏差，提升视觉刷选效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型中的近期偏差导致图片底部区域的视觉token关注度偏高，使得视觉token刷选结果不优

Method: 提出位置重新加权视觉token刷选方法，根据token在图片中的空间位置调整关注度分数

Result: 在LVLM上的实验显示，该方法在最小计算开销下显著提升了视觉token刷选的性能

Conclusion: 该方法是一种即插即用的解决方案，可以无缝集成到现有视觉token刷选框架中

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Method: 提出UniSino基础模型，直接在投影域对CT投影数据进行标准化处理，训练框架结合了投影数据的物理特性，增强了模型的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明UniSino在单一和混合欠采样情况下都能实现优异的重建质量，在四个基准数据集的多个子任务中表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: UniSino通过在投影域直接处理数据，为CT投影数据增强提供了强大的基础模型解决方案，具有出色的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法常将静态框基图像融合技术直接应用于视频融合任务，忽视了时间依赖性，导致框间结果不一致

Method: 1. 视觉-语义交互模块（Dinov2和VGG19短缩）同时增强视觉和语义表征 2. 时间协同模块将视频退化增强任务集成到视频融合流程 3. 时间增强机制和时间损失函数确保时间一致性 4. 提出两个新的视频融合评估指标

Conclusion: 该框架通过明确的时间建模和视觉-语义协作有效解决了视频融合中的时间一致性问题，为视频融合领域提供了新的视角和技术方案

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Method: 整合软置信学习（为所有训练数据分配置信度权重）、元学习（MAML框架）和对比学习（创建判别性特征空间），通过IQR阈值量化数据不确定性，协方差正则化处理模型不确定性。

Result: 在10个工业和医疗数据集上表现优异，在7个工业基准中的6个超越现有方法，纹理丰富数据集上达到99.2% I-AUROC（DTD-Synthetic）和97.2%（BTAD），像素级定位达到96.3% P-AUROC（MVTec-AD）。

Conclusion: CoZAD框架消除了对视觉-语言对齐或模型集成的依赖，在资源受限环境中具有快速部署价值，为零样本异常检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Result: 在新建的RefTextCOD数据集上实验表明，该方法超越现有半监督方法，达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: SCOUT方法有效提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能，通过更好的未标注数据利用和文本视觉融合实现了显著改进

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型具有出色的零样本泛化能力，但提示调优的泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以防止模型过拟合，但传统标签平滑反而会削弱提示调优的泛化能力。

Method: 提出ATLaS方法：1）交替使用标准one-hot标签和标签平滑生成的软标签进行训练；2）引入两种高效的离线软标签：类间软标签(CSL)和实例软标签(ISL)，为提示调优提供类间或实例-类关系。

Result: 大量实验表明，ATLaS方法结合CSL和ISL能够持续提升提示调优的泛化性能，且与主流提示调优方法具有高度兼容性。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了标签平滑在提示调优中的负面效应，通过交替训练策略和高效软标签设计，显著提升了提示调优的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Result: 在公共基准数据集上评估，方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过类别平衡采样和软伪标签策略，可以有效解决框级主动学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中视觉token过多导致的推理效率低下问题，需要在压缩token的同时尽可能保留视觉信息

Conclusion: VISA方法通过创新的图聚合和分组选择机制，有效解决了MLLM中视觉token冗余问题，为高效多模态推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: GS-SMC框架提供了一种无需重新训练、可直接应用于不同场景的轻量级相机位姿精化方案，通过几何约束实现了更高的精度。

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Conclusion: 该方法作为一种轻量级、可解释性强且高效的解决方案，适用于静态图像和视频帧的AI生成内容检测，在自动化内容验证和数字审计领域具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniAPO是首个针对多模态自动提示优化的统一框架，通过EM式优化过程和短长期记忆机制解决视觉标记膨胀和过程级监督缺失问题，在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法主要针对纯文本输入，扩展到多模态任务（如视频-语言生成）时面临两个核心挑战：视觉标记膨胀导致上下文容量受限和反馈信号不足，以及缺乏过程级监督限制了提示优化效果。

Method: UniAPO采用EM启发的优化过程，将反馈建模和提示优化解耦，使优化更稳定和目标驱动。引入短长期记忆机制：历史反馈缓解上下文限制，历史提示为有效提示优化提供方向性指导。

Result: UniAPO在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得一致性的性能提升，建立了高效且可迁移的提示优化统一框架。

Conclusion: UniAPO成功解决了多模态自动提示优化中的关键挑战，为多模态任务提供了有效的提示优化解决方案，具有很好的通用性和迁移性。

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

TL;DR: 开发轻量级视觉语音识别架构，通过采用图像分类中的高效模型和轻量级块设计，在保持强识别性能的同时显著降低硬件资源需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VSR系统依赖深度神经网络，计算成本高且硬件需求大，限制了在资源受限的实际场景中的应用和部署

Method: 采用标准双网络设计范式，首先对图像分类中的高效模型进行基准测试，然后在时序卷积网络骨干中采用轻量级块设计，构建统一的低资源需求模型

Result: 在最大的英语单词公共数据库上的实验证明了所开发模型的有效性和实用性

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级架构能够在保持强识别性能的同时显著降低资源需求，有助于VSR系统在更广泛的实际应用中部署

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该工作有助于增强外科医生在微创手术中的空间感知能力，提高手术精度和安全性，对增强现实和导航系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)
using multiple consumer-grade cameras at different angles. To enable multimodal
analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用刚性流水线，将推理与感知解耦，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下。核心问题在于无法根据具体推理需求自适应地提取视觉信息。

Method: CAVIA采用闭环系统，推理持续指导视觉提取：1）分层推理引导精确定位到具体帧；2）跨模态语义桥接实现目标提取；3）置信度驱动的迭代合成

Result: 在EgoSchema（65.7%，+5.3%）、NExT-QA（76.1%，+2.6%）和IntentQA（73.8%，+6.9%）等基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 动态推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，证明了自适应视觉注意力机制的重要性

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Motivation: 现有的场景回归方法(如VGGT)在处理极端视角变化的图像时表现出色，但在处理大量输入图像时存在困难。

Method: 首先从锚点图像子集计算神经场景表示，然后基于该表示微调回归网络以重建所有输入图像。

Result: 该方法不仅能够高效扩展到大规模场景，还在相机姿态估计和新视角合成基准测试(TUM-RGBD、CO3Dv2、Tanks & Temples)上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon通过结合场景回归和视觉定位能力，成功解决了大规模SfM问题，并在多个基准测试中表现出色，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Motivation: 完全无监督异常检测(FUAD)在实际应用中更具实用性，但传统知识蒸馏方法在训练数据包含异常时会学习到异常的表示，导致检测性能下降。

Method: 提出跨域蒸馏(CDD)框架：1）域特定训练：将训练集划分为多个异常比例较低的域，为每个域训练特定学生模型；2）跨域知识聚合：利用域特定学生生成的伪正常特征协同指导全局学生学习跨样本的通用正常表示。

Conclusion: CDD框架有效解决了FUAD设置下知识蒸馏学习异常表示的问题，验证了该方法在完全无监督异常检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Result: PatchCoreCL表现有效，性能与任务特定模型相当，遗忘值低于1%

Conclusion: 持续学习在医学影像自适应视觉异常检测中具有可行性和巨大潜力

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Method: 提出Visual-CoG范式，包含语义推理、过程精炼和结果评估三个阶段，通过阶段感知奖励在整个图像生成流程中提供即时指导。构建了视觉认知基准VisCog-Bench来评估语义推理效果。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和VisCog-Bench基准测试中分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升，证明了Visual-CoG的优越性能。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过阶段感知奖励机制有效提升了多属性和模糊提示下的文本到图像生成能力，为自回归模型提供了更好的推理和生成指导。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

TL;DR: ArgusCogito是一个基于视觉语言模型的零样本思维链框架，通过跨模态协同和全方位推理来解决伪装目标分割问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于浅层特征表示、推理机制不足和跨模态整合薄弱，导致目标分离不完整和分割不精确的问题，需要更深入的认知能力

Method: 采用三个认知启发阶段：1)猜想阶段通过跨模态融合构建强认知先验；2)聚焦阶段进行全方位注意力扫描和聚焦推理；3)雕刻阶段通过迭代生成密集点提示来精修分割掩码

Result: 在四个伪装目标分割基准和三个医学图像分割基准上实现了最先进的性能，验证了框架的卓越效能、优越泛化能力和鲁棒性

Conclusion: ArgusCogito框架通过模仿百眼巨人的感知策略，实现了对伪装目标的深度认知和精确分割，为复杂场景下的目标分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

TL;DR: SegEarth-OV是首个用于遥感图像的无标注开放词汇分割框架，通过SimFeatUp上采样器和全局偏置缓解操作，有效利用预训练视觉语言模型的丰富语义，无需任务特定后训练即可实现精确分割。

Conclusion: SegEarth-OV框架成功解决了遥感图像开放词汇分割的关键挑战，无需标注即可实现精确分割，并通过知识蒸馏扩展到SAR等多种传感器类型，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的高效事件流模拟器，通过低SPP路径追踪加速渲染，并使用轻量级脉冲网络去噪生成逼真的事件序列，显著提高了模拟速度和真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300 FPS），远低于真实事件数据的频率，需要更高效的模拟方法。

Method: 采用低SPP路径追踪加速渲染，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络进行去噪，网络配备双极泄漏积分发放单元和双向地球移动距离损失函数来捕捉事件流的物理特性。

Result: EventTracer以约4分钟/秒的速度生成720p视频，在时空建模准确性方面表现出色，在多个下游任务中比其他模拟器更好地捕捉场景细节且更接近真实事件数据。

Conclusion: EventTracer是创建大规模事件-RGB数据集的有前途工具，能够以低成本缩小事件视觉的模拟-现实差距，推动机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等应用场景发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种原型学习和聚类方法，用于在少样本环境下发现高光谱图像中的未知类别，不仅能区分已知和未知类别，还能进一步识别未知类别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的开集HSI分类方法主要关注从已知类别中区分并拒绝未知类别样本，但无法进一步识别或发现未知类别中的具体类别

Method: 原型学习和聚类方法，使用少量标注样本推断未知类别的原型，在拒绝未知类别样本后根据其与推断原型的距离进行聚类

Result: 在四个基准HSI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在开集少样本HSI分类任务中表现出有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了开集少样本HSI分类中未知类别的发现和识别问题，相比现有方法具有更好的性能

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究统一了两种重要生成模型方法，为生成模型领域的未来研究排铺了道路

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Motivation: CAM方法在深度学习可视化中很重要，但其对不同噪声的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，需要评估各种CAM方法在不同噪声扰动下的稳定性

Method: 通过分析不同噪声类型对CAM解释的影响，评估噪声敏感性，提出包含一致性和响应性的鲁棒性度量指标，并在多个模型、扰动和数据集上进行实证评估

Result: 发现不同CAM方法对噪声敏感性存在显著差异，提出的鲁棒性度量指标能够有效捕捉CAM方法的稳定性特征

Conclusion: CAM方法对噪声的敏感性存在很大差异，提出的鲁棒性度量指标为评估CAM方法的稳定性提供了有效工具，有助于提高深度学习模型解释的可信度

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Conclusion: BRAIN方法有效解决了脑信号衰减带来的表示偏移和偏差累积问题，为视觉-脑理解模型提供了有效的持续学习解决方案

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based

boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程中的几何指导和优化循环设计，实现了高质量的手持物体3D重建，确保了手-物体交互的物理合理性

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: 提出SKD-CAG方法，通过自知识蒸馏和交叉注意力引导，选择性消除文本到图像扩散模型中文本后门触发与中毒输出的关联，在保持生成质量的同时有效防御后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型存在后门攻击漏洞，攻击者可通过注入不可察觉的文本触发器操纵模型输出。虽然分类模型中的文本后门防御已有研究，但生成模型缺乏有效的缓解技术。

Method: 使用自知识蒸馏与交叉注意力引导(SKD-CAG)，利用知识蒸馏指导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，同时通过交叉注意力机制在注意力层面消除后门影响，保持图像质量。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该方法优于现有方法，对像素后门达到100%的移除准确率，对基于风格的攻击达到93%的移除准确率，且不牺牲鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 目标性遗忘是保护生成模型安全的有前景的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的后门安全问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新的可解释性评估框架，通过识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言描述，为AI生成图像提供细粒度评估，包括提示匹配、视觉真实感、物理合理性和内容多样性四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容评估指标过于粗糙，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解。需要更细粒度的可解释评估方法。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人工评估(11,000+标注)和多模态模型分析，识别可解释视觉模式并自动生成自然语言描述。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够揭示现有指标无法发现的模型细微差异，如FLUX的物理合理性优势和SDXL-medium的内容多样性优势。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求结合，为生成AI模型用户提供了强大的模型选择、合成内容质量控制和模型改进工具，有助于建立公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的Transformer基础的2D到3D人体姿势重建方法，能够在各种检测环境下进行高精度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在无检测或部分检测环境下性能下降的问题，实现单个网络适配多种部署场景。

Method: 使用Transformer结构，给入几何先验信息（关节段长度和相机参数），通过掩码机制处理缺失的先验信息，在AMASS数据集上训练。

Result: 方法在完整和缺失先验信息的情况下都超过专家模型，平均3D关节位置误差仅36mm，计算成本极低（GPU 380μs，CPU 1800μs）。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、轻量级且适配性强的2D到3D人体姿势重建方案，适用于嵌入式设备和低功耗应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSVisLoc是一种基于3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)场景表示的视觉定位方法，通过粗匹配、精匹配和位姿细化三个步骤，实现从查询图像到3D场景的相机位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉定位方法通常需要大量参考图像或特定训练，而3DGS提供了显式的3D场景表示，但缺乏直接用于定位的有效方法。GSVisLoc旨在利用3DGS的优势，实现无需修改、重训练或额外参考图像的视觉定位。

Method: 方法包括三个步骤：1) 粗匹配：对3D高斯进行下采样和编码生成场景特征，同时对图像块编码获得图像特征；2) 精匹配：在粗匹配基础上进行更精确的特征匹配；3) 位姿细化：通过优化获得最终的精确相机位姿估计。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中，GSVisLoc表现出具有竞争力的定位性能，优于现有的基于3DGS的基线方法，并且能够有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功地将3D高斯泼溅表示应用于视觉定位任务，提供了一种无需修改场景表示或额外训练的有效定位解决方案，在多个基准测试中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉到快递削减方法仅使用单模态信息，忽视了视觉-语言任务的多模态特性，导致效果不佳

Method: 提出MMTok方法，将子集选择模型化为最大覆盖问题，同时覆盖文本到快和原始视觉到快集，并使用VLM组件提升文本到快质量

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍速度提升，保持98.7%原始性能；仅用4个视觉到快保持87.7%性能，多模态方法显著超过单模态基线

Conclusion: 多模态信息在到快选择中具有补充性，覆盖准则是高效的到快削减策略，可在保持性能的同时显著提升VLMs的推理效率

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

Motivation: 提升多模态模型的通用性、推理能力和推理效率，缩小与商业模型如GPT-5的性能差距。

Method: 采用Cascade RL（离线RL+在线RL两阶段训练）、Visual Resolution Router动态调整视觉token分辨率、Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment分离视觉编码器和语言模型部署。

Result: 相比InternVL3提升16.0%的推理性能，推理速度提升4.05倍，在MMMU和MathVista等任务上表现优异，最大模型在开源MLLM中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练框架和部署策略，显著提升了多模态模型的性能和效率，为开源社区提供了强大的多模态基础模型。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

TL;DR: ObjFiller-3D是一种新颖的3D修复方法，通过利用视频编辑模型来填补3D对象的掩码区域，解决了多视角2D图像修复中的不一致性问题，实现了更高质量和一致的3D对象补全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3D修复方法依赖于多视角2D图像修复，但不同修复视图之间的不一致性会导致模糊纹理、空间不连续性和视觉伪影，影响3D对象补全的准确性和真实感。

Method: 提出ObjFiller-3D方法，使用最先进的视频编辑模型来填补3D对象的掩码区域，分析3D和视频之间的表示差距，并引入基于参考的3D修复方法以进一步提升重建质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，ObjFiller-3D相比之前的方法产生了更忠实和精细的重建结果（PSNR 26.6 vs. NeRFiller 15.9，LPIPS 0.19 vs. Instant3dit 0.25）。

Conclusion: ObjFiller-3D在3D编辑应用中展现出强大的实际部署潜力，能够生成高质量、一致的3D对象补全结果。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Abstract: Robotic cloth manipulation suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and
shared datasets for evaluating and comparing different approaches. To address
this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a
unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air
robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition,
utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding
attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches.
Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation
trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34
garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the
trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong
achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between
competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of
independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The
associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp
selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our

Motivation: 工业密闭基础设施（如通风管道）的人工检测危险且低效，无人机是替代方案，但GPS拒止环境需要鲁棒的控制策略

Method: 使用Genesis仿真环境中的程序生成管道环境，设计奖励函数引导无人机通过航点，对碰撞施加重罚，比较PPO和SAC算法

Result: PPO学会了稳定策略，完成所有评估任务且无碰撞，轨迹平滑；SAC收敛到次优行为，仅能通过初始段后就失败

Conclusion: 在危险密集导航中，on-policy方法的训练稳定性优于off-policy算法的名义样本效率；程序生成的高保真仿真是开发和基准测试鲁棒导航策略的有效平台

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下近距离操作中，追踪器缺乏目标侧本体感知，可用相对观测稀疏、噪声大且不完整，导致因子图最大后验估计在无运动先验时欠约束，目标状态间连接弱且方向易漂移。

Conclusion: 该方法依赖于标准李群原语，可在不同状态流形和感知模态间移植，为水下6-DoF运动估计提供了有效的正则化解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating a target's 6-DoF motion in underwater proximity operations is
difficult because the chaser lacks target-side proprioception and the available
relative observations are sparse, noisy, and often partial (e.g., Ultra-Short
Baseline (USBL) positions). Without a motion prior, factor-graph maximum a
posteriori estimation is underconstrained: consecutive target states are weakly
linked and orientation can drift. We propose a generalized constant-twist
motion prior defined on the tangent space of Lie groups that enforces
temporally consistent trajectories across all degrees of freedom; in SE(3) it
couples translation and rotation in the body frame. We present a ternary factor
and derive its closed-form Jacobians based on standard Lie group operations,
enabling drop-in use for trajectories on arbitrary Lie groups. We evaluate two
deployment modes: (A) an SE(3)-only representation that regularizes orientation
even when only position is measured, and (B) a mode with boundary factors that
switches the target representation between SE(3) and 3D position while applying
the same generalized constant-twist prior across representation changes.
Validation on a real-world dynamic docking scenario dataset shows consistent
ego-target trajectory estimation through USBL-only and optical relative
measurement segments with an improved relative tracking accuracy compared to
the noisy measurements to the target. Because the construction relies on
standard Lie group primitives, it is portable across state manifolds and
sensing modalities.

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world
sensory constraints. The video visualization results can be found on the

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: HDSim框架通过认知理论与LLM结合，成功解决了交通仿真的真实性和多样性问题，为自动驾驶系统评估提供了更可靠的仿真环境

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了特征匹配和几何匹配的优势，在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于实时应用场景

Abstract: Rigid registration, aiming to estimate a rigid transformation to align source
and target data, play a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and 3D
reconstruction. However, noisy, partially overlapping data and the need for
real-time processing pose major challenges for rigid registration. Considering
that feature-based matching can handle large transformation differences but
suffers from limited accuracy, while local geometry-based matching can achieve
fine-grained local alignment but relies heavily on a good initial
transformation, we propose a novel dual-space paradigm to fully leverage the
strengths of both approaches. First, we introduce an efficient filtering
mechanism that incorporates a computationally lightweight single-point RANSAC
algorithm followed by a refinement module to eliminate unreliable feature-based
correspondences. Subsequently, we treat filtered correspondences as anchor
points, extract geometric proxies, and formulates an effective objective
function with a tailored solver to estimate the transformation. Experiments
verify our method's effectiveness, as shown by achieving up to a 32x CPU-time
speedup over MAC on KITTI with comparable accuracy.

Abstract: As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming
increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing
path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.
The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory
planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves
maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,
particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based
rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above
challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time
efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance
framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned
trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal
smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the
proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path
adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to
maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility
of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time
efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other
iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the
proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,
demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.

Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing
interest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the
challenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to
study it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a
design space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational
budget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for
studying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to
exhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze
how evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design
space. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a
better understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization
algorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.
This investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently
find near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies
that are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the
algorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the
morphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms
regularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,
as a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution. Our work
provides the most concrete demonstration of the challenges of evolutionary
brain-body co-optimization. Our findings ground the trends in the literature
and provide valuable insights for future work.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an
essential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it
difficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In
contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent
behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated
aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent
behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of
constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent
behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer.
Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined
to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit
zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an
MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer
to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior
as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image
classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that
this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into
different models of intelligence.

Abstract: Grasp synthesis is a fundamental task in robotic manipulation which usually
has multiple feasible solutions. Multimodal grasp synthesis seeks to generate
diverse sets of stable grasps conditioned on object geometry, making the robust
learning of geometric features crucial for success. To address this challenge,
we propose a framework for learning multimodal grasp distributions that
leverages variational shape inference to enhance robustness against shape noise
and measurement sparsity. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder
for shape inference using implicit neural representations, and then uses these
learned geometric features to guide a diffusion model for grasp synthesis on
the SE(3) manifold. Additionally, we introduce a test-time grasp optimization
technique that can be integrated as a plugin to further enhance grasping
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our shape inference for
grasp synthesis formulation outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal grasp
synthesis methods on the ACRONYM dataset by 6.3%, while demonstrating
robustness to deterioration in point cloud density compared to other
approaches. Furthermore, our trained model achieves zero-shot transfer to
real-world manipulation of household objects, generating 34% more successful
grasps than baselines despite measurement noise and point cloud calibration
errors.

this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 开发了一个开源ROS包，用于Gazebo模拟器中从RGB相机生成事件流，并研究了基于事件的机器人策略在导航和操作任务中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有微秒级延迟、高动态范围和低功耗等优势，适合在运动模糊、遮挡和光照变化等挑战性条件下进行实时机器人感知，但主流机器人模拟器中缺乏合成事件视觉的模拟设置，阻碍了事件驱动方法在机器人操作和导航任务中的评估。

Method: 提出了一个开源的、用户友好的v2e ROS包，用于Gazebo模拟器，能够从RGB相机流无缝生成事件流。使用该包研究基于事件的机器人策略，通过行为克隆训练基于Transformer的策略，并在移动机器人目标跟随和机械臂目标检测与抓取两个代表性场景中与基于RGB的策略进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，事件引导的策略在各种操作条件下始终具有竞争优势，突显了事件驱动感知在改善实时机器人导航和操作方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为事件相机更广泛地集成到机器人策略学习中提供了基础，展示了事件驱动感知在机器人应用中的价值和前景。

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

Motivation: 解决现有开源双足机器人3D打印制造导致的尺寸限制和结构脆弱问题，以及金属机器人组件过多、组装困难的问题。

Method: 采用电商平台可获取的零件，使用钣金焊接技术将复杂几何结构集成到单个零件中，减少组件数量；通过仿真中的强化学习和Sim-to-Real迁移实现行走控制。

Result: 开发出MEVITA双足机器人，在各种环境中表现出稳健的行走行为，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MEVITA提供了一个易于组装、结构坚固的开源双足机器人平台，所有硬件、软件和训练环境都已开源，促进了双足机器人技术的普及和发展。

Abstract: Various bipedal robots have been developed to date, and in recent years,
there has been a growing trend toward releasing these robots as open-source
platforms. This shift is fostering an environment in which anyone can freely
develop bipedal robots and share their knowledge, rather than relying solely on
commercial products. However, most existing open-source bipedal robots are
designed to be fabricated using 3D printers, which limits their scalability in
size and often results in fragile structures. On the other hand, some
metal-based bipedal robots have been developed, but they typically involve a
large number of components, making assembly difficult, and in some cases, the
parts themselves are not readily available through e-commerce platforms. To
address these issues, we developed MEVITA, an open-source bipedal robot that
can be built entirely from components available via e-commerce. Aiming for the
minimal viable configuration for a bipedal robot, we utilized sheet metal
welding to integrate complex geometries into single parts, thereby
significantly reducing the number of components and enabling easy assembly for
anyone. Through reinforcement learning in simulation and Sim-to-Real transfer,
we demonstrated robust walking behaviors across various environments,
confirming the effectiveness of our approach. All hardware, software, and
training environments can be obtained from https://github.com/haraduka/mevita .

Conclusion: 这些限制对人机交互有严重影响，识别错误可能干扰任务执行、破坏用户信任并带来安全风险

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly
available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,
accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,
and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These
limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can
interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.

TL;DR: 提出FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，动态调整轨迹预测的时间步长，通过自适应预测模块和动态解码器实现灵活准确的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轨迹预测模型使用固定长度输出，无法适应动态现实场景的需求，需要开发能够根据上下文条件动态调整预测步长的解决方案。

Method: 设计FSN框架，包含预训练的自适应预测模块(APM)评估和动态调整输出步长，动态解码器(DD)确保即插即用，以及结合Fréchet距离和预测步长长度的评分机制。

Result: 在Argoverse和INTERACTION等基准数据集上的大量实验证明了FSN框架的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: FSN框架通过动态调整预测步长，在保持预测精度的同时提高了适应性，为自动驾驶和机器人等领域的轨迹预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

### [219] [Effect of Performance Feedback Timing on Motor Learning for a Surgical Training Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17830)
*Mary Kate Gale,Kailana Baker-Matsuoka,Ilana Nisky,Allison Okamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 实时多感官（触觉和视觉）错误反馈相比任务回放反馈或无反馈，能更好地提高机器人辅助微创手术培训中的学习效果，特别是在环的方向控制和弯曲路径的位置精度方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助微创手术已成为多种手术的金标准，但最佳培训方法尚不明确。研究假设实时错误反馈比任务后反馈能更快提高学习速度和减少错误。

Method: 42名手术新手学习虚拟环线任务，分为三组：实时错误反馈组、任务回放错误反馈组、无错误反馈组，使用多感官（触觉和视觉）提示。

Result: 实时反馈组在环的方向控制上表现最佳；回放反馈组在直线路径段优于无反馈组；实时反馈组在弯曲路径段的位置精度最高；各组在整体位置精度上无显著差异。

Conclusion: 实时多感官错误反馈比回放反馈或无反馈能更有效地改善虚拟手术任务的学习效果，这种新颖培训方法可能使手术学员以更快速度和更高准确性发展技能。

Abstract: Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the
gold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of
training surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather
than post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce
errors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the
ring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the
impact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three
groups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and
(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on
the accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who
received real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.
Additionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed
participants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during
long, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between
groups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time
feedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved
path sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error
feedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error
feedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work
demonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to
better training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task
completion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to
develop skills with greater speed and accuracy.

TL;DR: CubeDN是一个专为无人机3D检测设计的单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，通过双雷达配置和深度学习管道解决毫米波雷达在高度测量方面的局限性，实现了分米级跟踪精度和实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机的广泛应用，需要确保安全性和安全性。光学传感器在恶劣光照和环境条件下性能下降，而现有毫米波雷达系统主要专注于2D道路用户检测，缺乏对无人机3D检测所需的高度测量能力。

Method: 提出CubeDN单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，采用双雷达配置来克服高度分辨率差的问题，使用新颖的深度学习管道同时实现检测、定位和分类功能。

Result: 系统能够同时检测和分类两种尺寸的无人机，在较近距离实现分米级跟踪精度，整体平均精度(AP)达到95%，平均召回率(AR)达到85%，数据处理和推理速度为10Hz。

Conclusion: CubeDN通过创新的双雷达配置和深度学习架构，成功解决了毫米波雷达在无人机3D检测中的高度测量挑战，具备高精度和实时处理能力，非常适合实际应用。

Abstract: As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure
safety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone
detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR
are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under
adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated
interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave
(mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has
predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems
demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing
capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To
address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object
detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes
challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar
configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects,
localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level
tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall $95\%$ average precision (AP)
and $85\%$ average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing
and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了任务/指令依赖的affordance概念，构建了包含1.5万个物体-指令-动作三元组的数据集，并开发了基于大型多模态模型的"搜索验证"推理流程来预测affordance。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有affordance研究大多忽视了任务/指令依赖性，即同一物体在不同指令下会产生不同的操作区域和方向，这限制了智能机器人的物体操作能力。

Method: 构建了包含1.5万个egocentric视角的三元组数据集；提出了"search against verifiers"推理流程，让大型多模态模型迭代预测affordance并在每一步进行自我验证。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅解锁了指令导向的affordance预测能力，而且在广泛任务上取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 任务/指令依赖的affordance概念是重要的，通过大型多模态模型的推理流程可以有效实现指令导向的affordance预测，为智能机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and external
monitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novel
AI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies and
solutions that optimize perception and experience on-board. Internal monitoring
system relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifying
driver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in addition
a large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoring
system includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and perform
thermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand,
external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle,
through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that
performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D
point clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context of
EU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed on
a real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation and

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires a seamless integration of
perception and decision making under uncertain conditions. Although computer
vision (CV) models such as YOLO achieve high accuracy in detecting traffic
signs and obstacles, their performance degrades in drift scenarios caused by
weather variations or unseen objects. This work presents a simulated autonomous
driving system that combines a context aware CV model with adaptive control
using the ADORE framework. The CARLA simulator was integrated with ADORE via
the ROS bridge, allowing real-time communication between perception, decision,
and control modules. A simulated test case was designed in both clear and drift
weather conditions to demonstrate the robust detection performance of the
perception model while ADORE successfully adapted vehicle behavior to speed
limits and obstacles with low response latency. The findings highlight the
potential of coupling deep learning-based perception with rule-based adaptive
decision making to improve automotive safety critical system.

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖于特定设备，可部署于任何具备全身触觉感知能力的平台，在农业摘果等视觉挑战场景中具有应用潜力

Abstract: Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using
visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only
secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of
searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying
on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the
complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search
is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete
robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector
equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in
simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be
located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real
robot for one object was 85.7\% with failures mainly while grasping specific
objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a
baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show
locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not
restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the
ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds
promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception
(due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or
vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

Motivation: 移动机器人遥操作中的通信延迟严重影响人机协作，但之前没有研究探索延迟对人类操作表现和神经认知的影响，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用人在环实验，招募10名参与者，在0-500ms延迟范围内以100ms为增量进行测试，同时采集脑电图(EEG)和机器人行为数据。

Result: 行为分析显示200-300ms延迟时性能显著下降；EEG分析发现前额θ/β波段和顶叶α波段功率具有显著延迟依赖性；识别出100-200ms的早期感知窗口；400ms以上时所有特征达到平台期。

Conclusion: 研究首次提供了人类在遥操作任务中的感知和认知延迟阈值的证据，为延迟补偿策略的设计提供了关键的神经认知学见解。

Abstract: Communication delays in mobile robot teleoperation adversely affect
human-machine collaboration. Understanding delay effects on human operational
performance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However,
no previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a
human-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating
electroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays
(0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects.
Behavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms
delays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers
features with significant delay dependence: frontal $\theta/\beta$-band and
parietal $\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms)
for early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first
exhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features
plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at
physiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual
and cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering
critical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation
strategies.

controlled joint behavior with low torques and symmetric tracking, accurate
foot placement within kinematic constraints despite phase-transition
perturbations, and underactuated degree-of-freedom stability without
divergence. Energy level analysis reveals that legs provide primary propulsion,
while the thrusters enable additional aerial phase control. The analysis
identifies critical body-leg coupling dynamics during aerial phases that
require phase-specific control strategies. Consistent repeatability and
symmetry across experiments validate the robustness of the hybrid actuation
approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DANCeRS是一个统一的分布式算法，使用高斯置信传播在离散和连续决策空间中实现群体共识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将离散和连续决策空间的共识作为不同问题处理，需要一种统一的分布式算法来解决群体机器人系统中的共识问题

Method: 将群体表示为因子图，使用高斯置信传播(GBP)进行纯对等消息传递，确保在动态环境中的可扩展性和鲁棒性

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在路径规划、碰撞避障的形状形成和离散决策共识方面具有出色的可扩展性和效率

Conclusion: DANCeRS为需要分布式共识的多机器人系统提供了一个有前景的统一解决方案，能够同时处理离散和连续决策问题

Abstract: Robot swarms require cohesive collective behaviour to address diverse
challenges, including shape formation and decision-making. Existing approaches
often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct
problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging
Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By
representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and
robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message
passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two
applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour
whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path
planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we
show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a
consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our
method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these
problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring
distributed consensus. We encourage the reader to see the supplementary video
demo.

*Zipeng Fang,Yanbo Wang,Lei Zhao,Weidong Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 多模态自监督学习框架，通过视觉基础模型生成可通行性标签，并使用双流网络合并多模态数据，在多种环境下实现了更高的可通行性估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在捕捉非可通行区域特征方面表现不佳，且大多数工作只关注单一模态，忽视了多模态数据的互补优势。

Method: 提出了一种多模态自监督框架：1）使用踏足迹、LiDAR和摄像头数据作为提示，通过视觉基础模型生成统考语义和几何线索的可通行性标签；2）训练双流网络来联合学习不同模态；3）结合稀疏LiDAR监督来减少假标签的噪声。

Result: 在城市、野外和校园环境下进行了大量实验，自动标注方法在多种数据集上一致达到约88%的IoU。与现有最佳自监督方法相比，可通行性估计网络在所有评估数据集上都实现了更高的IoU，提高了1.6-3.5%。

Conclusion: 该多模态框架通过结合多种感知模态和自动标注技术，有效提升了机器人在多样化环境中的可通行性估计能力。

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SafeBimanual是一个测试时轨迹优化框架，通过安全约束和视觉语言模型调度，提升双手机器人操作的安全性和成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散策略的双手机器人操作忽视了物理安全约束，可能导致危险行为和损坏

Method: 设计多样化安全约束成本函数，通过引导扩散去噪采样优化轨迹，利用VLM动态调度约束条件

Result: 在模拟任务中成功率提升13.7%，不安全交互减少18.8%；真实任务中成功率提升32.5%

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升双手机器人操作的安全性和性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.

TL;DR: FlowVLA通过引入视觉思维链(Visual CoT)框架，在预测未来帧之前先推理光流运动表示，解决了传统VLA模型在物理推理中的问题，实现了更好的视觉预测和策略学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于下一帧预测的VLA模型将静态外观与动态运动纠缠在一起，导致不合理的视觉预测和低效的策略学习，需要更好的物理推理方法。

Method: 提出Visual CoT框架，在单个自回归Transformer中实现"当前帧→光流→下一帧"的推理过程，通过中间光流表示编码运动动力学。

Result: 在机器人操作基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了样本效率，产生了更连贯的视觉预测。

Conclusion: FlowVLA为世界建模提供了更原则性的基础，通过解耦动力学学习改善了视觉语言动作模型的性能。

Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on an internal world model
trained via next-frame prediction. This approach, however, struggles with
physical reasoning as it entangles static appearance with dynamic motion, often
resulting in implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To
address these limitations, we introduce the Visual Chain of Thought (Visual
CoT): a pre-training framework that encourages a model to reason about how a
scene evolves before predicting what it will look like. We instantiate this
principle in FlowVLA, which predicts a future frame ($v_{t+1}$) only after
generating an intermediate optical flow representation ($f_t$) that encodes
motion dynamics. This ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'' reasoning
process is implemented within a single autoregressive Transformer, guiding the
model to learn disentangled dynamics. As a result, FlowVLA produces coherent
visual predictions and facilitates more efficient policy learning. Experiments
on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a
more principled foundation for world modeling. Project page:

Motivation: 传统基于静态启发式和目录估算的方法难以适应动态生产环境，导致解决方案次优和浪费增加，需要更智能的自适应方法。

Method: 量子启发的深度强化学习框架，集成LSTM网络捕捉序列依赖关系，使用Ornstein-Uhlenbeck噪声促进平滑探索和快速收敛。

Result: 经过1000轮训练，平均奖励0.81(±0.03)，预测损失降至0.15(±0.02)，相比传统方法节省高达13%的布料成本，统计评估显示低变异性和稳定收敛。

Conclusion: 尽管模拟模型做了简化假设，但结果证明了该可扩展自适应框架在提升制造效率方面的潜力，为COP优化未来创新铺平道路。

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry,
directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional
methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle
to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions
and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep
Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is
designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of
quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory
in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in
facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over
1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81
(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A
comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost
savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical
evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact
that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these
promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive
framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future
innovations in COP optimization.

Motivation: 挑战当前架构复杂化的趋势，证明在数据有限的科学领域中，精心设计的简单架构比容易过拟合的复杂替代方案更有效。

Method: 使用统一的transformer架构，将晶格和原子属性视为单一相互依赖系统，结合基于元素周期表的原子表示和平衡训练策略。

Result: 在MP-20数据集上达到9.62% SUN率（稳定、独特、新颖），显著优于FlowMM（4.38%）和MatterGen（3.42%），生成63.28%独特新颖结构且保持相当的稳定性。

Conclusion: 架构简单性在材料发现中可能比复杂性更有效，特别是在数据有限的科学领域中，精心设计的简单架构能够避免过拟合问题。

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的数据流异常检测方法DyCF和DyCG，基于克里斯托菲尔函数理论，解决了参数调整问题和内存消耗挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据流异常检测面临分布非稳定性和数据量快速增长的挑战，现有方法常常缺乏直观的参数化方法。

Method: DyCF基于克里斯托菱尔函数和正交多项式理论，DyCG利用克里斯托菱尔函数的增长特性，无需调整参数。两种方法都基于代数框架，具有低维处理和无内存成本维护数据历史的特性。

Result: 对比实验显示DyCF在执行时间和内存使用方面超过优化调参的现有方法，性能更优。DyCG性能略差但优势在于完全无需参数调整。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效且参数友好的数据流异常检测方案，尤其是DyCF方法在性能和可用性方面都显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,
particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The
ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data
quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents
challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the
ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to
tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward
parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:
DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of
approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the
growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning
parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic
framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific
focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history
without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and
state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial
data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,
offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG
performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning
at all.

Motivation: 现有位置预测方法主要依赖历史轨迹数据，但忽略了未来时空上下文的重要性，而未来时空信息（如旅行时间和距离）对预测下一位置具有关键提示作用。

Method: STRelay以中继方式建模未来时空上下文，将其与基础位置预测模型编码的历史表示相结合，通过多任务学习同时预测下一时间间隔、移动距离间隔和最终位置。

Result: 在四个真实轨迹数据集上与四种最先进的基础模型集成，STRelay将预测性能一致提升了3.19%-11.56%，特别对娱乐相关地点和长途旅行用户群体效果显著。

Conclusion: 未来时空上下文对非日常例行活动（如娱乐）具有重要价值，与擅长建模日常规律模式的基础模型形成互补，有效提升了位置预测的整体性能。

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling,
enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management.
Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to
train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they
often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are
highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time
and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting
the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay},
a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future
spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of
different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future
spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated
with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction
model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time
interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We
evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base
models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay
consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by
3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts
are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user
groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such
non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is
indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at
modeling regular daily routine patterns.

Conclusion: RAST框架通过集成检索增强机制与时空建模，有效提升了交通预测的性能，为解决复杂时空依赖和细粒度预测问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation
systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced
Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have
achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:
(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal
dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal
points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates
retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these
challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder
and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and
construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval
Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;
and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained
STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world
traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST
achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where
memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory
mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,
leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these
methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is
critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with
an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.
Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,
propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and
develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework
empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in
specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct
comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research
community in this area, we release our project at

Motivation: 地下形势中的断层会强烈影响流体流动，特别是在地质碳存存中可能作为CO2泄漏途径，需要高效准确的预测模型来评估风险和优化监测策略。

Method: 发展了新的循环变化器U-Net代模型，基于4000个随机采样的模拟结果进行训练，考虑地质形态的层次不确定性和断层透氧性的不确定性。

Result: 模型比之前的循环殊忍U-Net更准确，在不同泄漏场景下保持精度，能够有效进行全局敏感性分析和层次Markov链数据同化。

Conclusion: 在所有三个水层中测量压力和饱和度可显著降低CO2泄漏风险的不确定性，为地质碳存存监测策略提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for
large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can
strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent
transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure
and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The
geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),
surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.
The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The
heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by
hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,
mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell
properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also
treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)
4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is
more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains
accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is
then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical
Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different
monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed
data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true
models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction
achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D
saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring
pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

Abstract: The persistent challenge of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks has
motivated extensive research in continual learning . This work presents a novel

Comprehensive evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks including

improvements over existing approaches such as Variational Continual Learning
and Elastic Weight Consolidation . The asymmetric variance penalty mechanism
proves particularly effective in maintaining knowledge across sequential tasks
while improving model accuracy. Experimental results show our approach not only
boosts immediate task performance but also significantly mitigates knowledge
degradation over time, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks

Conclusion: UEM框架有效解决了传统GSO的局限性，提供了更灵活的图信号处理工具，在异常检测等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data
structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators
(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in
modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to
represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the
extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through
parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph
structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of
the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue
monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier
transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties
to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based
methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across
varying network topologies.

this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting
of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity
Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN
explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a
fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order
Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific
features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation
stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared
across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a
multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained
knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting
and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a
decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision
boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP
benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN
achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to
state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos,
MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot
capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,
and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from
variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when
deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of
statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including
bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval
construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to
improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load
Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids
consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.
Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap
aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects
systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal
coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results
indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models
yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for
real-world time series applications.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied
architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable
models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density
estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a
unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods
within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models
such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item
response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential
extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical
Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep
PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential
PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative
Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a
common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference
strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We
offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical
foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by
grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted
increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as
domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training
typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on
edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To
address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),
named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting
dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling
in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based
methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,
NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method
and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the
emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,
target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and
leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of
examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose
AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided
optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative
training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the
edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and
entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and
time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Result: 能够从稀疏壁面压力输入重建512Hz高频湍流尾流场，实现了时空解耦的流场重建

Conclusion: LatentFlow为数据受限的实验环境提供了可扩展且鲁棒的高频湍流尾流重建解决方案

Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent
wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a
significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In
contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall
pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,
we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which
reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing
synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during
training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first
stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder
($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the
intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized
low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling
reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once
trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure
inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the
$p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics
from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust
solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in
data-constrained experimental settings.

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning
architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements
inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a
grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate
gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are
maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is
dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs
are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized
sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed
through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet
mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable
task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the
model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks.
Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted
by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of
stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on
standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art
results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

Motivation: 远程病人监测中，心率受运动影响显著，但现有模型少有综合运动上下文信息，导致心率变化评估困难

Conclusion: 该模型是一种实用有效的工具，能够支持医疗服务提供者和远程病人监测系统，通过综合运动上下文显著提升了心率预测的准确性和可解释性

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents
challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift,
and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address
these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these
methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced
datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we
propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when
pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based
pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for
underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable
pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also
introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process,
reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both
accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Motivation: 当前Transformer模型的训练优化主要集中在网络结构修改或优化器调整，缺乏对权重模式的系统性优化。权重模式指的是神经网络中权重参数的分布和相对大小。

Method: 提出WISCA权重缩放方法，通过重新调整权重而保持模型输出不变，间接优化模型的训练轨迹。

Result: 实验结果显示WISCA显著提升了收敛质量（通过泛化能力和损失减少来衡量），尤其是在使用GQA架构的LLM和LoRA细调任务中。在多种架构上实现了零射验证任务平均5.6%的收益和训练困惑度平均2.12%的减少。

Conclusion: WISCA方法通过系统性优化权重模式，在不改变网络结构的情况下有效提升了Transformer模型的训练效果和模型质量。

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances
in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.
However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns
during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative
magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we
propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and
model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without
changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model
outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.
Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality
(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in
LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning
tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation
tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple
architectures.

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in
small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining
distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a
natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore,
we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend
\textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through
Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we
explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline
distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we
specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data.
By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and
online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the
issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and
complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the
distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we
design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses
between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

Conclusion: 将功能信息损失作为可学习信号的处理方式是一种高效的压缩范式，能够创建更小更高效的LLM，提升实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques
are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained
environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating
weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix
reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's
functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing
methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during
compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank
Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a
primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank
corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual
error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and
Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to
51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,
consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows
that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly
effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of
significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and
practical deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent
transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the
Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a
unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively
captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on
separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly
models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically
weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its
capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into
neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling
effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive
experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction
horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt
to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains
a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional,
correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic
uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that
preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this
work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a
multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions
over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.
Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means
and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We
leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network
training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization
strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between
image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the
super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional
loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit
correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all
without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a
surface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to
uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at
similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric
relationships. We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear
subspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace
dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports
set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum
(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical
formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth
relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of
both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on
natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass
bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that

TL;DR: 提出辅助方程神经网络方法(AENNM)，结合神经网络和辅助方程法求解非线性偏微分方程，通过新激活函数提高计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合神经网络的强大近似能力和符号计算的高精度优势，为求解非线性偏微分方程提供新方法。

Conclusion: AENNM为求解非线性偏微分方程提供了新的方法论框架，在科学和工程领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks
method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks
(NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method
is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions
of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between
differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong
approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic
computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and
accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,
three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution
equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional
Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by
setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs
models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we
derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are
expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and
rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and
density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the
obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for
addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering
fields.

TL;DR: ALSO（自适应损失缩放优化器）是一种新的DRO算法，能够处理样本组权重分配，在多种深度学习任务中优于传统优化器和现有DRO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRO方法无法满足现代深度学习实践的需求，缺乏自适应性和处理随机梯度的能力，同时需要支持样本组级别的权重分配。

Method: 提出ALSO算法，通过修改DRO目标函数，支持自适应权重分配和样本组处理，并证明了在非凸目标下的收敛性。

Result: 在从表格深度学习到分割学习等多种任务中，ALSO在性能上超越了传统优化器和现有DRO方法。

Conclusion: ALSO成功弥合了DRO与现代深度学习实践之间的差距，为分布鲁棒优化提供了实用的自适应解决方案。

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training
samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns
importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists
between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity
and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate
superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should
allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of
objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge
this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer
$\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can
handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our
proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL
models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular
DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional
optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Conclusion: 深度学习为Lyapunov函数构造提供了有效的自动化解决方案，扩展了传统方法的适用范围

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian
models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and
analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this
process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from
first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be
adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions.
While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains,
it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains
on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Conclusion: 小模型可以可靠地支撑大模型，释放潜在能力同时避免强教师可能引入的错误提示，为高效安全的LLM提示优化提供了可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many
applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt
engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that
enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work,
WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in
settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using
reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively
improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains
across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on
MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and
Llama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold
larger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts
that stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution
for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

Abstract: Taxonomic classification in biodiversity research involves organizing
biological specimens into structured hierarchies based on evidence, which can
come from multiple modalities such as images and genetic information. We
investigate whether hyperbolic networks can provide a better embedding space
for such hierarchical models. Our method embeds multimodal inputs into a shared
hyperbolic space using contrastive and a novel stacked entailment-based
objective. Experiments on the BIOSCAN-1M dataset show that hyperbolic embedding
achieves competitive performance with Euclidean baselines, and outperforms all
other models on unseen species classification using DNA barcodes. However,
fine-grained classification and open-world generalization remain challenging.
Our framework offers a structure-aware foundation for biodiversity modelling,

Result: 模型在单步状态预测上准确率高，但多步推理性能急剧下降；增加模型深度对序列计算至关重要；通过循环机制、内存扩展和测试时计算扩展能显著提升推理能力

Conclusion: 多步推理需要更深的模型架构和计算扩展，单纯的单步预测能力不足以支持复杂的多步推理任务

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding
how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In
this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect
model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework.
By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for
random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most
neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models
achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines
sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model
depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an
extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time
compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: FAIRWELL方法能够有效学习公平的多模态表示，在保持分类性能的同时显著提升预测任务的公平性

Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine
learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: DR-CircuitGNN有效解决了HGNN在EDA电路图中的计算瓶颈，显著提升训练速度且保持精度

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to
increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as
circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation
for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA
designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA
circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric
features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of
even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial
module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance
bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design
by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels
during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on
EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose
a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by
concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU
initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our
experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,
medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup
compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On
full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables
up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with
negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

Conclusion: 这些发现为在构建大规模神经数据基础模型时结合图基几何约束提供了动力和方向，有助于提高模型的可解释性和表征能力。

Abstract: Inferring temporal interaction graphs and higher-order structure from neural
signals is a key problem in building generative models for systems
neuroscience. Foundation models for large-scale neural data represent shared
latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent
graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved.
Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals.
By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known
ground-truth connectivity, we evaluate several hypotheses for explaining
learned model weights. We discover modest alignment between extracted network
representations and the underlying directed graphs and strong alignment in the
co-input graph representations. These findings motivate paths towards
incorporating graph-based geometric constraints in the construction of
large-scale foundation models for neural data.

Motivation: 量化虽然在实际部署中很实用，但其对模型内部表示的影响研究不足，需要评估量化模型的可靠性

Method: 使用多种可解释性技术分析多个LLM在4位和8位量化下的模型和神经元行为

Result: 量化对模型校准影响较小；死亡神经元数量不受量化影响；不同模型的神经元贡献模式不同；量化对神经元冗余的影响因模型而异

Conclusion: 量化的影响因模型和任务而异，但没有观察到剧烈变化，量化仍可作为可靠的模型压缩技术

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in
resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal
representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability
of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability
techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior.
We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings
reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.
Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,
those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent
regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we
observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,
whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The
effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our
findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks,
however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of
quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

Conclusion: Anchor-MoE是一个理论上有保障、实证表现优异的概率回归模型，能够有效处理回归不确定性，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.
We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles
both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned
gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf
point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected
into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and
a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network
experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive
variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint
calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point
accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of
order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded
overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate
$O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test
generalization gap scales as
$\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$
and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,
$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is
absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous
$\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test
NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE
consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;
on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression
results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family
of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty
quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that
predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution
and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations
for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates
uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by
solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling
state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation
adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled
uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations
naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple
domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,
time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust
trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine
learning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The
observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in
constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve
into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been
overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the
information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To
delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution
and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for
attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also
introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and
complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide
new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including
gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine
learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations
when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic
manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer
architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld
quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior
performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding
error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD
detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,
triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling
requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously
evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution
performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios
demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction
capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical
challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters
frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied
artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time
adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a
crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial
environment.

the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical
framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary
dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to
learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it
into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical
information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics
and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain
resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better
results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and
effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of
the industry.

*Guangyu Nie,Yang Jiao,Yi Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Neural Contrast Expansion (NCE)方法，结合强对比展开理论和神经网络，为复合材料有效性质预测提供既高效又可解释的解决方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，基于PDE求解的方法运行成本高但可解释性好，而数据驱动方法成本低但可解释性差。需要一种既能保持成本效益又能提供可解释敏感性信息的方法

Method: 基于强对比展开(SCE)形式，提出NCE架构从结构-性质数据中学习替代PDE核。该方法仅需要宏观性质测量，无需PDE解场测量

Result: 在静态传导和电磁波传播案例中，NCE模型显示出准确且有洞察力的敏感性信息，对材料设计有用

Conclusion: NCE方法为线性自伴PDE控制的复合材料性质预测提供了成本效益高且可解释的解决方案，特别适用于有限尺寸的实际材料样本

Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble
average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels
from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave
propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful
sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE
kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE
solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements
that are more accessible in material development contexts.

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: 深度集成方法在不确定性量化方面表现稳健且计算效率高，为神经网络湍流闭合模型的实用化提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,
despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is
significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step

TL;DR: Tri-Accel是一个统一的优化框架，通过协同适配三种加速策略（自适应精度更新、稀疏二阶信号、内存弹性批次缩放）来减少神经网络训练的时间和内存消耗，同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在优化成本（GPU内存和计算时间）方面面临瓶颈，现有加速技术通常孤立使用，需要统一的协同优化方案。

Method: 提出Tri-Accel框架，包含：(1)基于曲率和梯度方差动态分配混合精度级别的精度自适应更新；(2)利用Hessian/Fisher稀疏模式指导精度和步长决策的稀疏二阶信号；(3)根据VRAM可用性实时调整批次大小的内存弹性批次缩放。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，ResNet-18和EfficientNet-B0的训练时间减少9.9%，内存使用降低13.3%，准确率比FP32基线提高1.1个百分点。与静态混合精度训练相比，在保持78.1%准确率的同时将内存占用从0.35GB降至0.31GB。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了算法自适应性和硬件感知相结合如何提高资源受限环境下的可扩展性，为边缘设备和成本敏感云部署提供更高效的神经网络训练方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of
optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve
scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient
neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭银行系统的普及增加了网络欺诈风险，需要既准确又公平可解释的欺诈检测机制。现有AI模型存在计算效率低、可解释性挑战和优化复杂性等问题。

Method: 提出CSNPC（相组编码脏刷神经网络）和RHOSS（强化学习超趋优化器）结合的框架。CSNPC采用生物受启发的相组编码技术，RHOSS使用Q学习动态选择超参数优化策略，并集成XAI技术提高透明度。

Conclusion: 证明了相组编码SNN与强化学习超趋优化结合在实际金融应用中实现公平、透明和高性能欺诈检测的潜力。

Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.

Method: 提出子空间约束训练方法，将特征方向初始化到激活的活跃子空间中

Result: 在100万特征的注意力输出SAE中，死特征从87%减少到低于1%，方法可扩展到其他稀疏字典学习方法

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力的几何结构新见解，并为大语言模型中稀疏字典学习提供了实用改进工具

Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional
hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly
low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\%
of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output
projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and
datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of
the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it
creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic
geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a
subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),
initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our
approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs
with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning
methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention
and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language
models.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果表明该方法具有显著性能优势。

Conclusion: DUFL能有效协调数据陈旧性和数据量，提升联邦学习模型性能。

Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning
with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data
staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to
optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client
selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data
volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in
Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data
update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data
conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate
staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we
introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data
staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative
relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage
Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data
update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal
strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

Conclusion: 基于签名的近似方法对高效生成建模具有有效性

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative
modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often
requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG
(Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for
distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the
backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by
high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG
leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over
sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global
approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised
learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a
fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference,
Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be
simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing
the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM强化学习面临探索困境：高质量样本学习依赖于探索，但探索又受限于LLM自身能力，形成无法探索就无法学习的恶性循环。

Method: 提出RuscaRL框架：1）在生成阶段使用评分标准作为外部指导，引导多样化高质量响应；2）在训练阶段使用评分标准作为可验证奖励，实现有效RL训练。指导随时间逐渐衰减，促进模型内化推理模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升模型性能：Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct在HealthBench-500上从23.6提升至50.3，超越GPT-4.1；Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct达到61.1，超越包括OpenAI-o3在内的领先LLM。

Conclusion: RuscaRL成功解决了LLM强化学习中的探索瓶颈问题，通过评分标准脚手架有效扩展了推理边界，为通用推理任务的RL训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of
reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma
persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet
the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of
LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be
explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded
Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework
designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.
Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit
scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics
are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse
high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,
encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)
verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain
robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL
on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding
reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL
significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,
surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading
LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

Conclusion: PSI提供了一个原则性和实用的工具，用于发现、量化和研究神经网络中的多义单元，有助于提升神经网络的可解释性。

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

Result: 在GSM8k-adv数据集上的实验显示反思水平存在明显分层，激活干预证实了反思的可控性，抑制反思比激发反思更容易实现。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解LLM反思推理的机制开辟了新途径，既展示了增强反思防御的机会，也揭示了对抗性抑制反思在越狱攻击中的风险。

Abstract: Reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and
revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on
complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective
prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner
mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We
propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how
instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic
reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between
these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing
instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be
directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)
suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments
on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across
reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of
reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g.,
reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of
reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic
understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该算法在对抗性在线学习环境中有效处理长期预算约束，适用于广泛的近似凸函数类，并通过匹配的下界证明了结果的紧致性。

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the
adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an
action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost
function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and
consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad
class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex
optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex
Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online
algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while
approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an
efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$
$\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at
most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information
and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach
yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with
Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower
bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize
the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results
apply to a broad family of problems.

Motivation: 长上下文LLM推理的瓶颈在于KV缓存线性增长，需要探索CARTRIDGE压缩机制的内部工作原理以优化其训练和扩展。

Method: 通过实证分析CARTRIDGE键值向量的功能，提出键向量作为检索路由器、值向量负责压缩的理论，并设计采样块初始化(SCI)方法来改进训练收敛速度。

Result: 实验证明CARTRIDGE键向量在不同任务间可共享而性能损失很小，值向量承担主要压缩功能，SCI能带来更快的训练收敛。

Conclusion: 本研究为CARTRIDGE训练优化提供了机制性理解基础，对进一步扩展长上下文LLM推理具有重要意义。

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache.
Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline
compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full
document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we
present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value
cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as
stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of
the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present
empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and
model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors
between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight
improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We
suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously
demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader
empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for
further scaling.

*Kiran Madhusudhanan,Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi,Jonas Sonntag,Maximilian Stubbemann,Lars Schmidt-Thieme*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabResFlow是一种用于表格回归的归一化样条流模型，通过MLP编码器、ResNet主干网络和条件样条流来灵活估计复杂的目标分布，在概率回归任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格回归方法主要关注点估计，容易产生过度自信的预测，而现有概率回归方法通常假设固定形状分布（如高斯分布），无法处理现实世界中复杂的分布形态。

Method: TabResFlow包含三个核心组件：(1)每个数值特征的MLP编码器；(2)全连接ResNet主干网络用于特征提取；(3)基于条件样条的归一化流进行灵活可处理的密度估计。

Result: 在9个公开基准数据集上，TabResFlow在似然分数上持续超越现有概率回归模型，相比最强的TreeFlow提升9.64%，相比最强的深度学习替代方案NodeFlow推理速度平均提升5.6倍。在二手车价格预测的选择性回归任务中，使用新的AURC指标也取得了优越结果。

Conclusion: TabResFlow为表格回归提供了一种灵活且高效的概率建模方法，能够更好地处理复杂的目标分布，在工业自动化等需要可信决策的场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial
applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often
leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in
industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.
Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction
uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape
distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution
parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target
distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for
univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like
RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow
consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical
feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature
extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and
tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark
datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic
regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%
improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model
(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the
strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the
practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction
task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we
introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that
TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准空间分区哈希方法中二叉搜索树(BSTs)的指数增长和稀疏性问题，以及癌症基因组学中突变解释的挑战，需要开发更高效、可扩展的计算工具。

Method: 提出了三种主要方法：1) ComBI(压缩BST和倒排哈希表)用于快速近似最近邻搜索；2) GRAF(引导随机森林)集成分类器结合全局和局部分区；3) CRCS(密码子切换连续表示)深度学习框架将遗传变化嵌入数值向量。

Result: ComBI在10亿样本数据集上达到0.90精度，速度比Multi-Index Hashing快4-296倍；GRAF在115个数据集上表现竞争性或更优精度；CRCS在膀胱癌、肝癌和脑癌中验证了生存预测能力。

Conclusion: 这些方法为大规模数据分析和生物医学应用提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的工具，特别是在癌症基因组学和生存预测方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing,
classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing
relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity
hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted
hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves
0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also
outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.
Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a
tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,
bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.
Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its
unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.
We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,
which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address
challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of
Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes
into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without
matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,
with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.
Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools
for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可以应用于任何现有GNN架构，为关键应用提供了更可靠和可解释的图分类解决方案

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their
predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their
adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习面临拜占庭故障和高通信成本的双重挑战，现有方法在结合通信压缩和拜占庭鲁棒聚合时存在性能下降问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出RoSDHB算法，整合经典Polyak动量和新型协调压缩机制，仅需假设诚实工作节点的平均损失函数Lipschitz光滑，无需额外的全局Hessian方差有界光滑性假设。

Result: 在标准(G,B)梯度差异异质性模型下，RoSDHB性能与Byz-DASHA-PAGE相当，但在基准图像分类任务中实现了强鲁棒性和显著通信节省。

Conclusion: RoSDHB算法通过协调压缩和动量机制，在减少假设条件的同时有效解决了分布式学习中的拜占庭容错和通信效率问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized
data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs.
While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction
is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication
compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty
nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29],
makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental
impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new
algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a
new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably
to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity
heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we
only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest
workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of
bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image
classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with
significant communication savings.

TL;DR: MoE-Beyond是一个基于学习的专家激活预测器，通过训练轻量级transformer模型来预测MoE模型中的专家激活，显著提高GPU缓存命中率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MoE模型在边缘设备部署面临内存限制挑战，传统启发式专家缓存策略在模型参数扩展时难以维持高缓存命中率

Method: 将任务构建为多标签序列预测问题，使用从DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE提取的6600万专家激活轨迹训练轻量级transformer模型

Result: 在WebGLM-QA数据集上达到97.5%准确率和86.6% F1分数，GPU缓存命中率从17%提升至72%（仅10%专家可放入GPU缓存时）

Conclusion: MoE-Beyond通过学习型预测器有效解决了MoE模型在资源受限环境中的内存管理问题，显著优于传统启发式方法

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices
presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE
architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by
activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory
management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity
struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this
work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor
trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By
framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a
lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted
from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor
generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6],
achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that
MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts
fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究了有限和优化问题中的战略梯度查询策略，相比均匀查询可以提升随机梯度方法的性能。提出了理论上的Oracle梯度查询(OGQ)和实用的战略梯度查询(SGQ)算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机梯度下降(SGD)采用均匀查询策略，没有考虑不同用户梯度对优化的贡献差异。本文旨在探索通过战略性地选择查询对象来提升优化性能。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1) OGQ - 理想化算法，每次选择期望改进最大的用户梯度；2) SGQ - 实用算法，每轮只查询一个用户但性能优于SGD。理论分析了在平滑且满足Polyak-Lojasiewicz条件的函数上的性能。

Result: 理论证明：在期望改进异质性假设下，OGQ能提升瞬态性能并降低稳态方差；SGQ在瞬态性能上优于SGD。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 战略梯度查询策略相比均匀查询能显著提升优化算法的性能，特别是在瞬态阶段。SGQ算法在保持实用性的同时实现了性能提升。

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order
queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic
gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first
introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects
one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at
each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to
make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical
algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making
only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI
heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces
steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.
Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种参数最小化的密度聚类方法，显著提高了算法的易用性和应用范围，对于需要聚类分析但缺乏领域专业知识的用户具有重要价值。

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

Conclusion: CIFR基准测试和探测监控器方法为微调API安全防御提供了有效解决方案，开源代码和数据以促进该关键领域的进一步研究

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning APIs enable widespread model customization,
yet pose significant safety risks. Recent work shows that adversaries can
exploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding
harmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human
monitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API
defense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark
(CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model
safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired
level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and
families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for
generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate
different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal
activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over
99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and
compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source
CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research
in this critical area. Code and data are available online

Motivation: 传统的正交梯度下降使用欧几里得投影，忽略了神经网络参数化分布空间的信息几何结构，可能导致学习任务中的收敛次优。

Result: 在Permuted和Rotated MNIST数据集上进行了性能基准测试。

Conclusion: ONG方法通过结合自然梯度和正交投影，在保持先前任务性能的同时，提供了更符合信息几何结构的优化方向。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual
learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying
information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by
neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To
counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and
present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new
task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher
information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction
under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks,
ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior
task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure,
introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and
Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be
found at https://github.com/yajatyadav/orthogonal-natural-gradient.

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法将对抗性ID样本误判为OOD样本，且在对抗攻击下的ID和OOD数据检测研究不足，需要开发能够区分两者的鲁棒方法。

Method: 引入Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)框架，使用Jitter-based扰动在对抗训练中平滑损失景观，提升几何嵌入质量以准确计算OOD分数。

Result: 在CIFAR-100与六个OOD数据集的各种攻击下，SaGD显著改善了FPR和AUC指标，优于现有最先进的防御方法。

Conclusion: SaGD框架通过处理尖锐损失景观问题，有效提升了对抗攻击下的OOD检测性能，揭示了损失景观锐度与对抗性OOD检测之间的关系。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model
deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect
OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,
this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD
predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under
attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method
that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss
landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting
the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce
a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the
rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced
geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,
benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based
perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against
unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the
state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other
OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of
perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the
relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and
highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in

Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险场景中常呈现过信任问题，以不必要的确定性呈现信息，需要探索其内部机制基础

Method: 使用基于人工标注断言性数据集微调的Llama 3.2模型，提取残差激活并计算相似性指标来定位断言表达表征，分析对断言性对比最敏感的层

Result: 高断言性表征可分解为情绪和逻辑两个正交子组件，导向向量显示不同的因果效应：情绪向量广泛影响预测准确性，逻辑向量产生更局部的效应

Conclusion: 研究为LLM断言性的多组件结构提供了机制证据，并为减缓过信任行为突显了新的干预途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting
information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate
the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using
open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness
datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute
similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis
identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that
high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of
emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration
Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these
sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly
influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized
effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component
structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating
overconfident behavior.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased
test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while
effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their
applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This
paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with
budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their
thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special
control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its
remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage
training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize
the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize
for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker
significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a
variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method
provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and
controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for
deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

TL;DR: MedThreatRAG是一个针对医疗RAG系统的多模态投毒攻击框架，通过注入对抗性图像-文本对来破坏跨模态对齐，导致检索和生成性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗AI中广泛使用检索增强生成技术，但这种对外部知识库的依赖创造了新的攻击面，需要系统性地探究医疗RAG系统的安全漏洞。

Method: 构建模拟半开放攻击环境，引入跨模态冲突注入（CMCI）技术，在医学图像和配对报告中嵌入细微的语义矛盾，同时保持足够的合理性以规避传统过滤器。

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR QA任务上，MedThreatRAG使答案F1分数最多下降27.66%，LLaVA-Med-1.5的F1率低至51.36%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了临床RAG系统的根本性安全漏洞，强调了威胁感知设计和鲁棒多模态一致性检查的迫切需求，并提供了安全开发指南。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于决策Transformer和广义策略梯度框架的可靠最短路径规划方案，用于处理随机交通网络中的依赖性和不确定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市交通拖塞问题严重，现有导航模型忽视了交通流的相关性和随机性，需要更准确的路径规划策略来提高准时到达概率。

Method: 结合决策Transformer的长期依赖建模能力和广义策略梯度(GPG)框架，提出了一种新的路径规划解决方案。

Result: 在Sioux Falls网络上的实验结果显示，该方法在准时到达概率方面超过了之前的基线方法，提供了更准确的路径规划解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为随机交通网络中的可靠最短路径问题提供了有效解决方案，通过结合Transformer和强化学习技术，显著提高了路径规划的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival
probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

<details>

Motivation: 双曲神经网络(HNNs)在处理层次结构数据方面表现出色，但曲率选择不当会导致次优参数和性能下降。目前缺乏关于曲率对HNNs影响的理论基础。

Method: 提出锐度感知曲率学习方法：设计曲率范围锐度度量，通过双层优化最小化；引入隐式微分算法近似曲率梯度；提供近似误差和收敛性分析。

Result: 在分类、长尾数据学习、噪声数据学习和少样本学习四个设置上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升HNNs的性能。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，提出的曲率学习方法能够优化双曲神经网络的损失景观，显著改善其泛化能力。

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

Motivation: 现有的参数高效遗忘方法大多以模块无关的方式设计，无法准确识别Transformer中的关键参数，导致遗忘性能不佳。需要一种模块感知的方法来更好地处理Transformer架构的遗忘需求。

Method: 使用可学习的掩码对来识别Transformer中头和过滤器的影响关键参数，通过包含遗忘期望的学习目标，采用带有热启动的贪婪搜索高效算法进行优化。

Conclusion: MAPE-Unlearn提供了一种模块感知的参数高效机器学习遗忘方法，能够有效解决Transformer模型中的特定数据影响移除问题，满足隐私法规要求。

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large
models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications.
Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data
influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting
updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient
unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which
tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior
unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt
MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach
that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters
in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks
is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient
algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments
on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于注意力矩阵有效秩的新容量概念，为过参数化Transformer模型的泛化能力提供理论解释，其泛化边界与大型语言模型的经验缩放定律相匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统复杂度度量（如VC维或PAC-Bayes边界）在过参数化体系中变得空洞，无法解释Transformer等模型在实践中的成功泛化。需要寻找新的理论框架来解释为什么参数远多于训练样本的深度神经网络仍能良好泛化。

Method: 提出基于注意力矩阵有效秩的容量概念，分析注意力机制的功能维度而非原始参数数量，推导出与样本大小相关的泛化边界。

Result: 基于注意力有效秩的泛化边界在样本大小依赖性上与大型语言模型观察到的经验缩放定律相匹配（最多相差对数因子），表明注意力谱特性可能是理解模型泛化的正确视角。

Conclusion: 虽然分析不是过参数化学习的完整理论，但提供了证据表明注意力的谱特性（而非原始参数数量）可能是理解这些模型为何能够泛化的正确方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near
the ground with CFD software requires much time. However, the availability of
data from CFD simulation results and the development of new neural network
methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods
like VGG, a CCN neural network method. In this article, lift-to-drag
coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of
a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for
training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag
ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section,
which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other
methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度学习在心律失常检测上达到了高精度，但可解释性不足阻碍了临床应用。需要研究适合心电图分析的可解释性技术来提高医疗专业人员的信任和接受度。

Method: 使用MIT-BIH心律失常数据集和额外12导联心电图数据集，构建卷积神经网络分类模型。通过Pan-Tompkins算法进行R波基础分割。实施用户需求评估确定医疗专业人员偏好的解释方式，并比较四种SHAP方法：排列重要性、KernelSHAP、梯度基础方法和DeepLIFT。

Result: 模型在MIT-BIH数据集上达到98.3%验证准确率，但在混合数据集上性能下降。医疗专业人员更偏好显著性地图解释方式。排列重要性和KernelSHAP产生杂乱的视觉输出，而梯度基础方法和DeepLIFT能够突出与临床推理一致的波形区域。

Conclusion: 研究强调了心电图分析领域需要领域特定的可解释性适配，显著性地图是更具临床直观性的接受方式。不同样本间的可解释性结果变化也呈现出了数据集变异性的挑战。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia
detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于物理信息的神经网络(PINN)框架，用于预测核反应堆用辐照奥氏体和铁素体/马氏体钢的低周疲劳寿命，相比传统机器学习方法具有更高精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核反应堆材料在高温辐照和循环载荷下出现复杂退化，传统经验模型无法准确预测其疲劳寿命，需要开发更可靠的预测方法。

Method: 开发PINN模型，在损失函数中融入物理疲劳寿命约束，使用495个数据点（包括辐照和未辐照条件）进行训练，并与随机森林、梯度提升等传统方法对比。

Result: PINN模型优于所有对比模型，SHAP分析识别出应变幅值、辐照剂量和测试温度为关键特征，且与疲劳寿命呈负相关，符合物理理解。模型成功捕捉F/M钢在高应变幅值下的疲劳寿命饱和行为。

Conclusion: PINN框架为辐照合金疲劳寿命预测提供了可靠且可解释的方法，有助于明智的合金选择决策。

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to
predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and
ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials
experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing
complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture
accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life
constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and
generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning
models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and
the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis
identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as
dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with
physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at
higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a
reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated
alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器依赖固定稀疏度约束，无法适应不同输入的复杂度变化，需要更智能的特征分配策略

Method: 利用线性探针证明上下文复杂度在线性编码中的线性关系，基于此信号在训练过程中动态调整特征分配，实现复杂度驱动的自适应稀疏度

Result: 在三个语言模型(Pythia-70M、Pythia-160M和Gemma-2-2B)上的实验显示，在重构保真度、解释方差和余弦相似度指标上显著优于固定稀疏度方法

Conclusion: 复杂度驱动的自适应方法不仅性能更优，还消除了大量超参数调优的计算负担，为LLM内部表示的可解释性研究提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs)
remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable
features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail
to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders
(AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based
on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we
demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations,
and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments
across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B)
demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms
fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and
cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of
extensive hyperparameter tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在弯曲流形（如球面）上的频率相关学习行为，探索固定权重和可训练权重情况下频率优先原则的有效性和局限性。

Method: 使用球谐函数展开分析浅层ReLU网络在S²球面上的学习动力学，比较固定神经元方向和可训练方向两种情况，并通过数值实验验证理论分析。

Result: 固定权重时谐波系数以O(ℓ^{5/2}/2^ℓ)衰减，可训练权重时衰减更快为O(ℓ^{7/2}/2^ℓ)，都倾向于低频优先学习，但在特定初始条件或误差分布下FP可能被违反。可训练方向增加了学习复杂性，可能保持低频优势或实现更快的高频涌现。

Conclusion: 频率优先原则在球面等弯曲域上应被视为一种趋势而非绝对规则，方向更新和谐波展开共同塑造了频率依赖的学习行为。

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the
unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\),
considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed
weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency
preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex

<details>

Motivation: 随着LLM被广泛用于自动化代码审查和静态分析，需要识别其潜在的安全漏洞，特别是模型可能因过度泛化熟悉编程模式而忽略小但重要bug的抽象偏见问题。

Method: 开发了全自动黑盒算法来发现和注入熟悉模式攻击(FPA)，通过在目标代码中进行最小编辑来利用LLM的抽象偏见，而不影响实际运行时行为。

Result: FPA攻击对GPT-4o、Claude 3.5、Gemini 2.0等多种模型有效，支持Python、C、Rust、Go等多种编程语言，即使使用防御性系统提示也无法完全阻止。

Conclusion: 熟悉模式攻击揭示了LLM代码分析系统的严重安全漏洞，需要重新评估基于LLM的代码审查工具的可靠性，同时也探讨了FPA的防御性应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated
code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as
vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we
identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an
abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming
patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this
blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal
edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as
a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects
FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,
but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and
universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs
remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via
robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and
discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of
code-oriented LLMs.

Conclusion: ShaLa成功解决了多模态VAE的关键挑战，在共享潜在表示学习和多模态合成方面表现出色，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

*Omar Bekdache,Naresh Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedERL是首个在联邦学习中同时考虑客户端时间能耗约束和抗数据损坏鲁棒性的方法，通过服务器端数据无关鲁棒训练实现零客户端开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临客户端计算资源受限和缺乏对常见数据损坏（噪声、模糊、天气效应）鲁棒性的挑战，现有鲁棒训练方法计算成本高且不适合资源受限的客户端

Method: 提出FedERL框架，核心是服务器端的数据无关鲁棒训练（DART）方法，在不访问训练数据的情况下增强模型鲁棒性，确保客户端零鲁棒性开销

Result: 大量实验表明FedERL能够以传统鲁棒训练方法的一小部分时间和能耗成本处理常见数据损坏，在有限时间和能耗预算下性能超越传统方法

Conclusion: FedERL为现实世界联邦学习应用提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，在保持数据隐私的同时实现了高效的鲁棒性训练

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on
edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges
due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of
robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects.
Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable
for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and
robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness
under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL
employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to
enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL
ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate
FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and
energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited
time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust
training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
FL applications.

Motivation: 解决图神经网络固定标签空间的限制和大型语言模型缺乏结构归纳偏置的问题，探索通过显式推理链进行零样本图学习的新途径。

Method: 将图任务重新表述为文本推理问题，构建带详细推理痕迹的数据集，开发基于强化学习的Graph-R1框架，使用任务特定的重新思考模板指导线性化图上的推理。

Result: Graph-R1在零样本设置下优于最先进的基线方法，能够生成可解释且有效的预测结果。

Conclusion: 显式推理在图学习中具有巨大潜力，为未来研究提供了新的资源和方向。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains
challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces,
while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent
advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via
explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a
GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by
LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these
tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages
task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs.
Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work
highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides
new resources for future research.

### [314] [Effective Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17388)
*Xiaoyang Lin,Runhao Jiang,Renchi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DEMM和DEMM+两种多关系图聚类方法，通过新颖的两阶段优化目标解决现有方法在异构图结构融合和可扩展性方面的局限性，DEMM+通过优化技术实现更高的效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多关系图聚类方法要么因异构图结构和属性融合效果差而导致结果质量严重受损，要么因采用复杂昂贵的深度学习模型而难以处理大规模图数据。

Method: 基于新颖的两阶段优化目标：第一阶段通过优化多关系Dirichlet能量获得高质量节点特征向量，第二阶段在节点亲和图上最小化聚类结果的Dirichlet能量。DEMM+通过高效近似求解器和理论支撑的问题转换实现线性时间聚类。

Result: 在11个真实多关系图上与20个基线方法比较，DEMM+在聚类质量方面始终优于其他方法，且通常显著更快。

Conclusion: DEMM+方法在多关系图聚类任务中实现了优异的聚类质量和高效的可扩展性，能够有效处理大规模图数据。

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling
diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade
extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning
the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in
analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the
majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised
result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and
attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and
billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning
models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to
address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel
two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive
high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet
energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of
clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves
significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM
through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions
include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node
feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with
carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without
explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend
DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive
experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit
that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured
against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

TL;DR: 研究发现检索性能随着LLM模型规模、训练时长和FLOPs的增长而可预测地提升，上下文学习成绩与检索成绩强相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索检索性能如何随着预训练计算量(FLOPs)的扩展而变化，以了解大语言模型在检索任务上的规律性

Method: 在125M到7B参数范围内测试不同规模LLM，训练数据从1B到2T比特，在零样本BEIR任务上评测检索性能

Result: 检索性能随模型规模、训练时长和FLOPs的增长而可预测地提升，上下文学习与检索成绩呈现强相关性

Conclusion: 这为LLM基于检索器的发展提供了重要启示，标志着检索性能可通过增大模型规模和计算资源来系统性提升

Abstract: How does retrieval performance scale with pretraining FLOPs? We benchmark
retrieval performance across LLM model sizes from 125 million parameters to 7
billion parameters pretrained on datasets ranging from 1 billion tokens to more
than 2 trillion tokens. We find that retrieval performance on zero-shot BEIR
tasks predictably scales with LLM size, training duration, and estimated FLOPs.
We also show that In-Context Learning scores are strongly correlated with
retrieval scores across retrieval tasks. Finally, we highlight the implications
this has for the development of LLM-based retrievers.

### [316] [Mutual Information Surprise: Rethinking Unexpectedness in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17403)
*Yinsong Wang,Xiao Liu,Quan Zeng,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了互信息惊喜(MIS)框架，将惊喜重新定义为认知增长信号而非异常检测，通过统计测试检测互信息变化，并开发了MISRP策略来动态调整系统行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主系统的认知控制有限，缺乏检测和适应意外情况的机制。传统惊喜度量只能检测瞬时偏差，无法捕捉系统是否真正在学习适应。

Method: 引入互信息惊喜(MIS)框架，量化新观测对互信息的影响；开发统计测试序列检测互信息的有意义变化；提出互信息惊喜反应策略(MISRP)通过采样调整和进程分叉动态控制系统行为。

Result: 在合成领域和动态污染地图估计任务中的实证评估显示，MISRP治理策略在稳定性、响应性和预测准确性方面显著优于基于传统惊喜的方法。

Conclusion: 通过将惊喜从反应性转变为反思性，MIS为更自我意识和自适应的自主系统提供了一条路径。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated
remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains
limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core
limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the
unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or
Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture
whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce
Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not
as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the
impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems
to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test
sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and
propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically
governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.
Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map
estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform
classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and
predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS
offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

*Avishag Shapira,Simon Shigol,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FRAME是一个首个全面自动化评估对抗性机器学习风险的框架，通过系统评估部署环境、AML技术特性和实证研究来量化风险，适用于不同ML系统且无需AML专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险评估框架无法应对对抗性机器学习(AML)的独特挑战，现有AML评估方法主要关注技术攻击鲁棒性而忽略现实世界因素，且缺乏跨领域应用的综合性解决方案。

Method: FRAME框架包含新颖的风险评估方法，系统评估三个关键维度：目标系统部署环境、多样化AML技术特性、先前研究的实证见解，并整合可行性评分机制和基于LLM的系统特定评估定制。

Result: 在六个不同的真实世界应用中验证，展示了卓越的准确性和与AML专家分析的高度一致性，能够为系统所有者提供可直接使用的可操作结果。

Conclusion: FRAME使组织能够优先处理AML风险，支持在真实环境中安全部署AI系统，是首个全面且自动化的跨系统AML风险评估框架。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention
to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML)
techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an
urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While
traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity
risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.
Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack
robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment
environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at
comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific
solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these
limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework
for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel
risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating
three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics
of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME
incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for
system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive
structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From
an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results
designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their
systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse
real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and
strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to
prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world
environments.

### [318] [Convergence and Generalization of Anti-Regularization for Parametric Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17412)
*Dongseok Kim,Wonjun Jeong,Gisung Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anti-regularization (AR) 是一种在小样本情况下通过添加符号反转的奖励项来增加模型表达能力的方法，随着样本量增长使用幂律衰减来减弱干预，包含稳定性保护机制，在回归和分类任务中都能减少欠拟合同时保持泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本学习中的欠拟合问题，传统正则化方法可能过度约束模型表达能力，需要在数据受限环境下实现更稳健的学习。

Method: 在损失函数中添加符号反转的奖励项来增加模型表达能力，使用幂律衰减机制随着样本量增长减弱干预，设计轻量级稳定性保护（投影算子和梯度裁剪），在神经正切核(NTK)机制下进行分析。

Result: AR方法减少了欠拟合问题，同时保持了泛化性能并改善了校准效果，在回归和分类任务中都表现良好。消融研究证实衰减调度和稳定性保护对防止过拟合和数值不稳定性至关重要。

Conclusion: Anti-regularization是一种简单易实现的方法，能够无缝集成到标准经验风险最小化流程中，在数据和资源受限的环境中实现稳健学习，只在有益时进行干预并在不必要时逐渐消退。

Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term
to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample
regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the
sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions,
and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection
operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated
assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by
balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting
while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression
and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the
stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical
instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that
keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement
and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization
pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained
settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

TL;DR: MMF是一种一步生成建模方法，通过学习时间平均速度场实现高效高质量数据生成，统一了现有一致性方法和流匹配方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散或流式模型需要多步评估，效率较低。本文旨在开发单步生成高质量样本的方法，提高生成效率。

Method: 提出Modular MeanFlow (MMF)方法，基于瞬时速度与平均速度的微分恒等式推导损失函数族，包含梯度调制机制和课程式预热调度。

Result: 在图像合成和轨迹建模任务中，MMF实现了竞争性的样本质量、稳健收敛和强泛化能力，特别是在低数据或分布外设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: MMF提供了一个灵活且理论完备的框架，能够高效生成高质量样本，避免了昂贵的高阶导数计算，在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a
single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional
diffusion or flow-based models. In this work, we introduce Modular MeanFlow
(MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning
time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions
based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities,
and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training
without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style
warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully
differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing
consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive
higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and
trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample
quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under
low-data or out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: TreePO为基于RL的后训练提供了一条实用路径，以更少的样本和计算实现推理效率的免费提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鲁棒约束强化学习旨在在模型不确定性最坏情况下优化智能体性能同时满足安全约束，但传统对偶方法因强对偶性不成立而可能失效。

Method: 提出了Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO)算法，直接在原始问题上操作，不依赖于对偶公式，通过控制不确定性集直径来保证收敛。

Result: 理论分析表明RRPO在温和正则性假设下具有收敛保证，迭代复杂度匹配已知下界；网格世界实验验证了算法在模型不确定性下的鲁棒安全性。

Conclusion: RRPO算法有效解决了鲁棒约束RL中的强对偶性问题，能够找到近似最优的可行策略，在保证安全约束的同时实现鲁棒性能。

Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an
agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying
safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong
duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that
traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called
Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the
primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence
to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching
the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a
specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the
effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe
performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate
the worst-case safety constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分支启发式方法在异构问题实例间泛化能力差，现有学习方法如模仿学习依赖专家演示质量，强化学习面临稀疏奖励和动态状态表示的挑战。

Method: 提出ReviBranch框架，通过复活分支决策与其在图状态中的历史对应关系来构建复活轨迹，引入重要性加权的奖励重分配机制将稀疏终端奖励转化为密集的逐步反馈。

Result: 在不同MILP基准测试中，ReviBranch优于最先进的RL方法，在大规模实例上减少4.0%的B&B节点和2.2%的LP迭代次数。

Conclusion: ReviBranch在异构MILP问题类别中展现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决分支变量选择问题提供了有效的深度强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer
Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential
to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching
often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing
learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence
on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with
limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To
address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that
constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences
between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along
search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from
complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching
process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward
redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense
stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive
experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch
outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP
iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the
robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem
classes.

Abstract: Classification in the context of multi-label data streams represents a

changes in the data distribution (concept drift), the emergence of new labels
(concept evolution), and the latency in the arrival of ground truth labels.
This systematic literature review presents an in-depth analysis of multi-label
data stream classification proposals. We characterize the latest methods in the
literature, providing a comprehensive overview, building a thorough hierarchy,
and discussing how the proposals approach each problem. Furthermore, we discuss
the adopted evaluation strategies and analyze the methods' asymptotic
complexity and resource consumption. Finally, we identify the main gaps and
offer recommendations for future research directions in the field.

TL;DR: 该论文提出叠加(superposition)可能是对抗样本的主要成因，通过理论分析、玩具模型实验和ResNet18实验提供了四条证据链支持这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗样本作为深度学习中最令人困惑的现象之一，近十年来缺乏根本机制共识。叠加这一机制解释性概念可能是主要成因，但此前研究不足。

Method: 采用四条证据链方法：(1)理论分析叠加解释对抗现象的能力；(2)在玩具模型中干预叠加控制鲁棒性；(3)在玩具模型中通过对抗训练干预鲁棒性控制叠加；(4)在ResNet18中通过对抗训练干预鲁棒性控制叠加。

Result: 研究发现叠加确实能够解释多种对抗现象，在玩具模型和真实网络中都证实了叠加与鲁棒性之间的双向因果关系。

Conclusion: 叠加很可能是对抗样本的主要成因，这一发现为理解对抗性现象提供了新的机制性解释，并扩展了Elhage等人先前的工作。

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool
neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena
despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations
have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One
underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic
interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary
cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly
extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can
theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models,
intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models,
intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition,
and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training)
controls superposition.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have enabled the scaling of Large Language

several inference-time challenges, including load imbalance across experts and
the additional routing computational overhead. To address these challenges and

acceleration techniques is essential. We present MoE-Inference-Bench, a
comprehensive study to evaluate MoE performance across diverse scenarios. We
analyze the impact of batch size, sequence length, and critical MoE

evaluate several optimization techniques on Nvidia H100 GPUs, including
pruning, Fused MoE operations, speculative decoding, quantization, and various

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的模型无关方法，通过人工干预和决策树模型来识别和缩正预测性过程监控中的偏见决策，并在敏感属性同时被公平和不公平使用的情况下实现公平性与准确性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性过程监控中的机器学习模型容易受到数据中不公平、偏见或不道德模式的影响，导致基于敏感属性的偏见预测。但敏感属性在同一过程中可能同时被公平和不公平地使用，传统的完全移除敏感属性的方法无法处理这种复杂情况。

Method: 提出一种模型无关的方法，通过人工干预方式，使用从原始预测模型精炼的决策树模型来区分公平和不公平的决策。该方法允许通过简单的修改来识别和缩正偏见决策。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法在存在偏见数据的情况下，能够实现公平性与准确性之间的有前景的平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为预测性过程监控领域提供了一种有效的方法来处理敏感属性同时被公平和不公平使用的复杂情况，通过人工干预和决策树模型实现了偏见识别和缩正，为建立更公平的人工智能系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and
intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete
process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining
time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have
shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of
these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical
patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on
so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process
participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions
that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process
instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in
the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment
decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient
should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic
approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business
process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both
fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to
differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a
decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results
show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness
and accuracy in the presence of biased data. All source code and data are

### [327] [Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497)
*Yang Qiao,Yuntong Hu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RCML是一个关系条件多模态学习框架，通过自然语言关系描述指导特征提取和对齐，解决了传统对比模型在语义关系利用、上下文对齐和模态一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对比学习模型（如CLIP）存在三个主要问题：1）主要关注图像-文本对，未能充分利用不同对之间的语义关系；2）直接匹配全局嵌入而缺乏上下文化，忽略了特定子空间或关系维度的语义对齐需求；3）强调跨模态对比，但对模态内一致性的支持有限。

Method: 提出RCML框架：1）构建由语义关系连接的多样化训练对；2）引入关系引导的交叉注意力机制，在每个关系上下文下调节多模态表示；3）结合跨模态和模态内对比损失，鼓励跨模态和语义相关样本的一致性。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验表明，RCML在检索和分类任务上均持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 利用语义关系指导多模态表示学习是有效的，RCML框架通过关系条件学习显著提升了多模态表示的质量和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive
models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text
pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they
directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different
datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both
retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of
leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

TL;DR: 首次将可微分逻辑网络(DLNs)应用于单变量时间序列分类(TSC)，使用Catch22和TSFresh特征提取方法，通过联合超参数搜索优化配置，在51个基准数据集上验证了DLNs在准确率、推理效率和可解释性方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DLNs从表格数据领域扩展到时间序列分类领域，探索其在保持准确性、可解释性和计算效率的同时，能否在时间序列数据上表现良好。

Method: 采用基于Catch22和TSFresh的特征提取方法将时间序列转换为向量形式，通过联合超参数搜索空间优化DLN训练配置，而不是孤立地调整单个参数。

Result: 在51个公开的单变量TSC基准数据集上，DLNs展现出竞争性的准确率、低推理成本和透明的可解释决策逻辑，与之前在表格分类和回归任务中的发现一致。

Conclusion: DLNs成功应用于时间序列分类领域，保持了其在准确性、效率和可解释性方面的核心优势，为时间序列分析提供了新的可解释机器学习方法。

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular
domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing
on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt
feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting
sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification.
Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various
settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into
the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly
optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations
to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51
publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that
classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they
deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide
transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN
findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

TL;DR: 通过简化的注意力门控机制替代传统路由器，提出了一种无需辅助负载均衡损失的MoE时间序列预测模型，在保持高准确性的同时大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE模型需要复杂训练过程、辅助负载均衡损失和精心调整路由参数的问题，以满足实际应用中对简化训练和高效计算的需求。

Method: 结合稀疏MoE计算与新颖注意力门控机制，替代传统的单层softmax路由器，自然促进专家利用均衡。

Result: 在多样化数据集上达到更优的预测准确性，只需少数参数即可超越PatchTST等独占模型，计算效率高于LSTM。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际时间序列预测应用提供了既准确又高效的解决方案，显示了在准确性和计算效率方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world
systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring,
where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and
long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE
models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting
loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful
routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we
propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for
univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and
short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines
sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that
replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced
expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring
the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE
implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a
fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,
such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that
our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally
efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling
cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach
for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Handling missing data in time series classification remains a significant
challenge in various domains. Traditional methods often rely on imputation,
which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics.
In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential
Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation
framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our
approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous
latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to
focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30
benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its
superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only
improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling
of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often
irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and
anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic
Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling
with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular
observations. Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a
numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse
sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate
strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical
events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a
principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为图同配性是MPNN性能的关键，但研究发现性能更依赖于邻域类别分布的一致性。现有方法虽然能增加邻域分布的信息量，但未能有效提升MPNN性能。

Method: 使用Gumbel-Softmax重连方法减少邻域分布的偏差，该方法能处理长距离依赖、缓解过度压缩问题。

Result: 新方法显著提高了邻域信息量，改善了长距离依赖处理能力，减轻了过度压缩现象，并提升了MPNN的分类性能。

Conclusion: 基于Gumbel-Softmax的重连方法是一种有效的图结构优化技术，能显著提升消息传递神经网络的节点分类性能。

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that
performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class
distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number
of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By
breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we
increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not
observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based
rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our
results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles
long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the
classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解transformer残差流中特征的流动机制对于改进越狱防护、早期检测模型错误及其修正具有重要意义，但目前这一动态过程研究不足。

Method: 提出激活传输算子(ATO)，使用下游SAE解码器投影在特征空间中评估上游到下游残差k层后的线性映射，开发传输效率概念并提供上界估计。

Result: 实证证明ATO能够确定特征是从前层线性传输还是非线性合成，报告了传输效率和参与线性传输的残差流子空间大小。

Conclusion: 这种计算轻量(无需微调，<50 GPU小时)的方法为安全性、调试提供了实用工具，并更清晰地展示了LLM中计算表现线性的位置。

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers
via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary
learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation
patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which
features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding
this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection
of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation
Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals
$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder
projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine
whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or
synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of
transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to
estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear
transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport
efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear
transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers
practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where
computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型如何仅通过提示词就能模拟算法执行，揭示上下文学习与算法仿真之间的直接联系

Method: 构造特殊提示词将算法参数编码到token表示中，利用点积间隙迫使softmax注意力执行预定计算，无需前馈层或参数更新

Result: 证明两层softmax注意力模块甚至单头注意力层都能通过提示词精确模拟固定权重注意力头可实现的任何算法

Conclusion: 建立了现代Transformer模型的算法普适性，大型Transformer可作为提示词可编程的算法库，仅通过提示词就能切换不同算法

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic
features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that
S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability
analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our
architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction.
These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable
solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Result: 优化配置的LoRA和DoRA结合AMP显著提升了训练效率而不影响性能；证实即使在小模型中梯度更新也具有低秩特性，rank 1分解导致性能损失微不足道；最终训练出了优化的多任务minBERT模型。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial
intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive,
preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources
from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly
efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM
fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models
such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA
papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied
to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact
minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA
and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance
training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the
parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results
validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are
inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1
decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our
highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,
custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal
ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,
paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

Conclusion: 本文通过结合真实世界多样化数据和多模态图表相似性奖励的强化学习，有效解决了图表到代码生成任务中的关键挑战，为该领域提供了一个高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into
executable code. This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity
and insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and
original charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to
prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To
address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,
human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.
Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct
ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge
is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to
ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To
address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning
algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of
attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as
layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual
similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual
features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based
rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal
nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability
to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we
develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among
7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation
benchmarks. All resources are available at

Conclusion: 通过PI控制机制综合历史信息能够有效提升高维稀疏矩阵分析的性能。

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are
widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive
nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA)
method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI
matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations:
their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient
information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential
knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations
between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal
generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by
developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances
and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control
mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI
matrices

Conclusion: QGAT展示了量子增强学习在化学、生物和网络分析等领域的可扩展潜力，其模块化设计便于集成到现有架构中，为经典注意力模型提供量子增强方案。

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural
network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention
mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with
amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.
Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each
head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate
multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,
experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature
and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.
The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing
architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting
the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where
data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and
labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in
point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to
the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators
with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for
enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.
These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing
specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter
traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional
generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,
providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results
indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not
only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development
of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is
anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving
the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains
challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of
multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant
biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for
effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a
method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation
with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's
disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential
patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction
of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on
diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in
ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects
neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings
highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing
longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's
disease.

Motivation: 解决异质域元素间共现概率的可视化问题，特别是需要展示非对称关系的情况，便于信息探索和分析

Method: 将异质域元素映射到二维潜在空间，通过最大化互信息来保持原始依赖结构，使用总相关性扩展到多域情况，并基于条件概率进行颜色编码实现交互式可视化

Result: 在形容词-名词数据集、NeurIPS数据集和主谓宾数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了域内和域间分析能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效可视化异质域间的非对称共现关系，为信息探索提供了实用的可视化工具

Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at
visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence
probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous
domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into
corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of
asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the
elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving
the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be
naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a
generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For
inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns
colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users
to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility
of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS
dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and
inter-domain analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用多模态大语言模型（GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini）通过高级提示策略生成认知评估的合成规范数据，替代传统耗时费力的数据收集方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知评估的规范数据收集成本高、耗时长且更新不及时，限制了新图像认知测试的开发。需要寻找更高效的方法来生成规范数据。

Method: 采用两种提示策略（基础提示和高级上下文提示），使用GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini模型生成"Cookie Theft"图片描述任务的合成文本响应，并通过嵌入分析、BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和LLM-as-a-judge等方法评估性能。

Result: 高级提示策略产生的合成响应能更好地区分诊断组和捕捉人口统计多样性。BERTScore是最可靠的上下文相似性评估指标，而BLEU对创意输出评估效果较差。LLM-as-a-judge方法显示出有希望的初步验证结果。

Conclusion: 生成式多模态LLM结合精细提示方法可以可行地生成稳健的合成规范数据，为开发新型图像认知评估奠定基础，克服传统限制。

Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for
evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based
on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available
normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional
limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TiKMiX是一种动态调整语言模型预训练数据混合比例的方法，通过Group Influence指标评估数据域影响，相比静态混合策略显著提升性能并减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据混合策略在语言模型预训练中效果不佳，因为模型对不同数据域的学习偏好会随训练过程动态变化，而高效观测这些变化偏好是一个重要挑战。

Method: 提出TiKMiX方法，引入Group Influence指标评估数据域影响，将数据混合问题转化为寻找最优影响力最大化分布的问题。提供两种解决方案：TiKMiX-D直接优化和TiKMiX-M使用回归模型预测更优混合比例。

Result: TiKMiX-D仅用20%计算资源就超越了REGMIX等最先进方法。TiKMiX-M在9个下游基准测试中平均性能提升2%。实验表明模型的数据偏好随训练进度和规模动态演变。

Conclusion: 基于Group Influence动态调整数据混合比例能显著提升性能，有效缓解静态比例导致的数据消化不足问题。

Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a
cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is
suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift
dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving
preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant
challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically
adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX
introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of
data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data
mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.
We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and
TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We
trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion
tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like
REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to
an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our
experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training
progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data
mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,
significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data
seen with static ratios.

Result: 揭示了Mamba状态空间模型在GPU上的运行特性，识别了潜在的瓶颈和优化机会。

Conclusion: 研究为继续扩展此类模型性能提供了新的优化方向，对GPU微架构设计具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.

Result: 提高了内循环收敛质量，显著增加计算效率，并改善了模型对未见攻击的鲁棒泛化能力

Conclusion: 适配器方法在不同骨干架构和大规模对抗训练中均表现出有效性，为构建可信基础模型提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

Conclusion: 反学习-消除法提供了一个原则性框架来映射AI科学发现的真实范围和限制，有望成为下一代测试标准，像ImageNet推动视觉进步一样推动AI科学发现的发展

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to
promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question:
do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely
remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable
test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a
target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop
entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from
only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine
generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing
motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing
repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such
tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet
catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from
those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a
minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics,
chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation
provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI
scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and
methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可分析处理且具有实际意义的理论框架，为未来扩散模型记忆化与泛化行为的理论和实证研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they
able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical
understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may
significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to
issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to
disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and
generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and
mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models
trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this
setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an
underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training
loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe
this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the
weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that
of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model
(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments
that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion
models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our
theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization
becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and
practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical
investigations. Code for our experiments is available at
https://github.com/DruvPai/diffusion_mem_gen.

TL;DR: 本文分析了空中计算联邦学习在大规模客户端场景下的性能，发现增加客户端数量能增强隐私保护、减轻信道衰落影响并改善收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时面临通信资源限制的挑战，特别是在支持大量客户端的系统中。空中计算通过模拟信号传输可以缓解通信瓶颈，但会带来信道失真问题。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析大规模客户端场景下空中联邦学习的性能，并通过广泛的实验评估验证理论见解。

Result: 分析揭示了扩大参与客户端数量的三个关键优势：隐私增强（本地梯度与聚合梯度间的互信息减少）、信道衰落缓解（信道硬化效应消除小尺度衰落影响）、收敛性能改善（热噪声和梯度估计误差减少）。

Conclusion: 空中计算模型训练是联邦学习在大规模客户端网络中可行的解决方案，理论分析得到了实验验证的支持。

Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often
constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems
supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating
over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising
solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly
increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by
transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital
ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced
distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global
parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in
large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of
scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The
mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's
aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)
Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the
impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved
Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the
convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a
viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of
clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive
experimental evaluations.

it applies Gaussian Copula to eliminate sparsity. Then, we utilise five ML
models to make predictions individually. Finally, it employs adaptive ensemble
to get final weighted-sum result. Experiments have demonstrated that our model
are robust.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes molecule generation in

atom-level features to preserve molecular integrity and invariant features to
ensure robustness against affine transformations. Comprehensive experiments

embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while
achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream
docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and
watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root

watermarking technique effectively safeguards molecular intellectual property
without compromising scientific utility, enabling secure and responsible AI

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种有效的解码时安全增强方法，既能防御越狱攻击，又能保持模型实用性并提升推理效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities
continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with
additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning
large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty
ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding
(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired
safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a
small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates
speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the
small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to
dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to
handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original
and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips
the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference
time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

TL;DR: 研究发现随机截断文本嵌入向量高达50%的维度只会导致性能轻微下降（<10%），这与传统认知相反，表明许多均匀分布的维度实际上对性能有害。


<details>

Motivation: 探索截断文本嵌入对下游任务性能的影响，以及这种现象背后的原因，挑战先前关于表示空间利用效率的假设。

Method: 在6个最先进的文本编码器和26个下游任务上进行实验，随机移除不同比例的嵌入维度，分析性能变化和维度分布特征。

Result: 移除50%的嵌入维度仅导致性能下降不到10%，发现大量均匀分布的维度被移除时反而能提升性能，这种现象在生成任务中也存在。

Conclusion: 文本嵌入中存在大量冗余维度，随机截断可以显著减少嵌入大小而保持性能，这对高效表示学习和模型压缩具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings
has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6
state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing
up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,
less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of
using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text
encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested
in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation
space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions
actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,
on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a
marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the
embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on
generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to
classification or retrieval tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of
Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to
address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO
decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer
defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories
into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for
efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The
framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions
within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific
components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in
procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements
in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard
RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's
decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly
valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will
explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to
continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但对超高清视频生成存在计算和内存成本过高的问题，现有标准分辨率平台难以支持2K/4K视频生成。

Method: 采用基于分块的训练免费算法，结合自适应区域感知缓存策略和缓存引导的并行处理技术，利用去噪步骤和空间区域的冗余性加速生成过程。

Result: 评估显示SuperGen在保持高质量输出的同时，实现了最大性能增益，显著降低了内存占用和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: SuperGen为超高清视频生成提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，无需额外训练即可支持多种分辨率，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality
content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.
However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing
standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the
excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and
memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based
framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel
training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide
range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly
reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen
incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that
accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps
and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,
communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized
latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance
gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

*Jelke Wibbeke,Nico Schönfisch,Sebastian Rohjans,Andreas Rauh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了回归校准指标的不一致性问题，发现不同指标对同一校准结果的评估经常产生冲突甚至矛盾结论，识别出ENCE和CWC为最可靠的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，数据驱动模型不仅需要准确，还必须提供可靠的uncertainty估计（校准性）。然而现有的校准指标定义、假设和尺度差异很大，难以解释和比较研究结果，且大多数重新校准方法仅使用少量指标进行评估。

Method: 从文献中系统提取和分类回归校准指标，独立于特定建模方法或重新校准方法对这些指标进行基准测试，使用真实世界数据、合成数据和人工失准数据进行受控实验。

Result: 校准指标经常产生冲突结果：许多指标对同一重新校准结果的评估不一致，有些甚至得出矛盾结论。ENCE和CWC在测试中表现最为可靠。

Conclusion: 指标选择在校准研究中具有关键作用，指标不一致性可能导致选择性地使用指标来制造误导性的成功印象，需要谨慎选择可靠的校准评估指标。

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate
but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly
referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In
regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have
emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,
assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results
across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using
only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements
generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we
systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the
literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling
methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with
real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that
calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis
reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation
of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory
conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially
allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.
We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our
findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration
research.

Motivation: 移动设备深度学习加速器硬件异构性增强，现有调度方法局限于单模型场景、忽视配置性能差异、执行时间估计不准确

Method: 使用遗传算法将网络划分为多个子图，包含三种染色体类型进行分区/映射/优先级探索，采用设备在环分析和评估实现精确执行时间估计

Conclusion: 提出的遗传算法调度方法能有效解决移动设备多深度学习网络在异构处理器上的调度问题，显著提升系统性能

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern
mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the
growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity.
However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these
processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model
scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance
variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with
accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning
networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple
subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for
partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop
profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this
methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive
evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art
networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher
request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only
and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of
real-time requirements.

Motivation: 基础模型的监督微调(SFT)往往导致泛化能力下降，已有能力在微调新任务或领域后会退化

Method: 受强化学习中TRPO和PPO的启发，将SFT视为具有恒定正优势的策略梯度方法特例，提出PSFT目标函数，通过信任区域约束策略漂移

Result: 在数学和人类价值观领域的实验表明，PSFT在域内性能与SFT相当，在域外泛化上优于SFT，长时间训练保持稳定且不会导致熵崩溃

Conclusion: PSFT为后续优化阶段提供了更强的基础，在保持竞争性调优的同时有效约束了策略漂移，实现了更好的泛化性能

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor
generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks
or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal
policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal
SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of
trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while
maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy
gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that
stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for
further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across
mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain,
outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged
training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation
for the subsequent optimization.

extend our model to also explore the conformational landscape of the protein by
jointly sampling side chain angles and molecules.

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对软最大化基于让入机制的理解，并鼓励在未来让入架构中开发更稳健的正则化和选择策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Result: 在合成数据集上达到近优分类准确率，在实际数据集上显著改善性能，免除了MPNN在中等同质性制度下的性能困境

Conclusion: 提供了既可用于评估MPNN性能的诊断工具，也提供了通过理论驱动的图修改方法来提升性能

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node
classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.

Motivation: 随着单中心计算面临功耗限制，去中心化训练变得至关重要。强化学习后训练能增强大语言模型，但在异构分布式环境中由于紧密耦合的采样-学习交替而面临挑战。

Method: 提出HeteroRL异步RL架构，将rollout采样与参数学习解耦；提出Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO)方法，通过改进的采样机制降低重要性权重方差。

Conclusion: 该方法在异构网络中展示了去中心化RL的强大潜力，能够有效应对网络延迟带来的挑战。

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized
training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training
enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous
distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning
alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that
decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment
across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that
latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high
variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization
(GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling
mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction.
Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with
less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating
strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Conclusion: Ada-TransGNN模型通过整合全局空间语义和时间行为，有效提高了空气质量预测的准确性和实时性，为环境领域的空气质量监测提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the
environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark
dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and
long-term predictions.

Conclusion: SFFP框架通过分数傅里叶域变换和自适应滤波，有效提升了频谱预测的准确性和性能。

Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and
resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum
data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to
separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the
Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first
employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform
spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the
separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter
module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive
features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a
complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend
components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP
outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning
challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods
like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies;
notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which
fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix
on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that
achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric
approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational
capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across
benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints
are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

Conclusion: FedMate通过双边优化有效协调了泛化与适应性能，解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性挑战。

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that
impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of
generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing
approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation
center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local
knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus
distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server
side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights
calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and
future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this
prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce
complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination
training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model
performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of
varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic
segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's
real-world scalability.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty
quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.
Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and
reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to
uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights
cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss
functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very
general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even
generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that
connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration
with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We
achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly
proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the
kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based
generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language
generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large
language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which
motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a
novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel
risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration
errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another
kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable
evaluation of generative image models.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various
applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to
identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training
techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,
particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal
distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare
two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss
function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex
state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this
approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and
evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative
impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the
model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals
which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing
insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard
avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained
computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized
Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a
computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater
detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous
planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in
enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP
approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can
significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the
context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression
based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data
assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data
using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose
second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE
accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method
and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved
robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 稳健质心比较方法能够有效地检测流式时间序列中的非参数变点，并减少对基础估计方法的敏感性

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a
long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics
and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing
on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt
changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming
fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when
computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to
leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this
issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical
Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function
(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic
whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We
propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust
centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance
of our proposed method.

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven
by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and
efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures
have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop
aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce
significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In
response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture
that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach
incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and
Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational
efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,
adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations
using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train
over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The
introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with
up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves
parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller.
The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on
average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while
having a similar training speed. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现实世界系统（如通信网络、金融交易网络）是异步演化且可能分裂为不连通组件的连续时间动态图，现有GNN理论仅限于离散动态图序列。

Method: 引入连续时间动态1-WL测试，证明其与连续时间动态展开树的等价性，基于离散动态GNN架构设计连续时间动态GNN（CGNN），使用分段连续可微时间函数处理异步不连通图。

Conclusion: 成功将GNN理论扩展到连续时间动态图领域，为处理现实世界异步演化图系统提供了理论基础和架构指导。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with
the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence,
GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability
up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots.
Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction
networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into
disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with
arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic
1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,
and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on
discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and
universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield
practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN
architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to
process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

TL;DR: FedGreed是一种针对联邦学习的鲁棒聚合策略，通过基于服务器可信数据集评估客户端模型损失来排序和选择最佳客户端更新，无需假设恶意客户端比例，在非IID数据和拜占庭攻击下表现优异。

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端可能表现出拜占庭攻击行为的问题，同时处理现实部署中普遍存在的异构（非IID）数据分布，提供无需假设恶意客户端比例的鲁棒聚合方案。

Method: 提出FedGreed聚合策略：基于服务器可信数据集评估各客户端本地模型更新的损失指标，按损失大小排序后贪婪选择损失最小的客户端子集进行聚合。

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedGreed在标签翻转和高斯噪声注入等攻击场景下显著优于Mean、Trimmed Mean、Median、Krum和Multi-Krum等基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGreed具有收敛保证和有界最优性差距，在强对抗行为和异构数据分布下都能可靠运行，是联邦学习中有效的鲁棒聚合解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In
this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,
exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped
with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy
for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction
of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based
on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and
greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal
evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to
operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are
prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees
and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental
evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines,
such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of
adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise
injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated
learning framework.

Method: 开发了混合量子-经典自动编码器(HQC-AE)，仅使用真实GNSS信号进行训练，利用跟踪阶段提取的特征进行主动检测

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典自动编码器方法能够有效地主动检测各种静态GNSS接收器平台上的零日时间推送恶意攻击

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable
to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead
receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected
navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most
existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques
and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS
signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted
during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT
solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS
receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,
where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time
computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen
time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and
sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently
outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based
models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,
unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy
of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs
but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an
accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day
GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver
platforms.

Conclusion: EM推断与流匹配相结合为混合噪声贝叶斯反问题提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于高维推断场景。

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.

Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant
barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is
paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing
equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their
topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper
provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic
regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including
sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation
of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their
inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical
systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can
successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly
surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this
performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable
activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics.
This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs
between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability
of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex
systems.

Result: Prose能够为任意肽系统绘制零样本无相关性提案样本，实现了跨序列长度的可转移性，通过重要性采样微调在未见四肽上表现优于顺序蒙特卡洛等传统方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够设计可扩展和可转移的采样器，Prose作为提案机制在各种采样算法中表现出色，开源代码、模型权重和训练数据集将促进摊销采样方法的研究。

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as
a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance
sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to
established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We
open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further
stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

TL;DR: 通过多实例训练、适应性批处理DiLoCo和切换模式机制，提高异构硬件资源利用率和训练效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有分布式训练方法在动态工作负荷下无法充分利用计算集群资源的问题

Method: 三阶段方法：1)多实例训练允许节点并行运行多个训练流；2)适应性批处处理DiLoCo动态调整本地批量大小；3)切换模式机制在批量过大时引入梯度累积

Result: 提高了系统吞吐量、减少空闲时间、降低同步延迟，同时改善了收敛速度和系统效率

Conclusion: 该方法能够在动态工作负荷环境下更有效利用异构硬件资源，提供了可扩展的大语言模型训练方案

Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not
only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous
hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated
promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters
under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage
method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.
Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance
computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.
Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system
efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of
communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our
method.

TL;DR: 提出了基于双曲几何的Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER)回声状态网络，通过双曲距离的指数衰减连接来匹配混沌系统的拉伸-折叠结构，显著延长了混沌动力学的有效预测时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的回声状态网络(ESN)在处理混沌动力学时存在欧几里得几何与混沌的拉伸-折叠结构不匹配的问题，导致预测时间受限

Method: 在Poincare球中采样神经元，连接权重随双曲距离指数衰减，构建负曲率潜在空间，保持ESN的稀疏性、泄漏积分和谱半径控制等特性，仅训练Tikhonov正则化的读出层

Result: 在Lorenz-63、Roessler系统和Chen-Ueta超混沌吸引子上，HypER显著延长了平均有效预测时间，在30次独立运行中均获得统计显著增益，在心率变异性数据和太阳黑子数等真实世界基准测试中也表现出优势

Conclusion: 双曲几何嵌入的ESN能够更好地匹配混沌系统的动力学结构，为混沌时间序列预测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because
infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)
mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is
mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the
Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the
Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic
distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric
directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local
expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while
preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and
spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.
On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta
attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon
beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically
significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on
real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and
MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.
We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,
mirroring Lyapunov growth.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合深度学习和矩阵补全的方法，用于恢复物联网网络定位中受异常值污染的欧几里得距离矩阵，通过神经网络联合恢复距离矩阵和传感器坐标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定位技术在整个矩阵集合中搜索解，而本方法将搜索限制在欧几里得距离矩阵集合中，能更有效地处理异常值污染问题。

Method: 将距离矩阵D表示为传感器坐标矩阵X的函数，利用深度神经网络联合恢复D和X；将异常值建模为稀疏矩阵L，通过添加正则化项并交替更新X、D和L来求解优化问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，即使在存在异常值的情况下，该技术也能准确恢复传感器的位置信息。

Conclusion: 所提出的深度学习和矩阵补全方法能有效处理异常值污染，在物联网网络定位中实现准确的位置恢复。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided
approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in
IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that
search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique
restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,
we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently
satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a
deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse
matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We
then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location
information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

Motivation: 当前基于离散提示优化的LLM组合方法存在脆弱性问题，难以满足结构化任务的形式化合规要求

Method: 将整个工作流（参数高效适配的LLMs和确定性逻辑）视为未归一化联合分布，实现基于梯度的原则性训练，即使存在潜在中间结构

Conclusion: TACs为开发可靠、任务合规的LLM系统提供了一个鲁棒且理论基础坚实的范式

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step
workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing
discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce
the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce
Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow
adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire
workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and
deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables
principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.
We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective,
proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type
compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured
tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM
from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically
grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决评估对齐问题，在模块化预测系统中弥合预测评估与下游效用之间的差距。

Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently,
evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context
of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often
diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches
incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,
which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive
evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be
known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and
propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with
the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we
explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of
propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a
neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the
downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks
where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework
through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating
its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream
utility in modular prediction systems.

TL;DR: Ano是一个新颖的优化器，通过解耦方向和平滑来提升在非平稳和噪声环境中的鲁棒性，同时保持一阶方法的简单性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的优化器如Adam和Adan在非平稳或噪声环境中性能下降，主要因为它们依赖基于动量的幅度估计。

Method: Ano将方向和平滑解耦：使用动量进行方向平滑，而瞬时梯度幅度决定步长。Anolog进一步通过对数调度扩展动量窗口，消除对动量系数的敏感性。

Result: 理论分析建立了非凸收敛保证，收敛速率与其他基于符号的方法相似。实证显示Ano在噪声和非平稳环境（如强化学习）中表现优异，同时在低噪声任务（如计算机视觉基准）中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Ano优化器通过解耦方向和平滑的设计，显著提升了在噪声和非平稳环境中的鲁棒性，同时保持了简单性和效率，是一个有前景的优化方法。

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods
such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments,
partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We
introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude:
momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient
magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient
noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We
further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient
by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish
non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other
sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in
noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while
remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision
benchmarks.
