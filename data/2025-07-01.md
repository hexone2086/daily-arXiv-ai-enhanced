### [1] [Robust Perspective Correction for Real-World Crack Evolution Tracking in Image-Based Structural Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22437)
*Xinxin Sun,Peter Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，针对结构健康监测中的裂纹定位问题，通过非线性扩散和RANSAC实现高精度对齐，显著减少误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和复杂场景下表现不佳，需要一种更适应裂纹定位的方法。

Method: 采用非线性各向异性扩散构建裂纹保留尺度空间，结合RANSAC进行单应性估计，无需训练或参数调优。

Result: 在多种复杂场景下，裂纹面积和长度误差分别减少70%和90%，对齐误差低于5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为裂纹演化跟踪提供了一种鲁棒、轻量且物理基础明确的解决方案，适用于移动平台部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的害虫计数研究缺乏对实际场景中计数结果可靠性的评估，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合害虫检测网络、图像质量评估、复杂度评估和分布均匀性评估，通过回归模型预测计数置信度。

Conclusion: 本研究首次全面评估计数任务中的置信度，并通过模型量化影响因素与置信度的关系，为精准农业决策提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

### [3] [Modulated Diffusion: Accelerating Generative Modeling with Modulated Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22463)
*Weizhi Gao,Zhichao Hou,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang,Linyu Peng,Xiaorui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDiff是一种创新的扩散模型加速框架，通过调制量化和误差补偿提升生成效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高计算成本是主要瓶颈，现有加速技术（如缓存和量化）在计算误差和生成质量上存在局限。

Method: 提出MoDiff框架，结合调制量化和误差补偿，适用于所有扩散模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和LSUN上，MoDiff将激活量化从8位降至3位且性能无损。

Conclusion: MoDiff是一种高效且通用的扩散模型加速方法，具有理论支持和实验验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

### [4] [ViFusionTST: Deep Fusion of Time-Series Image Representations from Load Signals for Early Bed-Exit Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22498)
*Hao Liu,Yu Hu,Rakiba Rayhana,Ling Bai,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低成本负载传感器的床离意图预测方法，通过图像融合和双流Transformer模型ViFusionTST，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院和长期护理机构中，床相关跌倒是一个主要伤害来源，现有警报系统往往滞后。论文旨在通过早期预测床离意图来预防跌倒。

Method: 使用四个低成本负载传感器采集信号，转换为RGB线图和三种纹理图（递归图、马尔可夫转移场、格拉米安角场），并通过双流Swin Transformer模型ViFusionTST进行并行处理和跨注意力融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST达到0.885的准确率和0.794的F1分数，优于现有1D和2D时间序列基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载传感器信号分类是一种实用且有效的实时隐私保护跌倒预防解决方案。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

### [5] [Scalable Dynamic Origin-Destination Demand Estimation Enhanced by High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22499)
*Jiachao Liu,Pablo Guarda,Koichiro Niinuma,Sean Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卫星图像和传统交通数据的多类别动态起讫点需求估计框架，显著提升了无本地传感器路段的估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统本地传感器数据稀疏，卫星图像能提供更全面的城市交通信息，克服数据限制。

Method: 设计计算机视觉流程提取车辆类别信息，构建基于计算图的DODE模型，联合校准交通计数和旅行时间。

Result: 实验表明，卫星数据显著提升估计性能，尤其对无本地传感器的路段，且框架适用于大规模网络。

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际部署潜力，适用于不同规模城市，数据质量对卫星图像影响需进一步分析。

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

### [6] [Visual-Semantic Knowledge Conflicts in Operating Rooms: Synthetic Data Curation for Surgical Risk Perception in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22500)
*Weiyi Zhao,Xiaoyu Tan,Liang Liu,Sijia Li,Youwei Song,Xihe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对手术室风险检测的多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）视觉-语义知识冲突（VS-KC）问题的解决方案，通过生成合成图像数据集OR-VSKC，并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全和减少可预防医疗错误至关重要，但现有MLLMs在视觉安全违规检测中存在视觉-语义知识冲突问题。

Method: 通过扩散模型生成34,000多张合成图像，模拟手术室安全违规场景，并辅以214张人工标注图像作为验证基准。

Result: 在OR-VSKC数据集上微调的MLLMs显著提升了已知冲突实体的检测能力，但对未训练实体类型表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究贡献包括数据生成方法、开源数据集OR-VSKC及基准，以及对MLLMs知识一致性的实证分析。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at
https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于特定任务或数据集，难以泛化到多样化的遥感分类挑战。

Method: 利用Vision Transformers和多任务学习，结合数据增强、迁移学习等技术，增强模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 模型在分类准确性和可扩展性方面均有所提升。

Conclusion: SpatialNet-ViT通过结合空间感知和上下文理解，有效解决了遥感分类任务的泛化问题。

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence
detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二维位置数据无法全面捕捉盘带中的平衡、方向性和控球等关键因素，限制了分析的深度。

Method: 从2022/23赛季欧冠的1,736次盘带中提取基于姿态的新特征，并评估其对盘带成功的影响。

Result: 攻击者的平衡及与防守者的方向对齐等姿态特征对预测盘带成功具有信息量，结合传统二维数据后模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 三维姿态数据为足球盘带分析提供了更深入的视角，未来可扩展至其他技能评估。

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

*Hassan Baker,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督方法（Patch2Loc），通过训练神经网络从正常脑部MRI中学习，检测异常脑组织。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部病变检测对诊断和治疗至关重要，但监督学习方法需要标注数据，限制了应用。

Method: 训练神经网络将MRI中的正常脑组织补丁映射到其空间位置，通过预测误差检测异常。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，Patch2Loc在无监督分割中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch2Loc为无监督脑部异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Method: 通过聚类背景图像，生成反事实图像（将分割对象置于目标背景中），并利用样本差异和背景监督损失训练网络。

Result: 在声纳图像和自然图像上均优于无监督基线方法，且无需预训练网络或对抗训练。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督下有效，适用于多种图像领域，且避免了复杂模型依赖。

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

### [11] [FreeDNA: Endowing Domain Adaptation of Diffusion-Based Dense Prediction with Training-Free Domain Noise Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22509)

Conclusion: DNA是一种无需训练的高效域适应方法，适用于扩散密集预测框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用生成扩散模型，基于FY4B卫星的多波段热红外数据，开发了高精度的夜间可见光反射率检索模型RefDiff，显著提升了精度并提供了不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决夜间因缺乏可见光而无法进行全天候气象观测的问题。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星的AGRI多波段热红外数据，开发生成扩散模型RefDiff，实现夜间可见光反射率检索。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云结构和厚云区域表现显著提升，夜间检索能力与白天相当。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率检索能力，扩展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Conclusion: 该框架在实际测试中被专业评估者认可，具备作为检测流程支持工具的潜力。

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Motivation: 集装箱损伤是物流行业的安全隐患，及时检测可延长使用寿命并避免风险。

Method: 使用278张标注图像训练和测试模型，比较mAP和精度。

Result: Yolov11和12的mAP@50为81.9%，RF-DETR为77.7%，但RF-DETR在罕见损伤检测中表现更优。

Conclusion: RF-DETR在罕见损伤检测中表现最佳，适合集装箱损伤检测。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

TL;DR: 论文改进了Pix2Seq目标检测器，将其扩展到视频领域，提出了一种新的端到端视频目标检测方法，解决了传统检测器的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频目标检测器在训练和推理过程中存在稀疏损失和启发式后处理问题，且通常需要将2D框链接为视频对象，效率较低。

Method: 通过将对象表示为可变长度的离散标记序列，避免了传统检测器的框采样问题；同时直接输出3D框或轨迹，无需链接2D框。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于Pix2Seq静态检测器，并在UA-DETRAC上与当前最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频目标检测中表现出色，但受限于计算资源，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

TL;DR: MMKD-CLIP通过多教师知识蒸馏构建高性能生物医学基础模型，解决了数据稀缺和异构性问题，在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本数据集和统一标准，限制了基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，再从教师模型中提取1920万特征对进行特征级蒸馏。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在六类任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

Motivation: 农业图像语义分割对精准农业至关重要，需高效方法以支持决策和干预。

Method: 集成Dual Atrous Separable Convolution模块于DeepLabV3框架，并优化跳连结构以捕捉细粒度特征。

Result: 模型在Agriculture Vision数据集上性能优于基线，效率提升66%，接近复杂Transformer模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效轻量的语义分割解决方案，适用于农业遥感应用。

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

TL;DR: LIGHT是一种多模态方法，结合语言、图像和几何特征，用于链接历史地图上的文本，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对研究有重要价值，但现有方法难以有效链接文本片段，尤其是多词地名。

Method: LIGHT整合几何、视觉和语言特征，通过几何感知嵌入模块和多模态学习预测文本顺序。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习能有效提升历史地图文本链接的准确性。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法（如卷积神经网络或Transformer）难以建模fMRI数据中的复杂时空关系，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: BrainMT采用两阶段设计：1）双向Mamba块捕获全局时间交互；2）Transformer块建模全局空间关系。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类和回归任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效建模时空依赖关系，显著优于现有方法，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

<details>

Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习增强大型多模态模型在像素级任务（如前景分割）中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用GRPO策略，通过点提示和边界框提示引导SAM2生成分割掩码，仅使用RL训练。

Result: 在COD10K上达到0.873 S-measure，在RefCOCOg和ReasonSeg上实现零样本性能超越全监督模型。

Conclusion: 纯RL训练在分割任务中表现出高效性和泛化能力，为像素级理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块ReCo，用于缓解视觉语言模型（VLM）中的幻觉问题，通过几何代数和关系组合的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）在生成文本时容易产生幻觉，即生成与视觉输入无关或矛盾的文本，这被归因于对语言的过度依赖和视觉输入的‘记忆消退效应’。

Method: 在现有VLM上添加一个名为ReCo的小型可训练模块，无需其他修改，利用几何代数和关系组合来控制幻觉行为。

Result: 在三种主流VLM（InstructBLIP、LlaVA、MiniGPT4）上验证了ReCo模块的有效性，性能在多基准测试中均有提升，并能与其他减少幻觉的方法结合使用。

Conclusion: ReCo模块是一种轻量且通用的解决方案，能有效缓解VLM中的幻觉问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Result: CaO$_2$在ImageNet及其子集上表现最佳，平均准确率比基线方法高2.3%。

Conclusion: CaO$_2$通过优化蒸馏过程与评估目标的一致性，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Result: LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现出色且复杂度低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性可显著提升盲超分辨率模型的性能与效率。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

Motivation: 解决点云序列中部分分割和运动估计问题，特别是在点云动态采样或遮挡情况下，传统基于点对应的方法不适用。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态采样和遮挡场景下表现优异，优于传统基于点对应的方法。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且提供紧凑的置信区域，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

Result: XTransfer在多种人类感知任务中表现优异，显著降低了数据收集、模型训练和边缘部署的成本。

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统中的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

TL;DR: UniFuse是一个多模态医学图像融合框架，通过降解感知提示学习模块和Omni统一特征表示方案，解决了图像未对齐或质量差的问题，实现了对齐、恢复和融合的一体化优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设源图像高质量且对齐，但在实际应用中，图像可能未对齐或质量差，导致融合效果下降。

Method: UniFuse结合降解感知提示学习、Omni统一特征表示和Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion模块，利用ALSN实现自适应特征表示和联合优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，UniFuse在多个数据集上优于现有方法，实现了对齐、恢复和融合的一体化。

Conclusion: UniFuse通过统一框架解决了多模态医学图像融合中的对齐和恢复问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Motivation: 彩色点云是3D应用的主流表示，但生成大规模且密集的彩色点云仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出JGAU框架，包括几何上采样网络和属性上采样网络，并引入两种粗属性上采样方法和属性增强模块。

Result: 在4倍、8倍、12倍和16倍上采样率下，PSNR分别达到33.90、32.10、31.10和30.39分贝，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JGAU方法在彩色点云上采样任务中表现出显著优势，为3D应用提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

Method: 采用多路径扩散框架，结合正、中、负提示路径平衡高频细节生成与结构保真度，并引入伪数据增强和可调解码器。SVDA模块自适应建模光学和传感器退化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自然图像先验和可控推理过程，有效解决了金属透镜摄影中的退化问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Conclusion: RoboPearls为机器人操作提供了一种高效、可扩展的仿真解决方案，显著提升了仿真与现实的衔接能力。

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

Motivation: 现有CNN和Transformer方法在视频超分辨率中存在局部感受野或计算复杂度高的问题，Mamba因其长序列建模能力和线性复杂度成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出VSRM框架，包含空间-时间和时间-空间Mamba块、可变形交叉Mamba对齐模块，以及频率Charbonnier-like损失函数。

Conclusion: VSRM为视频超分辨率提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于无检测器匹配框架的方法，用于直接实现LiDAR点云与相机图像之间的点像素配准，解决了单帧LiDAR稀疏性和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云与图像之间的模态差异以及单帧LiDAR的稀疏性和噪声是现有方法的主要挑战，需要更有效的跨模态匹配策略。

Method: 通过将LiDAR强度图投影到2D视图，并利用基于注意力的无检测器匹配网络实现跨模态对应估计，同时引入可重复性评分机制提升匹配可靠性。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和MIAS-LCEC-TF70基准测试中，该方法表现优异，优于依赖多帧点云累积的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为单帧LiDAR下的点像素配准提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了匹配性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

Motivation: 单次驾驶片段常导致道路结构扫描不完整，需扩展重建以提升传感器模拟器的驾驶动作回归效果。

Method: 提出奖励网络筛选扩散输出以确保空间稳定性，并采用差异化训练策略优化高斯重建过程。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RGE-GS实现了最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过奖励引导和自适应训练策略，显著提升了重建性能和效率。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

Motivation: 深度模型复杂度增加导致解释性下降，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅针对样本级别。

Method: 利用概念瓶颈模型（CBM）作为解释性框架，识别并修正有害概念，将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升模型解释性和性能，为深度学习的可解释性提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Result: 实验表明，CPE在删除名人、艺术风格和敏感内容方面优于现有方法，同时保持其他概念的多样性。

Conclusion: CPE提供了一种更有效且鲁棒的概念删除方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance

Method: 扩展固定比例裁剪算法，动态调整注意力阈值并移除已选区域，线性时间内提取多区域。

Result: 实现了高效的多区域裁剪，无需重复计算显著性图。

Abstract: Automatic image cropping aims to extract the most visually salient regions
while preserving essential composition elements. Traditional saliency-aware
cropping methods optimize a single bounding box, making them ineffective for
applications requiring multiple disjoint crops. In this work, we extend the
Fixed Aspect Ratio Cropping algorithm to efficiently extract multiple
non-overlapping crops in linear time. Our approach dynamically adjusts
attention thresholds and removes selected crops from consideration without
recomputing the entire saliency map. We discuss qualitative results and
introduce the potential for future datasets and benchmarks.

*Tianran Liu,Shengwen Zhao,Nicholas Rhinehart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了LiDAR世界模型的跨领域迁移能力，提出了一种基于条件流匹配的框架，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LiDAR世界模型在多领域中的可迁移性，减少对标注数据的依赖，并解决现有模型的低效问题。

Method: 采用潜在条件流匹配（CFM）框架，优化LiDAR数据压缩和训练目标。

Result: 模型在多个任务中表现优异，仅需5%标注数据即可超越先前模型，计算效率提升23倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了LiDAR世界模型的跨领域性能和效率，为实际应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

TL;DR: MVOV3D提出了一种新方法，通过减少2D多视图融合中的固有噪声，提升开放词汇3D场景理解能力，无需训练即可保留泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限词汇量下表现良好，但难以处理多样化的对象类别，且3D数据量有限制约了开放词汇3D模型的训练。

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码器提取精确的区域级图像和文本特征，并结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Matterport160上，MVOV3D分别实现了14.7%和16.2%的mIoU，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MVOV3D通过优化2D多视图融合，显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D
networks by a significant margin.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个大规模真实世界数据集，用于个性化端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD），并通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和人工验证生成高质量偏好标注，为个性化E2EAD研究奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化在传统自动驾驶系统中已有研究，但在端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）中被忽视，而用户对齐行为对自动驾驶的信任和普及至关重要。缺乏大规模标注数据集是主要挑战。

Method: 从真实道路拓扑中提取静态环境特征，使用微调的VLM推断动态上下文线索，通过行为分布分析和规则启发式生成客观偏好标注，并利用VLM生成主观标注，最后通过人工验证融合两者。

Result: 提出的数据集和评估基准显示，结合个性化偏好的模型行为更接近人类驾驶。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化E2EAD提供了标准化平台，推动了以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进视觉语言模型（VLM）测试时提示调优（TPT）的方法，通过基于大语言模型（LLM）的提示初始化和新颖的正则化损失，显著提升了模型的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TPT方法在提升准确率时忽视了置信度校准问题，限制了其在关键应用中的适用性。

Method: 1. 使用LLM初始化测试时提示以避免过拟合；2. 提出正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，该方法将平均预期校准误差（ECE）从11.7降至4.11，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 通过合理的提示初始化和正则化，TPT的校准性能得到显著提升，增强了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型泛化能力不足，且监督微调易导致记忆化问题，需要复杂标注流程。强化学习（如GRPO）虽能提升泛化性，但在推理一致性上存在缺陷。

Method: 引入听众增强的GRPO框架，利用冻结的视觉语言模型（听众）重新评估推理链，生成密集校准的置信度评分，优化强化学习奖励信号。

Result: 在ImageReward基准测试中达到67.4%的准确率，在大规模人类偏好数据集上OOD性能提升6%，并减少了推理矛盾。

Conclusion: 听众增强的奖励机制为视觉语言模型与人类偏好对齐提供了可扩展且高效的数据路径。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

TL;DR: SemFaceEdit是一种基于生成辐射流形的新方法，通过语义场实现面部图像的局部编辑，解决了3D感知GAN在局部编辑上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D感知GAN技术虽然提供多视角一致性，但缺乏局部编辑能力。生成辐射流形虽能减少计算需求并学习细节，但仍需改进以实现更精确的语义编辑。

Method: SemFaceEdit通过几何模块和外观模块联合训练，生成语义辐射场和RGB辐射场，利用潜在码解耦几何与外观，实现局部编辑。

Result: 实验表明，SemFaceEdit在语义场编辑和辐射场解耦方面表现优异，能精确编辑特定面部语义而不影响其他区域。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit通过语义场和潜在码的结合，实现了面部图像的精确局部编辑，为3D感知生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Conclusion: FOCUS方法能够自适应提取细粒度属性级特征，显著提升了行人属性识别的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) across aerial and ground vantage points has
become crucial for large-scale surveillance and public safety applications.
Although significant progress has been made in ground-only scenarios, bridging
the aerial-ground domain gap remains a formidable challenge due to extreme
viewpoint differences, scale variations, and occlusions. Building upon the
achievements of the AG-ReID 2023 Challenge, this paper introduces the AG-VPReID
2025 Challenge - the first large-scale video-based competition focused on
high-altitude (80-120m) aerial-ground ReID. Constructed on the new AG-VPReID
dataset with 3,027 identities, over 13,500 tracklets, and approximately 3.7
million frames captured from UAVs, CCTV, and wearable cameras, the challenge
featured four international teams. These teams developed solutions ranging from
multi-stream architectures to transformer-based temporal reasoning and
physics-informed modeling. The leading approach, X-TFCLIP from UAM, attained
72.28% Rank-1 accuracy in the aerial-to-ground ReID setting and 70.77% in the

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上验证，检索准确性和分割质量均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务和提出的框架有效结合了TIR和RES，实现了高效且准确的图像检索和对象分割。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal

spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

TL;DR: DeSa2VA提出了一种解耦增强的提示方案，通过文本预训练和线性解耦模块，解决了现有视频分割和接地方法中动态视觉信息与静态语义纠缠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Sa2VA）直接将特征融合到分割模型中，导致动态视觉信息与静态语义纠缠，降低了分割准确性。

Method: 1. 设计预训练范式，将文本标签转换为点级提示并生成文本掩码；2. 使用线性投影将大语言模型的隐藏状态解耦为文本和视觉特征子空间；3. 动态掩码融合策略结合解耦特征。

Result: 在图像分割、图像问答、视频分割和视频问答等任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和动态融合，显著提升了分割和接地任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对比学习的语义信息量度量方法，用于评估图像和文本的绝对语义信息量，并重新定义了信息增益的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对比学习是否能表示绝对语义信息量，而不仅仅是关系语义相似性。

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的语义信息量，提出基于嵌入的信息增益度量方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，信息增益分数低的图像通常为占位图标（如“未找到图像”），且信息增益与嵌入范数强相关（R²=0.98-1.00）。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适用于公开模型，为评估多模态语义信息量提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测恶意代理并提升系统可靠性。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了一种统一的防御框架，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code

Motivation: NCA在低分辨率网格上表现出色，但在高分辨率下存在训练时间长、信息传播受限和计算需求高的问题。

Conclusion: 结合隐式解码器的NCA框架能够高效扩展到高分辨率任务，适用于多种变体和应用场景。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在MedVQA中常生成错误答案，且传统检索增强方法可能引入无关上下文，忽略多模态信息的重要性。

Method: MOTOR利用基于文本和视觉信息的检索重排序方法，结合基础描述和最优传输技术，捕捉查询与上下文的多模态关系。

Result: 实验和专家评估显示，MOTOR在MedVQA数据集上平均准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态检索和重排序显著提升了MedVQA的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

Result: 实验表明，MagShield显著提高了磁干扰下的运动捕捉准确性，并具有良好的兼容性。

Conclusion: MagShield能有效提升稀疏惯性运动捕捉系统在磁干扰环境中的性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

TL;DR: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) 是一种参数高效的微调技术，通过在学习输入空间中的少量参数（称为提示）来适应预训练的视觉 Transformer (ViT)。研究发现，图像块嵌入与 Transformer 自注意力模块中的键和查询投影器之间的交互会产生“突发性”值，且这些值的分布为非高斯分布，增加了学习提示的难度。为解决这一问题，提出了数据白化方法，通过去相关和方差均衡化使其更接近高斯分布。进一步提出了双线性提示调优（BPT），显著加速了提示学习并提高了准确性，同时减少了参数数量和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉 Transformer 在微调时存在非高斯分布的数据特性，增加了提示学习的难度，因此需要一种方法来优化数据分布以提高学习效率和准确性。

Method: 提出数据白化方法，通过去相关和方差均衡化使数据更接近高斯分布，并引入双线性提示调优（BPT），通过低秩矩阵分解减少参数数量和计算开销。

Result: BPT 方法在多个基准数据集上显著优于各种 VPT 方法，例如在 CUB 数据集上准确率提高了 25 个百分点以上，同时减少了参数数量和计算开销。

Conclusion: BPT 方法通过优化数据分布和引入低秩分解，显著提高了提示学习的效率和准确性，同时降低了计算成本，为视觉 Transformer 的微调提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in

Motivation: 解决AI生成内容的水印易被篡改和绕过的问题，特别是针对视觉转述攻击的脆弱性。

Method: PECCAVI通过在多通道频域嵌入水印，并利用噪声抛光技术保护非熔化点（NMPs），防止水印被移除。

Result: PECCAVI能有效抵抗视觉转述攻击，保持图像无失真，且模型无关。

Conclusion: PECCAVI为AI生成内容提供了一种安全、耐用的水印解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: 结合结构化语言先验和经典对齐技术，为细粒度视频理解提供了一种可扩展的通用方法。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法具有确定性，难以适应多样样本，尤其是标注稀缺的新类别。

Method: FewCLIP引入原型校准机制和分布正则化，优化多模态原型学习。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准提升了GFSS的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在对抗攻击中的脆弱性，验证了CroPA方法的跨提示迁移性，并提出了改进策略以提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度敏感，尤其是在视觉和文本模态均可被操纵的场景中。

Method: 研究验证了CroPA方法，并提出三项改进：新颖的初始化策略、跨图像迁移性研究、针对视觉编码器注意力机制的损失函数。

Result: 改进后的方法在多个VLMs（如Flamingo、BLIP-2等）上验证了原始结果，并显著提升了对抗攻击效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了研究VLMs对抗漏洞的重要性，并为生成可迁移对抗样本提供了更鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image
score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images
for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

TL;DR: AugPaint是一种数据增强框架，利用潜在扩散模型生成高质量的图像-标签对，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集的像素级标注成本高且耗时，如何在标注数据稀缺的情况下提升分割性能是一个关键挑战。

Method: AugPaint通过潜在扩散模型进行图像修复，生成与标签掩模匹配的合成图像，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在四个公共医学图像分割数据集上的评估表明，AugPaint优于现有方法，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: AugPaint为标注数据稀缺的医学图像分割任务提供了一种高效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射中高斯基元数量增长导致的内存和带宽压力问题。

Method: 使用可学习的离散小波变换，固定低通滤波器，学习高通滤波器，并通过正交性损失逐步激活高频细节。

Result: AutoOpti3DGS生成更稀疏的场景表示，兼容内存受限硬件，且仅需一个超参数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了视觉质量与内存效率，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Method: 采用基于扩散的视觉解码器和双向令牌细化器，从语言模型开始进行统一训练。

Result: 在OpenCompass等多项基准测试中表现优异，超越Ristretto-3B等模型。

Conclusion: Ovis-U1作为系列首版，在多模态任务中表现出色，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SVLMs参数容量有限和指令跟随能力弱，现有训练范式（如SFT和RLVR）难以直接应用，导致伪思考痕迹和优势崩溃，影响模型可靠性和任务表现。

Method: 提出DyME训练范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，确保每次优化更新都能平衡两者，避免次优收敛。

Result: 实验表明DyME能有效平衡记忆与探索，显著提升SVLMs的可靠思考能力和任务性能。

Conclusion: DyME是一种实用且有效的解决方案，能够增强SVLMs的可靠思考能力。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Conclusion: CoreMark为文本水印提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

Conclusion: CDAL通过最大化因果效应，鼓励网络捕捉泛化到未见源模型的生成模式，提升模型归属性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要关注跨域图像匹配的准确性，而忽略了全面捕捉目标周围上下文信息及减少定位误差成本的需求。

Method: 构建DA-Campus基准数据集，将DACVGL问题定义为跨域分层检索问题，并提出动态对比学习框架（DyCL）逐步对齐特征表示。

Result: DyCL在分层检索性能和跨视角地理定位准确性上均有显著提升，且与现有多尺度度量学习方法高度互补。

Conclusion: DyCL通过动态对比学习有效解决了DACVGL问题，为跨视角地理定位提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

TL;DR: DC-TTA是一种新颖的测试时适应框架，通过用户交互监督优化SAM，显著提升复杂场景下的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中的性能不足问题。

Method: 将用户交互划分为更一致的子集，每个子集通过独立的TTA模型处理，最后合并为统一预测器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DC-TTA显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，减少了交互次数并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分而治之策略有效提升了SAM在复杂任务中的表现，为交互式分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多笔画汉字对非母语学习者难度大，简化后能降低学习门槛、优化字体设计并提升字符通信效率。

Method: 利用高精度字符识别模型评估可读性，选择性去除对可读性影响最小的笔画。

Result: 在1,256个字符类别上的实验表明，即使去除多笔画，许多字符仍可区分。

Conclusion: 研究为汉字简化提供了潜在策略，支持更系统化的简化方法。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CVC-RF的新框架，通过多级细化（Corpus、View、Category）提升颈动脉斑块分级（CPG）的性能，结合对比损失、注意力模块和专家加权策略，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉斑块分级（CPG）对评估心脑血管疾病风险至关重要，但现有深度学习方法忽视了表示学习和类别特征的差异。

Method: 提出CVC-RF框架，包括中心记忆对比损失（Corpus级）、级联下采样注意力模块（View级）和无参数专家加权策略（Category级）。

Result: 实验表明CVC-RF通过多级细化有效建模全局特征，在CPG任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CVC-RF通过多级细化显著提升了CPG任务的性能，为临床实践提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

TL;DR: MoCa是一个两阶段框架，通过改进预训练的因果视觉语言模型（VLMs）来解决当前多模态嵌入模型的局限性，包括注意力机制、数据依赖性和训练目标多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入模型存在三个主要问题：因果注意力机制不适用于嵌入任务、依赖高质量标注数据导致可扩展性差、训练目标和数据多样性不足。

Method: MoCa分为两阶段：1）模态感知的持续预训练，通过联合重建目标增强双向上下文推理；2）异构对比微调，利用多样化多模态数据提升泛化和对齐能力。

Result: MoCa在MMEB和ViDoRe-v2基准测试中表现优异，达到新SOTA结果，并在模型规模和训练数据上展示强可扩展性。

Conclusion: MoCa通过双向注意力、大规模无标签数据和多样化训练目标，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Result: R²S和3D ReasonSeg显著提升了3D点云感知的空间推理能力，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: R²S和3D ReasonSeg为未来研究提供了新的基准和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Conclusion: 方法有效但需权衡检索性能与准确率，未来研究方向包括进一步优化模型。

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有提示工程方法虽能提升图像风格和美学，但常忽视语义对齐，导致生成图像内容不满足用户需求。

Method: 提出VisualPrompter框架，包含自动反思模块识别缺失概念，以及目标特定提示优化机制细粒度修订提示。

Result: 在多个文本-图像对齐评估基准上达到新最优性能，且具有即插即用设计。

Conclusion: VisualPrompter有效解决了语义对齐问题，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

TL;DR: AlignCVC提出了一种新的单图像到3D生成框架，通过分布对齐而非严格回归损失来提升跨视图一致性（CVC）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，多视图图像生成缺乏跨视图一致性，导致3D重建性能下降。现有方法通过反馈重建结果改进CVC，但受限于噪声和不稳定的输出。

Method: AlignCVC通过软硬对齐策略，将生成和重建的多视图分布与真实多视图分布对齐，分别优化生成和重建模型的目标。

Result: 实验表明，AlignCVC显著提升了生成质量和推理速度（仅需4步），并能无缝集成多种多视图生成和3D重建模型。

Conclusion: AlignCVC为单图像到3D生成提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案，通过分布对齐显著改善了跨视图一致性。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光流估计中高精度与高GPU内存消耗之间的矛盾，尤其是在高分辨率输入下。

Method: 通过优化RAFT-like架构的设计选择，包括减少相关性体积和高分辨率训练协议，结合多帧估计，实现内存高效的光流估计。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如Spring、Sintel和KITTI-2015，同时运行时仅需2.09GB GPU内存（训练时28.5GB）。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在保持高精度的同时显著降低内存需求，适用于高分辨率光流估计。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

Conclusion: DDR方法有效解决了相机运动受限时的场景表示问题，提升了新视角合成的质量。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在线性微调和迁移学习中验证了方法的竞争力，尽管样本质量和数量有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签图像上表现出色，减少了预训练开销并提升了语义表示能力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HAMW方法有效提升了人物搜索任务的性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BridgeShape提出了一种基于潜在扩散Schrödinger桥的3D形状补全框架，通过显式建模最优全局传输路径和紧凑的潜在空间编码，解决了现有方法在分辨率和几何细节上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能显式建模最优全局传输路径，且受限于体素空间的分辨率约束，导致补全效果不佳。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状到紧凑潜在空间，结合多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最先进性能，支持更高分辨率和未见物体类别的补全。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过优化传输路径和潜在空间编码，显著提升了3D形状补全的效率和保真度。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

TL;DR: TVG-SLAM是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的RGB-only SLAM系统，通过三视图几何范式提升跟踪和建图的鲁棒性，适用于复杂户外环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-only SLAM系统依赖光度渲染损失，在户外无边界环境中因视角和光照变化导致鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出三视图匹配模块和混合几何约束，结合光度损失；引入概率初始化策略和动态渲染信任衰减机制。

Result: 在多个户外数据集上表现优异，显著降低轨迹误差（ATE减少69.0%），渲染质量达到SOTA。

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM通过几何约束和动态机制显著提升了RGB-only SLAM的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification,
incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for

and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Motivation: 当前方法依赖稀疏点级标签生成伪标签，但仅基于场景级标注生成准确伪标签具有挑战性，影响了分割性能。

Method: 提出跨模态特征引导模块和区域-点语义一致性模块，利用2D-3D对应关系和区域投票策略优化伪标签生成。

Conclusion: 通过多模态信息和语义一致性模块，本文方法能够生成高质量伪标签，提升场景级标注下的点云语义分割性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolumetricSMPL是一种基于神经混合权重（NBW）的神经体积人体模型，显著提升了计算效率和表达能力，适用于多种复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人体模型使用表面网格，难以高效处理与其他几何实体的交互，而现有的体积神经隐式模型在复杂人体动作或计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 提出VolumetricSMPL，利用NBW动态混合少量学习权重矩阵，生成紧凑高效的MLP解码器，支持SDF建模。

Result: 相比COAP模型，VolumetricSMPL推理速度快10倍，GPU内存占用低6倍，精度更高，适用于多种任务。

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在性能、效率和广泛适用性上表现优异，为人体建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

*James Hinns,David Martens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Segment Attribution Tables (SATs)，通过总结局部显著性解释提供半全局见解，填补了过于简化的全局方法与过于详细的局部解释之间的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像分类中表现优异，但模型预测的可解释性仍具挑战性。现有方法或过于局部（如显著性图），或过于全局而忽略重要局部行为。

Method: 提出SATs方法，利用图像片段（如“眼睛”）和显著性图量化其影响，揭示模型依赖的概念和虚假相关性。

Result: SATs能够解释任何可生成显著性图的分类器，提供实用工具分析图像分类器。

Conclusion: SATs填补了全局与局部解释之间的空白，为图像分类器的分析和调试提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Conclusion: DGE-YOLO在多模态无人机目标检测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在图像超分辨率中真实感与计算效率的权衡问题，特别是在减少采样步骤时导致图像模糊和不真实的情况。

Method: 引入布朗运动的随机性到训练中，避免局部最优，采用sigmoidal噪声序列方法简化训练并加速推理。

Result: 在LPIPS、LOE、PSNR、SSIM等指标上表现优异，边缘重建能力更强，视觉质量更高。

Conclusion: PixelBoost通过控制随机性和自适应学习，显著提升了图像超分辨率的真实感和计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模拟在超级计算机上的通信延迟问题严重，现有方法依赖管理员才能获取的物理链路层信息，限制了普通用户的分析能力。

Method: PCLVis利用MPI通信数据，通过构建进程相关树和通信依赖DAG，结合滑动窗口算法和CS-Glyph可视化通信状态。

Result: 在TH-1A超级计算机上的实验表明，PCLVis能有效分析通信延迟事件并优化模拟效率。

Conclusion: PCLVis为普通用户提供了一种无需物理链路层信息的通信延迟分析工具，显著提升了模拟效率。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn通过精确识别事故参与者和行为，显著提升了合成视频的因果敏感性，为自动驾驶安全测试提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Token Activation Map (TAM)的方法，通过估计因果推理和秩高斯滤波器来减少多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)解释中的冗余激活干扰，显著提升了解释的可信度和可视化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的解释性研究不足，冗余的上下文激活干扰了后续令牌的解释，影响了模型的可信度和可视化效果。

Method: 提出TAM方法，结合估计因果推理和秩高斯滤波器，减少冗余激活干扰，优化MLLMs的解释质量。

Result: TAM在多种场景下显著优于现有方法，如目标定位、失败案例分析、视频可视化等。

Conclusion: TAM为MLLMs提供高质量的可视化解释，提升了模型的可信度和理解深度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将空间和时间信息分开处理，难以捕捉视频动态的复杂性，因此需要一种更高效的全时空建模方法。

Method: 提出SeqMod操作，将时空信息注入预训练的IFMs中，同时保持原始特征不变，结合Divide-and-Modulate架构实现高效建模。

Result: 在多个视频基准测试中表现优异，性能提升且计算成本降低。

Conclusion: MoMa通过全时空建模显著提升了视频理解能力，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: DDL数据集填补了现有数据集的不足，为深度伪造检测的可靠性和解释性提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在服装细节保留、对齐精度、效率和多样性上存在不足，DiffFit旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DiffFit采用两阶段策略：第一阶段进行几何感知的服装变形，第二阶段通过跨模态条件扩散模型优化纹理保真度。

Result: DiffFit在大规模虚拟试穿基准测试中表现优于现有方法，定量和感知评估均显示其优越性。

Conclusion: DiffFit通过解耦几何对齐和外观优化，显著提升了虚拟试穿的生成稳定性和视觉真实感。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

TL;DR: Endo-4DGX是一种新型重建方法，通过光照自适应的高斯泼溅技术，解决了内窥镜场景中光照不均的问题，提升了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像引导机器人手术中，软组织的精确重建至关重要。现有3D高斯泼溅技术在极端光照条件下表现不佳，影响了渲染质量。

Method: Endo-4DGX结合光照嵌入、区域感知增强模块和空间感知调整模块，实现了光照自适应的优化。

Result: 实验表明，Endo-4DGX在低光和过曝条件下显著优于现有方法，同时保持几何精度。

Conclusion: Endo-4DGX在挑战性光照环境中表现出色，有望推动机器人辅助手术的应用。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lastbasket/Endo-4DGX.

TL;DR: FastSeg是一种无需训练的高效框架，通过预训练的扩散模型实现开放词汇语义分割，结合双提示机制和分层注意力优化，显著提升了分割质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放词汇语义分割中全局表示偏差导致的空间精度损失问题，同时平衡扩散模型的迭代次数与分割质量。

Method: 提出FastSeg框架，仅需预训练扩散模型的(1+1)步反向过程，结合双提示机制、分层注意力细化方法（HARD）和测试时翻转（TTF）方案。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC、PASCAL Context和COCO Object基准测试中，平均mIoU达到43.8%，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: FastSeg在分割质量和推理效率之间取得了平衡，为扩展性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

TL;DR: IR3D-Bench是一个新的基准测试，通过要求视觉语言模型（VLMs）主动使用工具重建图像的3D结构，评估其场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在描述性任务上表现出色，但其是否真正理解场景仍不确定。因此，需要一种新的评估方法，通过主动创建而非被动识别来验证其理解能力。

Method: 基于分析-合成范式，IR3D-Bench要求视觉语言代理（VLAs）使用编程和渲染工具重建输入图像的3D结构，实现逆向渲染。

Result: 初步实验显示，当前VLMs在视觉精度上存在局限，而非基本工具使用。

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench为系统研究和开发工具使用的VLAs提供了数据与评估协议，推动通过创建实现真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight
current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool
usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to
facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine
scene understanding by creating.

TL;DR: 论文提出CycleVAR，一种基于Softmax Relaxed Quantization的无监督图像翻译方法，通过连续概率混合保留梯度传播，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于向量量化的方法因离散量化阻碍梯度传播，限制了无监督图像翻译的性能。

Method: 采用Softmax Relaxed Quantization实现连续概率混合，提出CycleVAR框架，支持串行多步和并行单步生成模式。

Result: 并行单步生成模式在质量和速度上优于串行模式，CycleVAR超越现有方法如CycleGAN-Turbo。

Conclusion: CycleVAR通过改进量化方法和生成模式，显著提升了无监督图像翻译的效果。

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单主体场景，且缺乏对多主体训练数据和控制信号（如深度、遮罩等）的探索。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出VideoCus-Factory数据构造管道生成多主体训练数据，结合IVTM混合训练策略，并开发了OmniVCus框架，包含Lottery Embedding和Temporally Aligned Embedding机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文通过数据构造和框架创新，成功实现了多主体视频定制和控制信号的有效利用。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Motivation: 解决INR视频编码速度慢的问题，同时不牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制能力。

Method: 采用共享编码器捕获全局低频特征，并行训练轻量级离散解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，编码速度提升20-30倍，保持高质量重建和压缩比。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升了高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率优势（PoS）的新框架，用于改进文本到图像模型在空间关系生成中的准确性，包括新的评估指标PSE和生成方法PSG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型在生成复杂空间关系时的不足，尤其是空间配置的准确性。

Method: 1. 提出PoS-based Evaluation (PSE)作为评估指标；2. 提出PoS-based Generation (PSG)作为推理时方法，无需微调。

Result: PSE指标与人类判断更一致，PSG显著提升了空间关系生成的准确性。

Conclusion: PoS框架有效提升了文本到图像模型的空间关系生成能力，PSE和PSG方法优于现有技术。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对象危害性而非传统分类的自动驾驶车辆目标检测方法，以应对未知物体的检测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法无法有效识别未知物体（OOD），可能导致安全隐患，如误判或漏检危险物体。

Method: 通过对象位置和轨迹判断其危害性（有害/无害），而非具体类别分类。

Result: 模型能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，提升自动驾驶决策安全性。

Conclusion: 新方法显著增强了自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中的实时决策能力。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Result: PathDiff生成的图像质量高、语义准确，显著提升了图像保真度、文本对齐和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: PathDiff在病理图像生成中优于现有方法，为数据增强和下游任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

Motivation: 传统CAM方法在弱监督语义分割中存在部分激活和边界不精确的问题，而扩散模型生成的显著性图易受背景噪声干扰。

Method: 提出CLDF方法，利用对比学习训练像素解码器，将冻结扩散模型的特征映射到低维嵌入空间，并结合梯度图和CAMs减少误判。

Result: 在两个公共医学数据集的四个分割任务中，CLDF显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CLDF通过结合扩散模型和对比学习，有效提升了弱监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: 传统参考图像修复方法在处理时间变化图像时效果不佳，因为参考图像与目标图像内容差异大且可能受损。TAMP任务在现实生活中常见，但缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 提出InDiTE模块自适应补充语义信息，并整合扩散模型（InDiTE-Diff），在采样时进行潜在交叉参考。

Result: 在TAMP-Street数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有参考图像修复方法。

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff为时间变化图像修复提供了有效解决方案，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业应用中，大规模数据集常因标签噪声和不一致性影响模型性能，而高质量标签获取成本高。

Result: 实验证明VLSR能有效识别问题标签并提升一致性，减少标签词汇量。

Conclusion: VLSR显著提升工业应用数据集质量，减少人工干预。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Method: 提出AdFair-CLIP框架，利用对抗性特征干预抑制敏感属性，减少虚假相关性。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上，AdFair-CLIP显著提高了公平性和诊断准确性，并在零样本和少样本场景中保持稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型设定了公平性学习的新标准。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

Conclusion: GVIT通过高斯表示和梯度指导，实现了高效且性能接近传统方法的分类。

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional

learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Motivation: Chamfer Distance（CD）仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特性，因此需要一种更准确的度量方法。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知且完全可微的测地线距离近似方法，用于3D点云学习。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在各种架构和数据集上均显著提升了重建质量，仅需单轮微调即可在多指标上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: GeoCD是一种有效的替代CD的度量方法，能够更好地捕捉3D几何特性。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,

traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，通过FID和LPIPS等指标验证。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: MTADiffusion通过改进语义对齐、结构稳定性和风格一致性，显著提升了对象修复的效果。

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对抗训练方法PBCAT，用于防御物体检测器中的多种物理可实现攻击，显著提升了鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物体检测在安全敏感应用中至关重要，但易受物理可实现攻击（如对抗性补丁和纹理）的威胁。现有对抗训练方法主要针对分类模型，对物体检测器的防御研究不足。

Method: 提出PBCAT方法，结合小区域梯度引导对抗补丁和全局不可察觉扰动，优化模型以防御多种攻击。

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著提升了对抗多种物理可实现攻击的鲁棒性，检测准确率比现有方法提高29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT为物体检测器提供了一种统一的对抗训练策略，有效防御多种物理可实现攻击。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在图像-文本匹配任务中表现出色，但缺乏对细粒度细节（如对象属性和空间关系）的理解，尤其是动作感知能力。

Method: 设计了动作三元组提示和动作状态提示，利用LLM生成的动作相关知识，并提出自适应交互模块以聚合视觉特征。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入LLM增强的提示调优方法，显著提升了CLIP在动作感知任务中的表现。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在六个真实领域评估中，发现鲁棒性存在显著差异，强调需要针对性评估。

Conclusion: Deepbench开源以支持领域感知鲁棒性评估的进一步研究。

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by
up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation
strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and
effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.

Conclusion: Mamba-FETrack V2在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了模态差距问题，为全景视频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上，SPROD平均AUROC提升4.7%，FPR@95降低9.3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPROD有效解决了虚假相关性对OOD检测的影响，具有广泛适用性和显著性能优势。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Conclusion: 通过注视信息和弱监督学习，显著提升了视频显著物体检测的性能。

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级设计有效提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在合成DVToF数据集上达到最优性能，并在真实Kinectv2数据集上表现出鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提方法在ToF深度去噪中实现了高精度和一致性，且网络可解释性强。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

Conclusion: PPFlow是一种高效且灵活的DiTs优化方法，适用于从头训练或微调预训练模型。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

*Jiwon Kim,Soohyun Hwang,Dong-O Kim,Changsu Han,Min Kyu Park,Chang-Su Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Oneta的多风格图像增强算法，通过两步操作（强度增强和色彩校正）实现高性能，支持多种风格任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务，通过简单但高效的两步模型实现广泛适用性。

Method: 使用Y-Net和C-Net预测参数，引入eigenTF紧凑表示，通过K个可学习令牌支持多风格。

Result: 在30个数据集上成功完成六种增强任务，表现优异。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种高效、通用的多风格图像增强方法。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将面部运动合成和语音合成视为独立任务，忽略了二者的内在联系。

Method: 采用流匹配和MM-DiT架构，结合Motion-DiT和Audio-DiT模块，通过选择性联合注意力层实现跨模态交互。

Result: JAM-Flow支持多种任务（如文本驱动的同步头部生成），显著提升了多模态生成建模。

Conclusion: JAM-Flow为音频-视觉合成提供了实用的整体解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.
JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a
practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:

*Fan Xie,Pan Cao*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LH2Face的新型损失函数，通过结合vMF分布和自适应边距策略，优化了高质量困难样本的人脸识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别方法在处理困难样本时表现不佳，且未考虑人脸质量或识别难度。

Method: 提出vMF分布相似性度量，设计自适应边距的softmax分类方法，并结合代理损失函数和渲染器优化表示空间分布。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上达到49.39%的准确率，优于第二名2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应策略和表示空间优化，显著提升了高质量困难样本的识别性能。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体中心辐射场（OcRF）的多视角3D物体检测方法，通过增强3D体素特征和2D BEV特征，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过深度估计或3D位置编码将2D特征隐式转换到3D空间，限制了检测性能。作者认为辐射场可以增强3D几何估计能力，但直接使用会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF），专注于前景物体建模，忽略背景噪声；并利用渲染的副产品不透明度，通过高度感知不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D BEV特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OcRFDet通过结合OcRF和HOA，显著提升了多视角3D物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

Conclusion: EV-UAV数据集和EV-SpSegNet方法为事件相机的小目标检测研究提供了重要工具和基准。

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

Method: 提出StackCLIP模型，包含CSP模块（通过堆叠语义相似类别生成通用提示）和EFA模块（训练知识特定线性层并自适应集成）。此外引入RPL模块优化提示学习。

Result: 在七个工业异常检测数据集上实现零样本异常检测和分割任务的最优性能。

Conclusion: StackCLIP通过堆叠提示和模块化设计显著提升模型泛化能力和性能，适用于工业异常检测任务。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and
generated data are available in

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在处理视觉信息时经常产生与视觉内容不符的幻觉，现有方法依赖昂贵的手动标注和训练成本，或增加推理时间。

Method: 提出Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI)，利用LVLMs对caption queries的注意力激活模式，增强其视觉感知能力，无需额外训练。

Result: 在四个基准测试（涵盖判别和生成任务）中，CAI以最小的额外推理成本实现了SOTA的幻觉缓解性能。

Conclusion: CAI是一种高效且无需训练的幻觉缓解方法，显著提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

Conclusion: 合成数据可以有效弥补真实标注数据的不足，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on
our project website: https://synslidegen.github.io/.

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

Motivation: 现有方法将多视图图像仅视为传递开放词汇信息的中介，忽略了其丰富的语义内容和跨视图对应关系，限制了模型效果。

Method: PGOV3D采用两阶段训练：第一阶段在部分场景预训练，利用多视图RGB-D输入生成密集语义信息；第二阶段在完整场景微调，通过伪标签桥接语义差距。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS基准测试中，PGOV3D表现出色。

Conclusion: PGOV3D通过部分到全局的课程学习和多模态监督，显著提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的效果。

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖于高质量的点云初始化，而在纹理不足或视角受限的场景中，SfM方法会失败，导致重建质量下降。

Method: AttentionGS结合几何注意力和纹理注意力，早期恢复全局结构，后期优化细节，并使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密度化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，AttentionGS显著优于现有方法，尤其是在点云初始化不可靠的场景中。

Conclusion: AttentionGS为3DGS在现实应用中的鲁棒性和灵活性提供了新途径。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法在细节生成方面表现优异，但计算效率低下，难以实用化。

Method: 1. 使用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量；2. 引入分解条件降低学习复杂度；3. 将预训练扩散模型转换为捷径模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR在性能上与现有最佳方法相当，但速度快100倍以上，处理2秒1080p视频仅需7秒，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR通过高效设计解决了扩散模型的计算效率问题，为视频和图像超分辨率提供了实用化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Result: 扩散模型展现出创造性融合能力，但不同方法在不同条件下表现各异。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有显著的组合潜力，但对输入变化敏感。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Conclusion: 通过缩小视觉与文本表示的差距，推动了更高效的多模态基础模型发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: VAP-Diffusion利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的外部知识，通过视觉属性提示生成更真实多样的医学图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述往往不可得。

Method: 设计基于Chain-of-Thoughts的提示从MLLMs获取描述，提出原型条件机制增强生成器鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种数据集的三种医学图像类型上验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过外部知识和原型条件机制提升了医学图像生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Conclusion: MReg通过模仿超声医师逻辑和增强特征表示，显著提升了MR诊断的准确性和临床适用性。

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决现有数据剪枝方法因依赖梯度或代理模型而产生的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出Partial Forward Blocking (PFB)，基于浅层特征评估样本重要性并动态剪枝，减少深层前向传播和反向传播的计算开销。

Result: 在ImageNet上，PFB剪枝40%数据时，准确率提升0.5%，训练时间减少33%。

Conclusion: PFB是一种高效的无损训练加速框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: Vision Transformer计算成本高，传统剪枝方法在未见数据域中表现不佳，导致资源分配不优。

Method: 提出P3B方法，通过块级相对贡献全局分配参数资源，保留关键组件。

Result: P3B在高稀疏性（70%参数减少）下仅损失0.64%准确率，表现优异。

Conclusion: P3B是先进的剪枝方法，尤其在迁移学习中表现突出。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了扩散模型在对抗样本生成中的泛化和迁移性问题，适用于更广泛的下游任务。

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合优化语义和视觉表示，有效解决了运动定制中的语义和视觉平衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

Result: 在三个乳腺癌MRI数据集上验证，性能接近监督基准，平均Dice系数提升3.75%。

Conclusion: 方法高效且易集成，适用于临床实时需求，代码已开源。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

Conclusion: Subjective Camera通过创新框架有效解决了现有挑战，实现了高质量的场景重建。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: Proteus-ID为视频身份定制任务提供了高效解决方案，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark

concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

*Yongjian Wu,Yang Zhou,Jiya Saiyin,Bingzheng Wei,Yan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisTex-OVLM是一种通过视觉文本化增强对象级视觉语言模型（OVLM）检测罕见类别能力的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见类别因难以文本描述或预训练数据中缺失而导致的检测困难问题。

Method: 利用多尺度文本化块和多阶段融合策略，将视觉示例信息转化为文本特征空间中的视觉标记。

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准测试（PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上表现优异，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在保持OVLM原有架构和泛化能力的同时，显著提升了少样本场景下的性能。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.
The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.

TL;DR: CRefDiff是一种基于扩散模型的新型可控参考超分辨率方法，通过双分支融合机制和Better Start策略，解决了现有RefSR方法在真实世界遥感图像中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法在真实世界复杂场景（如跨传感器分辨率差异和地表覆盖变化）中表现不佳，导致生成不足或过度依赖参考图像。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，引入双分支融合机制自适应整合参考图像的局部和全局信息，并提出Better Start策略加速推理。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上，CRefDiff在多项指标上达到最优，并提升了场景分类和语义分割等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过可控参考和高效推理，显著提升了遥感图像超分辨率的性能和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

*Carl Olsson,Amanda Nilsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用已知相机标定的方法，通过引入成对相对旋转估计，实现近度量重建，解决了初始化自由BA中仅能生成投影变换解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有初始化自由BA方法使用伪物体空间误差（pOSE）作为替代目标，但其无法利用相机标定信息，导致解仅能确定到投影变换，且需要更多数据。本文旨在利用相机标定信息，实现近度量重建。

Method: 通过引入成对相对旋转估计（仅对相似变换不变），将旋转平均集成到pOSE框架中，实现初始化自由标定SfM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠优化目标，从随机初始解高概率收敛到全局最小值，生成准确的近度量重建。

Conclusion: 本文方法成功利用相机标定信息，实现了近度量重建，为初始化自由标定SfM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Result: 在多种模态上验证，性能优于现有方法，适用于同数据集和跨数据集评估。

Conclusion: 该方法无需合成数据或记忆库，各组件均对性能有贡献，代码已开源。

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本学习中表现优异，但缺乏可解释性。为解决这一问题，需要开发能够对齐局部视觉特征与离散属性的可解释模型。

Method: LaZSL利用最优传输实现局部视觉-语义对齐，无需额外训练即可完成视觉区域与属性的交互。

Result: 实验表明，LaZSL在可解释性、准确性和领域泛化性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LaZSL为可解释零样本学习提供了一种有效方法，兼具性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型处理长视频效率低下且难以泛化，Flash-VStream旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Flash Memory模块，包含低容量上下文记忆和高容量增强记忆，分别聚合长时信息并检索细节。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如EgoSchema、MLVU等）中实现最先进性能和高效推理。

Conclusion: Flash-VStream在长视频理解中表现出色，兼具高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Motivation: 现有方法因忽略空间和分子交互作用，导致预测性能受限，NH2ST旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，PCC指标提升超过20%。

Conclusion: NH2ST通过多模态和空间上下文整合，显著提升了基因表达预测的准确性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索多头注意力机制中不同头之间的协作方式及其对分类任务性能的影响，并推广到大规模多头注意力机制中。

Method: 通过量化单头性能（SHP）矩阵，分析多头注意力机制中头的协作模式，并设计新的视觉Transformer架构。

Result: 发现SHP矩阵由多个单元簇组成，提高了信号噪声比（SNR），从而提升分类准确率，并在延迟和性能上优于CNN。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉Transformer中表现出色，并可扩展到自然语言处理任务，为深度学习提供了新见解。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

Result: 该方法高效可靠，特别适用于跨分辨率的结构分析。

Conclusion: PointSSIM为图像比较提供了一种新的有效工具。

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景重建中物体视角缺失问题，提升下游任务对物体的详细理解和外观建模。

Method: 通过3D生成模型替换退化物体，逐步优化几何和纹理，分两阶段对齐和修正不一致。

Result: 在新型视图合成和几何完成任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAISE能高效恢复缺失视角下的物体细节，同时保持场景一致性。

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

Result: 实验结果表明，现有VQA模型在复杂的RGC视频上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门针对RGC视频的VQA模型，RGCD数据库已公开。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以平衡几何保真度和光度一致性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一框架解决多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过度的问题。

Method: HiNeuS引入：1) SDF引导的射线追踪微分可见性验证；2) 射线对齐几何块的平面共形正则化；3) 基于局部辐射梯度的物理基础Eikonal松弛。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过协同优化实现了几何与外观约束的统一，在表面重建和逆渲染任务中表现出卓越的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

TL;DR: 论文提出Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT)，通过基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示解决Vision-Language Pretrained Models（VLPMs）中的Base-New Tradeoff（BNT）问题。CaPT可作为插件提升现有方法的性能，实验表明其显著优于现有条件提示调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉图像信息（VII）的条件提示调优方法在解决BNT问题时表现不佳，甚至不如随机噪声条件提示。研究发现，基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示是解决BNT问题的关键。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过学习基于TCI的动态提示，快速适应新类别。CaPT可作为插件与现有无条件提示调优方法结合，提升性能。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件提示调优基线的性能，且计算成本极低。结合DePT框架提出的DeCaPT方法，性能优于现有最优条件提示调优方法3.49%。

Conclusion: CaPT通过TCI动态提示有效解决了BNT问题，且具有高效性和通用性，为VLPMs的提示调优提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Puzzles的数据增强策略，通过单张图像或视频片段合成高质量的姿态视频-深度数据，显著提升了3D重建模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视图3D重建方法受限于训练数据的多样性和规模，影响了模型性能。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和真实场景几何，Puzzles策略生成大量高质量训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，Puzzles显著提升了现有3D重建管道的性能，仅用10%的原始数据即可达到与完整数据集相当的精度。

Conclusion: Puzzles是一种高效的数据增强方法，能够在不改变网络架构的情况下提升3D重建模型的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

*Longliang Liu,Miaojie Feng,Junda Cheng,Jijun Xiang,Xuan Zhu,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow提出了一种双分支框架，通过正交视图的低失真特性提升全景光流估计性能，特别是在极地区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于透视的光流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真（尤其在极地区域）性能下降。

Method: 提出DCCL操作符联合检索原始和正交成本体积信息，并设计ODDC模块迭代优化运动特征以减少失真。

Result: PriOr-Flow在公开全景光流数据集上表现优异，兼容多种迭代光流方法。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow为宽视场运动估计设定了新基准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示驱动的视觉语言模型（VLM），结合Grounding DINO和SAM2，用于多器官超声图像分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像分割因解剖变异性、成像协议多样性和标注数据有限而具有挑战性。

Method: 使用18个公共超声数据集，通过LoRA微调Grounding DINO，结合SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在多数数据集上优于现有方法，并在未见数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: VLM在超声图像分析中具有潜力，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究发现，简单的卷积网络（SFCN）在脑影像分析中优于复杂的注意力架构（如Swin Transformer），表现出更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估深度学习模型在不同脑影像队列中对年龄和性别预测的泛化能力，尤其是考虑到年龄和性别是临床神经科学中的关键生物标志物。

Method: 使用三种三维架构（SFCN、DenseNet、Swin Transformer）在四个独立队列（UKB、DLBS、PPMI、IXI）中进行年龄和性别预测。

Result: SFCN在性别分类中表现最佳（AUC 1.00-0.85），年龄预测的MAE为2.66-5.81，且显著优于Swin Transformer。

Conclusion: 简单的卷积网络在脑影像分析中比复杂架构更具优势，尤其是在跨数据集泛化方面。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的多模态跟踪方法在频率和时序领域的关键线索利用不足，导致提示学习不可靠。

Method: 设计了视觉适配器和记忆适配器，前者自适应地将辅助模态的判别性线索传递到主导模态，后者存储全局时序信息并动态更新与检索。

Result: 在RGB-Thermal、RGB-Depth和RGB-Event等多种多模态跟踪任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VMDA通过双适配器机制有效提升了多模态跟踪的鲁棒性和判别性，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Motivation: 解决分类模型为何偏好某一类的挑战，通过对比解释提升模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Result: 高相关性概念生成更简洁的解释，低相关性则更复杂；解释在不同图像增强下表现不一。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更可解释和鲁棒的AI系统提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and
acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.
At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

Motivation: 现有零样本和提示技术难以处理稀缺的科学图像数据，Zenesis旨在降低数据准备门槛，提升科学图像分析的效率。

Method: 开发轻量级多模态适应技术，支持零样本操作，并结合人机协作和启发式时间增强。

Conclusion: Zenesis是科学图像分析的强大工具，特别适用于缺乏高质量标注数据的领域。

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently
occurring images to transform visual reasoning tasks, which explains why such
technologies struggle with valuable yet scarce scientific image sets. In this
work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed
to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop
lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation
on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and
heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded
membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an
average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental

Result: 在多种连续域自适应目标检测任务中验证了方法的有效性，生成的参数能更好地捕捉目标相关信息。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了检测器的泛化能力，避免了局部最优和灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中容易受到认知偏见（如设计固定）的影响，导致设计空间的局部最优。IT-Blender旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练的扩散模型（SD和FLUX）混合干净参考图像和噪声生成图像的潜在表示，并结合新颖的混合注意力机制。

Result: IT-Blender在混合视觉和文本概念方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了图像生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在统一理解和生成方面表现出色，但运动-语言统一模型的发展仍不足。需要解决运动模态与离散表示的差距以及语言智能退化问题。

Method: 采用专家混合方法，MotionGPT3将运动作为第二模态，通过分离参数建模运动，并利用共享注意力机制实现双向信息流。运动分支使用扩散头直接从隐藏状态预测运动潜在表示，绕过离散化。

Result: 实验表明，MotionGPT3在运动理解和生成任务上表现优异，同时保持了强大的语言能力。

Conclusion: MotionGPT3为自回归框架下的双模态运动扩散模型提供了统一解决方案，解决了运动与语言统一建模的核心挑战。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

TL;DR: WaRA是一种新型参数高效微调方法，利用小波变换分解权重更新矩阵，通过多分辨率分析捕捉复杂模式，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉权重更新中的复杂模式。

Method: 提出WaRA，利用小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在频域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重构更新。

Result: WaRA在视觉任务（如图像生成、分类、语义分割）中表现优异，显著提升生成图像质量并降低计算复杂度，且在语言任务中也有效。

Conclusion: WaRA通过多分辨率分析提供更灵活和稀疏的表示，适用于多种任务，具有广泛适用性和通用性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

### [216] [MILo: Mesh-In-the-Loop Gaussian Splatting for Detailed and Efficient Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24096)
*Antoine Guédon,Diego Gomez,Nissim Maruani,Bingchen Gong,George Drettakis,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILo是一种新型高斯泼溅框架，通过可微分地从3D高斯中提取网格，解决了从体积表示到表面表示的转换问题，减少了顶点数量并保留了几何细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通过昂贵的后处理步骤提取表面网格，导致几何细节丢失或生成过于密集的网格，限制了最终网格保留训练中捕获的几何结构的能力。

Method: MILo设计了一种完全可微分的过程，直接从高斯参数中构建网格（包括顶点位置和连接性），并引入了双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取过程和基于3D高斯的符号距离计算方法。

Result: 该方法能够以最先进的质量重建完整场景，包括背景，同时所需的网格顶点数量比之前方法少一个数量级。

Conclusion: MILo生成的网格轻量且内部为空，适用于物理模拟或动画等下游应用。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Motivation: 现有的大多数标题数据集缺乏视觉实体的位置和关系信息，而现有的接地标题数据集又存在描述不详细、关系缺失等问题。

Method: 设计了三阶段标注流程（开放世界感知、详细对象标题生成、密集标题合并）和两个VLM模型（Detailed Region Caption模型和Spatial Caption Merging模型）。

Result: 在多种任务（如视觉语言理解、视觉接地和区域标题生成）上的实验证明了DenseWorld-1M数据集和标注模型的有效性。

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M是一个大规模、详细且接地的标题数据集，填补了现有研究的空白，并通过高效标注流程和模型提升了数据质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视频扩散的世界模型在灵活长度、长时程预测和轨迹规划整合方面存在不足，Epona旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出解耦时空因子化和模块化轨迹视频预测，结合链式前向训练策略减少自回归误差。

Result: 实验结果显示FVD提升7.4%，预测时长显著延长，并在NAVSIM基准测试中优于端到端规划器。

Conclusion: Epona在视频生成和运动规划方面均表现出色，为自动驾驶世界建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Motivation: 当前扩散生成模型在图像、视频和3D内容生成上取得进展，但动态3D内容生成（文本到4D）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用基于面的Jacobian作为可微分网格表示，将4D生成分为静态对象创建和动态运动合成两阶段，并引入灵活性-刚性正则化。

Result: TextMesh4D在时间一致性、结构保真度和视觉真实感上达到最先进水平，且仅需24GB GPU内存。

Conclusion: TextMesh4D为文本驱动的4D网格生成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，代码将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D
generation.

Motivation: 解决数字书法和设计中精确风格控制和数据依赖的挑战。

Method: 1. 自蒸馏机制构建风格基准；2. 局部风格注入框架提取风格特征；3. 上下文生成机制嵌入参考图像。

Result: 在多种字体和设计场景中准确复现风格细节和字形定位，超越传统模型。

Conclusion: Calligrapher自动化生成高质量字体，为数字艺术和品牌设计提供支持。

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Result: 在多个数据集基准测试中表现优异，训练时间和GPU内存使用减少50%，测试准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: FADRM方法在数据集蒸馏任务中实现了效率和性能的双重突破，成为新的最先进技术。

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and
outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4%
and +4.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/Jiacheng8/FADRM.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的隐式神经表示（INR）视频压缩方法RNeRV，通过优化组件设计和引入超网络技术，显著提升了压缩质量和编码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR方法因需逐样本训练网络导致编码速度过慢，限制了实际应用。本文旨在通过组件分析和超网络技术解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了一个库来分析NeRV家族方法的组件，提出了RNeRV配置，并引入超网络预测INR权重以加速编码。

Result: RNeRV在相同训练时间下平均PSNR提升1.27%；超网络技术进一步提升了PSNR和MS-SSIM，同时保持编码速度。

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络技术显著提升了视频INR的压缩质量和编码速度，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自主机器人在公共空间的实际应用效果及用户需求，以优化未来设计。

Method: 在博物馆设置自主对话机器人Andrea，进行为期六天的无偏见结构化访谈，并分析系统日志数据。

Result: 性别表现无显著影响；访客主要需求为展品信息、多语言支持和更快响应；系统日志验证了访谈结果。

Conclusion: 研究为改进自主机器人设计提供了实用建议，未来将优化系统以满足用户需求。

Abstract: The android robot Andrea was set up at a public museum in Germany for six
consecutive days to have conversations with visitors, fully autonomously. No
specific context was given, so visitors could state their opinions regarding
possible use-cases in structured interviews, without any bias. Additionally the
44 interviewees were asked for their general opinions of the robot, their
reasons (not) to interact with it and necessary improvements for future use.
The android's voice and wig were changed between different days of operation to
give varying cues regarding its gender. This did not have a significant impact
on the positive overall perception of the robot. Most visitors want the robot
to provide information about exhibits in the future, while opinions on other
roles, like a receptionist, were both wanted and explicitly not wanted by
different visitors. Speaking more languages (than only English) and faster
response times were the improvements most desired. These findings from the
interviews are in line with an analysis of the system logs, which revealed,
that after chitchat and personal questions, most of the 4436 collected requests
asked for information related to the museum and to converse in a different
language. The valuable insights gained from these real-world interactions are
now used to improve the system to become a useful real-world application.

Conclusion: 该方法未来可应用于机器人学习及人类运动轨迹或脑信号分析。

Abstract: The movements of both animals and robots give rise to streams of
high-dimensional motor and sensory information. Imagine the brain of a newborn
or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed
sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic
functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic
agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual
information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between
proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor
relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor
modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic
interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed
the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding
temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion
primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its
sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method
can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement
trajectories or brain signals.

Result: 在DRAMA数据集上评估，DriveBLIP2在BLEU、ROUGE、CIDEr和SPICE分数上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 目标注意力机制可有效提升视觉语言模型在实时自动驾驶中的可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT
architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for
emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial.
To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared
to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted
attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in
real-time autonomous driving.

Result: 成功制造出多种复杂结构（如碗、金字塔等），并通过有限元模拟验证变形机制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何设计实现低信息刺激下的复杂变形，为自适应设计和规模化制造提供了平台。

Abstract: We present a simple, accessible method for autonomously transforming flat
plastic sheets into intricate three-dimensional structures using only uniform
heating and common tools such as household ovens and scissors. Our approach
combines heat-shrinkable thermoplastics with Kirigami patterns tailored to the
target 3D shape, creating bilayer composites that morph into a wide range of
complex structures, e.g., bowls, pyramids, and even custom ergonomic surfaces
like mouse covers. Critically, the transformation is driven by a
low-information stimulus (uniform heat) yet produces highly intricate shapes
through programmed geometric design. The morphing behavior, confirmed by finite
element simulations, arises from strain mismatch between the contracting
thermoplastic layer and the constraining Kirigami layer. By decoupling material
composition from mechanical response, this method avoids detailed process
control and enables a broad class of self-morphing structures, offering a
versatile platform for adaptive design and scalable manufacturing.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage
and urban office like environments in real-time.

Abstract: Robust and adaptive robotic peg-in-hole assembly under tight tolerances is
critical to various industrial applications. However, it remains an open
challenge due to perceptual and physical uncertainties from contact-rich
interactions that easily exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study
how to leverage contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate
uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings. By examining
the role of compliance under contact constraints, we present a manipulation
system that plans collision-inclusive interactions for the peg to 1)
iteratively identify its task environment to localize the target hole and 2)
exploit environmental contact constraints to refine insertion motions into the
target hole without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution
to peg-in-hole assembly. By conceptualizing the above process as the
composition of funneling in different state spaces, we present a formal
approach to constructing manipulation funnels as an uncertainty-absorbing
paradigm for peg-in-hole assembly. The proposed system effectively generalizes
across diverse peg-in-hole scenarios across varying scales, shapes, and
materials in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiments on a NIST Assembly
Task Board (ATB) and additional challenging scenarios validate its robustness
in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有衣物展开方法忽视了标准化的重要性，而标准化能显著简化后续任务（如折叠、熨烫和打包）。

Method: 采用双臂多基元策略（动态抛掷展开和精准放置对齐），引入因子化奖励函数（覆盖率、关键点距离和IoU）和空间动作掩码优化动作选择。

Conclusion: 标准化显著简化了折叠任务，APS-Net为衣物操作提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a significant challenge for robots due to the complex
dynamics and potential self-occlusion of garments. Most existing methods of
efficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of
flattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like
folding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to
garment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified
framework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic
fling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for
precise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding
involves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's
shape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot
learning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,
which incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and
intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial
action mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by
selecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent
better coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09
percent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that
standardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see

Conclusion: SPI-BoTER方法结合物理可解释性与数据适应性，为工业机器人高精度控制提供了有效解决方案，适用于智能制造中的精密任务。

Abstract: The widespread application of industrial robots in fields such as cutting and
welding has imposed increasingly stringent requirements on the trajectory
accuracy of end-effectors. However, current error compensation methods face
several critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a
lack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data
requirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and
strong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER).
This method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with
a Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A
parameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical
information is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training,
enabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions.
Additionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient
descent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample
dataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split
of 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It
achieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation
of 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\% reduction in error compared to conventional
deep neural network (DNN) methods. Furthermore, the inverse angle compensation
algorithm converges to an accuracy of 0.01 mm within an average of 147
iterations. This study presents a solution that combines physical
interpretability with data adaptability for high-precision control of
industrial robots, offering promising potential for the reliable execution of
precision tasks in intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to reliably execute complex multi-step manipulation
tasks is crucial for their effective deployment in industrial and household
environments. This paper presents a hierarchical planning and control framework
designed to achieve reliable multi-step humanoid manipulation. The proposed
system comprises three layers: (1) a low-level RL-based controller responsible
for tracking whole-body motion targets; (2) a mid-level set of skill policies
trained via imitation learning that produce motion targets for different steps
of a task; and (3) a high-level vision-language planning module that determines
which skills should be executed and also monitors their completion in real-time
using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Experimental validation is
performed on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot executing a non-prehensile
pick-and-place task. Over 40 real-world trials, the hierarchical system
achieved a 72.5% success rate in completing the full manipulation sequence.
These experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical system,
highlighting the benefits of VLM-based skill planning and monitoring for
multi-step manipulation scenarios. See https://vlp-humanoid.github.io/ for

Conclusion: 该方法有望提升自动驾驶车辆在安全关键场景中的能力。

Abstract: Autonomous drifting is a complex and crucial maneuver for safety-critical
scenarios like slippery roads and emergency collision avoidance, requiring
precise motion planning and control. Traditional motion planning methods often
struggle with the high instability and unpredictability of drifting,
particularly when operating at high speeds. Recent learning-based approaches
have attempted to tackle this issue but often rely on expert knowledge or have
limited exploration capabilities. Additionally, they do not effectively address
safety concerns during learning and deployment. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planner for
autonomous drifting. Our approach integrates an RL agent with model-based drift
dynamics to determine desired drift motion states, while incorporating a
Predictive Safety Filter (PSF) that adjusts the agent's actions online to
prevent unsafe states. This ensures safe and efficient learning, and stable
drift operation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through
simulations on a Matlab-Carsim platform, demonstrating significant improvements
in drift performance, reduced tracking errors, and computational efficiency
compared to traditional methods. This strategy promises to extend the
capabilities of autonomous vehicles in safety-critical maneuvers.

Abstract: The problem of multi-robot coverage control becomes significantly challenging
when multiple robots leave the mission space simultaneously to charge their
batteries, disrupting the underlying network topology for communication and
sensing. To address this, we propose a resilient network design and control
approach that allows robots to achieve the desired coverage performance while
satisfying energy constraints and maintaining network connectivity throughout
the mission. We model the combined motion, energy, and network dynamics of the
multirobot systems (MRS) as a hybrid system with three modes, i.e., coverage,
return-to-base, and recharge, respectively. We show that ensuring the energy
constraints can be transformed into designing appropriate guard conditions for
mode transition between each of the three modes. Additionally, we present a
systematic procedure to design, maintain, and reconfigure the underlying
network topology using an energy-aware bearing rigid network design, enhancing
the structural resilience of the MRS even when a subset of robots departs to
charge their batteries. Finally, we validate our proposed method using
numerical simulations.

Abstract: Exploring high-latitude lunar regions presents an extremely challenging
visual environment for robots. The low sunlight elevation angle and minimal
light scattering result in a visual field dominated by a high dynamic range
featuring long, dynamic shadows. Reproducing these conditions on Earth requires
sophisticated simulators and specialized facilities. We introduce a unique
dataset recorded at the LunaLab from the SnT - University of Luxembourg, an
indoor test facility designed to replicate the optical characteristics of
multiple lunar latitudes. Our dataset includes images, inertial measurements,
and wheel odometry data from robots navigating seven distinct trajectories
under multiple illumination scenarios, simulating high-latitude lunar
conditions from dawn to night time with and without the aid of headlights,
resulting in 88 distinct sequences containing a total of 1.3M images. Data was
captured using a stereo RGB-inertial sensor, a monocular monochrome camera, and
for the first time, a novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. We
recorded both static and dynamic image sequences, with robots navigating at
slow (5 cm/s) and fast (50 cm/s) speeds. All data is calibrated, synchronized,
and timestamped, providing a valuable resource for validating perception tasks
from vision-based autonomous navigation to scientific imaging for future lunar
missions targeting high-latitude regions or those intended for robots operating
across perceptually degraded environments. The dataset can be downloaded from

Result: 实验表明SAD-RL能高效实现安全行为，消融研究证实分层策略和场景多样性是关键。

Conclusion: SAD-RL为复杂驾驶任务提供了一种高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly
introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our
experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our
ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential
for achieving these results.

Abstract: The event camera, renowned for its high dynamic range and exceptional
temporal resolution, is recognized as an important sensor for visual odometry.
However, the inherent noise in event streams complicates the selection of
high-quality map points, which critically determine the precision of state
estimation. To address this challenge, we propose Voxel-ESVIO, an event-based
stereo visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes voxel map management,
which efficiently filter out high-quality 3D points. Specifically, our
methodology utilizes voxel-based point selection and voxel-aware point
management to collectively optimize the selection and updating of map points on
a per-voxel basis. These synergistic strategies enable the efficient retrieval
of noise-resilient map points with the highest observation likelihood in
current frames, thereby ensureing the state estimation accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our Voxel-ESVIO
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Learning policies for complex humanoid tasks remains both challenging and
compelling. Inspired by how infants and athletes rely on external support--such
as parental walkers or coach-applied guidance--to acquire skills like walking,
dancing, and performing acrobatic flips, we propose A2CF: Adaptive Assistive
Curriculum Force for humanoid motion learning. A2CF trains a dual-agent system,
in which a dedicated assistive force agent applies state-dependent forces to
guide the robot through difficult initial motions and gradually reduces
assistance as the robot's proficiency improves. Across three
benchmarks--bipedal walking, choreographed dancing, and backflip--A2CF achieves
convergence 30% faster than baseline methods, lowers failure rates by over 40%,
and ultimately produces robust, support-free policies. Real-world experiments
further demonstrate that adaptively applied assistive forces significantly
accelerate the acquisition of complex skills in high-dimensional robotic
control.

Abstract: 3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising
approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying
physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However,
existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics
using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require
time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for
training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point
cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss,
supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material,
multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained
multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials,
trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate
scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene
forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics
learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction
scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world
experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving
superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream

Abstract: Collision-free optimal formation control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
teams is challenging. The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often
rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an
innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple
UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the
need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem
to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This formation
trajectory planning optimal control problem involves a collective performance
index to meet the formation requirements of achieving relative positions and
velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle.
Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure
collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking
problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that
prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns
lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach and
disregards UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The simulation results
for a four-UAV team (re)formation problem confirm the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

Abstract: Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet
challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic
environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive
grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic
dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality,
real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus
on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which
differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a
substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a
comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a
dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive
objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed
annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions,
we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to
align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for
intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution,
DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art
approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods,
providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will
drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and
evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven
simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting
their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent
populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

that simpler models, particularly multivariate polynomials, effectively predict
pressure dynamics with fewer parameters. This research offers a practical
solution for real-time soft robotics applications, balancing model complexity
and computational efficiency. Moreover, the approach may benefit various
techniques that require explicit analytical models.

Abstract: We implement and evaluate different methods for the reconfiguration of a
connected arrangement of tiles into a desired target shape, using a single
active robot that can move along the tile structure. This robot can pick up,
carry, or drop off one tile at a time, but it must maintain a single connected
configuration at all times.
  Becker et al. (CCCG 2025) recently proposed an algorithm that uses histograms
as canonical intermediate configurations, guaranteeing performance within a
constant factor of the optimal solution if the start and target configuration
are well-separated. We implement and evaluate this algorithm, both in a
simulated and practical setting, using an inchworm type robot to compare it
with two existing heuristic algorithms.

Abstract: While we have made significant algorithmic developments to enable autonomous
systems to perform sophisticated tasks, it remains difficult for them to
perform tasks effective and safely. Most existing approaches either fail to
provide any safety assurances or substantially compromise task performance for
safety. In this work, we develop a framework, based on model predictive control
(MPC) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to optimize task performance for
autonomous systems while respecting the safety constraints. Our framework
guarantees recursive feasibility for the MPC controller, and it is scalable to
high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
with two simulation studies using a 4D Dubins Car and a 6 Dof Kuka iiwa
manipulator, and the experiments show that our framework significantly improves
the safety constraints satisfaction of the systems over the baselines.

Abstract: Efficient identification of picking points is critical for automated fruit
harvesting. Avocados present unique challenges owing to their irregular shape,
weight, and less-structured growing environments, which require specific
viewpoints for successful harvesting. We propose a geometry-based,
semantics-aware viewpoint-planning algorithm to address these challenges. The
planning process involves three key steps: viewpoint sampling, evaluation, and
execution. Starting from a partially occluded view, the system first detects
the fruit, then leverages geometric information to constrain the viewpoint
search space to a 1D circle, and uniformly samples four points to balance the
efficiency and exploration. A new picking score metric is introduced to
evaluate the viewpoint suitability and guide the camera to the next-best view.
We validate our method through simulation against two state-of-the-art
algorithms. Results show a 100% success rate in two case studies with
significant occlusions, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of our
approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/lineojcd/GSNBV

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in
the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a
promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater
flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However,
traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker
dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile
robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting
products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM
systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for
preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have
been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often
neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally,
these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small,
intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a
mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while
maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are
used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.

Abstract: Improving automated vehicle software requires driving data rich in valuable
road user interactions. In this paper, we propose a risk-based filtering
approach that helps identify such valuable driving situations from large
datasets. Specifically, we use a probabilistic risk model to detect high-risk
situations. Our method stands out by considering a) first-order situations
(where one vehicle directly influences another and induces risk) and b)
second-order situations (where influence propagates through an intermediary
vehicle). In experiments, we show that our approach effectively selects
valuable driving situations in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Compared to the
two baseline interaction metrics of Kalman difficulty and Tracks-To-Predict
(TTP), our filtering approach identifies complex and complementary situations,
enriching the quality in automated vehicle testing. The risk data is made

Conclusion: MGPRL是一种高效、无需预校准的多机器人定位解决方案。

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot
relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like
cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high
computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint
environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel
distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

Method: 提出基于邻近图的通道检测和自由空间分解方法，快速识别稀疏但信息丰富的通道，并开发采样算法解决PTOPP问题。

Result: PTOPP在配置性、最优性和效率上显著优于现有方法，提供了高效且通用的自由空间优化解决方案。

Conclusion: PTOPP为机器人路径规划提供了一种高效且通用的新方法，适用于更广泛的路径规划问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e.,
passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths'
traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP
is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its
entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As
passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core
idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its
accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection
and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,
enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment
decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with
accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems
compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based
algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are
developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check.
All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and
efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based
methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution
optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It
is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free
space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad
class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.

Abstract: The adoption of mobile robotic platforms in complex environments, such as
agricultural settings, requires these systems to exhibit a flexible yet
effective architecture that integrates perception and control. In such
scenarios, several tasks need to be accomplished simultaneously, ranging from
managing robot limits to performing operational tasks and handling human
inputs. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive control
architecture for achieving complex tasks such as robotized harvesting in
vineyards within the framework of the European project CANOPIES. In detail, a
16-DOF dual-arm mobile robot is employed, controlled via a Hierarchical
Quadratic Programming (HQP) approach capable of handling both equality and
inequality constraints at various priorities to harvest grape bunches selected
by the perception system developed within the project. Furthermore, given the
complexity of the scenario and the uncertainty in the perception system, which
could potentially lead to collisions with the environment, the handling of
interaction forces is necessary. Remarkably, this was achieved using the same
HQP framework. This feature is further leveraged to enable semi-autonomous
operations, allowing a human operator to assist the robotic counterpart in
completing harvesting tasks. Finally, the obtained results are validated
through extensive testing conducted first in a laboratory environment to prove
individual functionalities, then in a real vineyard, encompassing both
autonomous and semi-autonomous grape harvesting operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在高层次机器人任务中表现良好，但缺乏对低层次物理前提（如物体属性、功能性和约束）的验证，影响其可靠性。

Method: 提出PAC Bench基准测试，包含多样化的数据集（30,000+标注，673张真实图像，100个人形视角场景，120个模拟约束场景），用于系统评估VLMs的PAC理解。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在基础物理概念理解上存在显著不足，限制了其在机器人操作中的可靠性。

Conclusion: PAC Bench为VLMs的物理推理能力提供了标准化评估，并指导开发更鲁棒的模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and realistic interactions between automated driving systems
and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban environments requires advanced
testing methodologies. This paper presents a test environment that combines a
Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the
feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and
vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian
localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach
through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations
of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a
commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is
generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and
projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation
technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle
perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP
domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in
movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes
dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are
monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in
HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable
inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for
complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing
approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to
enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.

Conclusion: 多时间尺度分层强化学习方法有效解决了驾驶行为波动和优化问题，提升了驾驶效率与安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

Abstract: Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative
capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task
is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception,
planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately.
Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action
sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies
perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive
control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic
models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily
applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face
elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics,
directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of
accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.

Abstract: Improving data efficiency and generalization in robotic manipulation remains
a core challenge. We propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained
multimodal image-generation model as a world model to guide policy learning. By
exploiting its rich visual-semantic representations and strong generalization
across diverse scenes, the model generates open-ended future state predictions
that inform downstream manipulation. Coupled with zero-shot low-level control
modules, our approach enables general-purpose robotic manipulation without
task-specific training. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
environments demonstrate that our method achieves effective performance across
a wide range of manipulation tasks with no additional data collection or
fine-tuning. Supplementary materials are available on our website:

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了本体感觉偏移问题，提升了模仿学习在机器人任务中的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

Abstract: The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key
component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk
information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory
planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by
current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a
predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent
and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of
objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a
spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction
results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk
analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and
real-time practicability of our approach.

Conclusion: 该系统有望加速结肠镜技能学习，未来可实现个性化教学。

Abstract: New endoscopists require a large volume of expert-proctored colonoscopies to
attain minimal competency. Developing multi-fingered, synchronized control of a
colonoscope requires significant time and exposure to the device. Current
training methods inhibit this development by relying on tool hand-off for
expert demonstrations. There is a need for colonoscopy training tools that
enable in-hand expert guidance in real-time. We present a new concept of a
tandem training system that uses a telemanipulated preceptor colonoscope to
guide novice users as they perform a colonoscopy. This system is capable of
dual-control and can automatically toggle between expert and novice control of
a standard colonoscope's angulation control wheels. Preliminary results from a
user study with novice and expert users show the effectiveness of this device
as a skill acquisition tool. We believe that this device has the potential to
accelerate skill acquisition for colonoscopy and, in the future, enable
individualized instruction and responsive teaching through bidirectional
actuation.

### [265] [Latent Factorization of Tensors with Threshold Distance Weighted Loss for Traffic Data Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22441)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实交通数据常因通信故障或传感器问题不完整或损坏，影响智能交通系统性能。现有潜在张量分解模型（LFT）对异常值敏感，需改进。

Method: 提出TDWLFT模型，采用阈值距离加权损失函数，为不同样本分配差异化权重，减少异常值影响。

Result: 在两个不同城市环境的交通速度数据集上，TDWLFT模型在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TDWLFT模型显著提升了时空交通数据补全的鲁棒性和效率，为智能交通系统提供了更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and
high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance.
Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as
communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or
corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of
ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,
the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted
and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the
standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to
the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of
Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the
model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to
individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed
datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed
TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RL-Net展示了神经符号模型在手势识别中的实际可行性，为可解释AI在边缘传感系统中的应用提供了见解。

Abstract: Rule-based models offer interpretability but struggle with complex data,
while deep neural networks excel in performance yet lack transparency. This
work investigates a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network named RL-Net
that learns interpretable rule lists through neural optimization, applied for
the first time to radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). We benchmark
RL-Net against a fully transparent rule-based system (MIRA) and an explainable
black-box model (XentricAI), evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and user
adaptability via transfer learning. Our results show that RL-Net achieves a
favorable trade-off, maintaining strong performance (93.03% F1) while
significantly reducing rule complexity. We identify optimization challenges
specific to rule pruning and hierarchy bias and propose stability-enhancing
modifications. Compared to MIRA and XentricAI, RL-Net emerges as a practical
middle ground between transparency and performance. This study highlights the
real-world feasibility of neuro-symbolic models for interpretable HGR and
offers insights for extending explainable AI to edge-deployable sensing
systems.

Conclusion: 研究目标是通过整合人类专业知识与主动学习，改善SARS-CoV-2患者的护理和决策。

Abstract: The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC,
pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate
identification of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection,
is essential for effective patient management and resource allocation. However,
traditional models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced

with active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and
enable progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The
ultimate goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络物理系统（CPS）在多个关键领域至关重要，但其日益增长的连接性使其易受复杂网络威胁攻击，传统安全方法效果有限。

Method: HAMARL采用分层结构，包括专注于子系统安全的本地智能体和全局协调器，并结合对抗训练循环以模拟和预测威胁。

Result: 实验表明，HAMARL显著提高了攻击检测准确性、减少了响应时间，并确保了操作连续性。

Conclusion: 结合分层多智能体协调和对抗感知训练，可有效提升下一代CPS的弹性和安全性。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various
sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous
transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them
highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day
attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion
detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To
overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical
Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.
HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to
subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes
comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework
incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate
evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive
experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed
indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent
reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection
accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The
results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent
coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and
security of next-generation CPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态融合中存在简单策略、高计算需求和缺乏可解释性等问题，限制了临床应用的潜力。

Method: EAGLE采用动态跨模态注意力机制、大规模降维、三种互补归因方法和统一管道，实现了高效且可解释的多模态融合。

Result: 在911名患者中验证，EAGLE能识别高风险和低风险群体，生存差异显著（4-5倍），并提供了临床可解释的特征贡献分析。

Conclusion: EAGLE结合高性能和可解释性，为多模态生存预测提供了可扩展的解决方案，增强了临床信任。

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data
modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical
parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer
from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack
of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE
(Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning
framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal
fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key
innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn
hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality
reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three
complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and
(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We
evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:
glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,
n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis
showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,
while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk
stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to
5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment
intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical
interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and
practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal
survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust
in automated predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球气候模型（GCMs）分辨率低，区域气候模型（RCMs）计算成本高且灵活性有限，现有深度学习方法多为单变量模型，缺乏跨变量交互。

Method: 采用共享编码器和变量特定解码器的ViT架构，联合预测温度、风速和500 hPa位势高度。

Result: 多变量方法实现了跨变量知识转移，性能优于单变量基线，并提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多变量建模在高分辨率气候降尺度中具有有效性。

Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate
dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in
regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic
downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited
flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven
alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that
downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual
awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our
study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and
variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts
three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),
and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,
emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable
approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently
outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while
also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate
downscaling.

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph
Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by
representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models
typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training
separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and
reuse.
  In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining
approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that
aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level,
link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic
heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective
pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient
sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our
preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the
pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the
promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations
for relational data.

Conclusion: 研究为利用策略初始化作为设计工具来理解早期训练中的探索行为建立了理论和实验框架。

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In
this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly
shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from
untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks
and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated
actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss
the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard
architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling
exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for
using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior
in early training.

Result: MIO解决了DPO的后期性能下降问题，在推理和数学任务中表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: MIO为LLM对齐提供了更优的解决方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently
garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical
yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both
RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)
maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within
this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform
contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from
the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI
(equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may
not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is
already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the
DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual
Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage
decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior
performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

Result: FGSM在ε=4和ε=8的扰动预算下，仅损失少量鲁棒性（0.39%和1.39%），但训练时间减少4倍。

Conclusion: FGSM在对抗性鲁棒性迁移学习中不仅高效，且性能接近PGD，是一种有潜力的替代方法。

Abstract: Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model
training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the
features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new
task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as
adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.
However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial
training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of
magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use
of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve
the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that
FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from
scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with
catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or
$\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for
linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance
across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used
method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%
and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using
$4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a
significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust
transfer learning but also a well-performing one.

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature
domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured.
These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and
optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input
spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical.
A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other
decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical
structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose
activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable
hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining
principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition
of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system
architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such
domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient
modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the
open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are
demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system
design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.

Conclusion: H-VAW-D在非参数领域实现了动态后悔的最优性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic
loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a
discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic
regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to
the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random
feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm,
which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that
learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove
that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of
$O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} +
\sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator
sequence.

Result: 数学推理任务依赖特定层结构，移除这些层会导致准确率大幅下降；非数学任务则无此现象。

Conclusion: 数学推理需要预训练中形成的专用层，而非推理任务则无此需求。

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning
capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement
learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these
improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor
adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base
model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic
layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,
knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise
to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across
all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up
to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no
critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires
specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning
tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that
these critical layers are the same layers where major representational
transformation occurs.

Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems
dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering
applications. To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods
rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in
real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning

Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and
reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared
to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its
performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the
resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant
computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires
discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional
state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic
multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly
from observational data. Our method resolves the state on a coarse mesh while
introducing an auxiliary state to capture the effects of unresolved scales. We
learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a modern forward-solver-free
amortized variational inference method. Our approach draws inspiration from
physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, such as large-eddy simulation in
fluid dynamics, while learning directly from data. We present numerical studies
to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive
accuracy compared to direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at
equivalent resolution.

Result: DistShap在准确性上优于现有方法，并首次支持百万级特征的GNN模型，使用多达128个GPU。

Conclusion: DistShap为大规模GNN解释提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their
predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions
to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example,
classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve
identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel
algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple
GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting,
executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed
least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms
most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to
GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC
Perlmutter supercomputer.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative
personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept
($V^*$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to
dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only
reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V^*$
wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms
such as "a photo of $V^*$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail
to capture the intended concept.
  We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the
learned embedding $V^*$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in
direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained
embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing
problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization
methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in
diverse use cases. Our code is anonymously published at

<details>

Motivation: 传统Transformer的残差流机制在存储和检索信息时存在效率问题，希望通过改进机制提升性能和效率。

Method: 用外积记忆矩阵（Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972）替代Transformer的残差流，构建RMT模型。

Result: RMT在性能上优于传统Transformer，减少了58%的FLOPS、25%的参数和41%的训练token，且在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: RMT通过更高效的残差流扩展和方差传播特性，显著提升了模型性能和效率。

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

Method: 框架使用LLM作为实时公平性评估器，结合RL训练交易代理，通过自适应奖励机制优化公平性。

Conclusion: FairMarket-RL为去中心化能源系统提供了一种可扩展的、公平驱动的自主交易解决方案。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for
decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust
frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel
hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P
microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time
fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:
Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness
scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled
{\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that
replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using
Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,
fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and
consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process
demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer
shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its
language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a
large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its
practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven
solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

Motivation: 研究神经网络损失景观的几何结构对深度学习的泛化和优化具有重要意义，尤其是线性模式连通性（LMC）现象。然而，参数空间中的对称性（如神经元排列）使得功能等效的模型显得不同，限制了现有方法的适用范围。

Result: 该框架首次在独立训练的Vision Transformers和GPT-2模型之间发现了低或零障碍的线性插值路径，揭示了损失景观中更深层次的结构。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对称性分析在理解模型空间几何中的重要性，并为未来研究提供了更广泛的对称性框架。

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central
question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and
optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where
independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths,
despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often
obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations --
which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has
predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such
approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries
exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we
introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes:
permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general
invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and
subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this
generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and
zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision
Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the
loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for
understanding model space geometry.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）部署成本高，现有路由方法因仅生成单一响应而过度依赖昂贵模型，未能充分利用低成本模型的潜力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实数据集上可降低成本达60%，性能下降不到1%。

Conclusion: BEST-Route通过智能路由和多响应采样，实现了成本与性能的高效权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences
dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions
and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are
essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.
while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are
incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios
involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust
Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately
modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is
often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the
suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model
accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2
norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective
low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,
we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor
L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear
L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via
Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully
exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off
parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of
missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on
multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery
scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for
decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its
suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural
network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model
inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the
Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to
backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass.
By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF
can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This
paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's
layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve
model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board
demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in
memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm
that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by
learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of
the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained,
score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable
zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises
a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned
distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given
the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we
apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical
system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally
observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis
on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also
provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that
generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a
coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental
observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery
of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity
measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the
influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新颖的年度移民流动和存量数据集，覆盖230个国家和地区，时间跨度为1990年至今。通过深度循环神经网络结合多种协变量，提供了高精度的移民流动估计，并公开了所有数据和代码。


<details>

Motivation: 现有移民数据缺乏全面性和高时间分辨率，难以满足研究需求。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供更精确的移民流动估计。

Method: 使用深度循环神经网络，结合地理、经济、文化等18种协变量，训练模型以学习移民流动模式。通过集成学习和不确定性传递，提供置信区间。

Result: 模型在未见数据上验证，显著优于传统方法，提高了时间分辨率，并提供了置信区间以指导数据收集。

Conclusion: 该模型和数据为移民研究提供了宝贵资源，公开的代码和数据促进了未来研究的可重复性和扩展性。

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual
migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 43 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

Motivation: 尽管xLSTM在时间序列预测等领域表现出色，但尚未用于异常检测，本文填补了这一空白。

Method: 提出xLSTMAD，包含编码器-解码器架构，分为预测（xLSTMAD-F）和重建（xLSTMAD-R）两种变体，并使用MSE和SoftDTW损失函数。

Result: 在TSB-AD-M基准测试中，xLSTMAD优于23种基线方法，展示了xLSTM在异常检测中的强大能力。

Conclusion: xLSTMAD首次证明了xLSTM在异常检测中的潜力，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive
multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity
needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This
architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless
compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear
memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to
Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM
for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the
first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM
architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder
processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is
devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,
the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the
reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded
counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider
local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We
evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17
real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.
In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23
popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the
powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way
for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML), are emerging as a powerful alternative to classical machine
learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to
various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification,
across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical
imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of
renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in
predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides
an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind
turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN
configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and
varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and
tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs
can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases
marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also
reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive
performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable
insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum
machine learning into their work.

Conclusion: SLE及其自动学习方法在可扩展的BN结构学习中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging,
especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently
proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&D) strategies present a promising approach for
learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning
accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing
structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure
learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further
propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs,
addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned
SLE is then integrated into a D\&D method. Extensive experiments firmly show
the superiority of our method over D\&D methods with single BN structure
learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement
usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore,
our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables
and different network characteristics than those present in the training data
for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of
employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Motivation: 在带宽受限环境中，高效模型分发变得至关重要。

Method: P$^2$U传输低精度模型及其与高精度模型的差异更新，而非原始高精度模型。

Result: 实验表明，P$^2$U在准确性、带宽使用和延迟之间实现了更好的权衡，且激进量化（如4位）在带宽或启动时间优先时仍能保持性能。

Conclusion: P$^2$U是低资源环境下高效模型分发的实用解决方案，适用于联邦学习、边缘计算和物联网部署，并能与现有压缩技术结合使用。

Abstract: Efficient model distribution is becoming increasingly critical in
bandwidth-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this
problem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U
transmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing
the difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted
low precision version. With extensive experiments on various model
architectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a
large model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data
sets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U
consistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and
latency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,
aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising
performance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical
solution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource
settings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments.
Given that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be
implemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification,
quantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.

Conclusion: 该方法在时间序列分析中具有高效性和可扩展性，适用于复杂时空数据的模式发现。

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing
auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and
seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework
from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model
interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm
induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we
reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization
problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a
subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the
search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated
spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying
sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by
developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme
makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision
variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the
MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while
maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the
time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover
both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity
of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly
seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and
precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover
dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea
surface temperature.

Result: 在三个公共多组学数据集上，MAGNET在癌症分类任务中优于现有融合方法。

Conclusion: MAGNET有效解决了多模态数据中的缺失模态问题，性能优越且复杂度可控。

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing
modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients.
Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing
modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with
partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality
patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the
number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET
(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with
partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention
mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their
importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the
number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate
predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal
embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality
missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on
three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world
instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the
state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at

that time series generation based on natural language is possible. The proposed

Motivation: 现有GRPO方法因生成和存储多响应导致内存开销大，限制了硬件受限时的可扩展性。

Method: 提出微采样组、连续采样和长度感知调度器，结合FPTAS和SJF优化内存和吞吐量。

Result: 微采样组减少峰值内存50%以上，Infinite Sampling提升吞吐量25%，保持完整响应和内存效率。

Conclusion: Infinite Sampling在GPU内存受限下实现高效稳定的GRPO训练，支持更大组规模。

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Group Reward Policy
Optimization (GRPO) have proven effective for fine-tuning large language models
(LLMs) with human feedback. However, generating and storing multiple responses
per prompt incurs substantial memory overhead, especially as the sample group
size increases, limiting scalability under constrained hardware.
  We propose Infinite Sampling, a framework that enables efficient and stable
GRPO training by decoupling group size from GPU memory usage. It consists of:
(1) micro sampling groups that decompose large groups into memory-feasible
rounds; (2) continuous sampling that interleaves generation across groups to
improve utilization; and (3) a length-aware scheduler combining
token-conditioned sequence length prediction with a two-stage plan: global
grouping via FPTAS and runtime refill via SJF.
  Experiments show that our Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by
over 50% compared to full-group decoding (e.g., from 21.55 GB to 10.64 GB on
Qwen3-1.7B). Building on this, Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over
25% compared to the naive micro sampling group method, reducing decoding steps
while maintaining full-length completions and memory usage. Our hybrid
scheduling ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups under
realistic GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for
maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be
susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental
disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating
vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical
vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position,
speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized
machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns.
First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture
temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model
processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors.
Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by
offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and
performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746,
and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model
attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly

Abstract: A new anomaly detection method called kernel outlier detection (KOD) is
proposed. It is designed to address challenges of outlier detection in
high-dimensional settings. The aim is to overcome limitations of existing
methods, such as dependence on distributional assumptions or on hyperparameters
that are hard to tune. KOD starts with a kernel transformation, followed by a
projection pursuit approach. Its novelties include a new ensemble of directions
to search over, and a new way to combine results of different direction types.
This provides a flexible and lightweight approach for outlier detection. Our
empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of KOD on three small
datasets with challenging structures, and on four large benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming

promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation,

Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and
storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production,
consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the
energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a
realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through
an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the
Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy
outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust

Motivation: 解决PINNs在求解PDE时精度不足的问题，探究精度限制是否源于PDE的病态性或MLP架构。

Method: 引入BWLer，通过多项式插值建模PDE解，可附加于MLP或完全替代MLP，并利用谱导数和预处理优化训练。

Result: BWLer显著提升精度，在多个PDE基准测试中RMSE改进达30x至1800x，甚至接近机器精度。

Conclusion: BWLer为结合PINNs灵活性和经典谱求解器精度提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still
fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand.
In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the
ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models
the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be
added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely
(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we
take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental
precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even
MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above
float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,
adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable
accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully
characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it
during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five
benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for
convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining
compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an
explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave
problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the
performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson
problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the
flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

Conclusion: 为高效LLMs的构建和部署奠定基础，为研究社区提供资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and
industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant
challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously
improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,
creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we
investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware
training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the
scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that
TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model
parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite
of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained
performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we
propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which
demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,
building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that
accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to
floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of
TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.
Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient
LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏差缓解策略存在可扩展性和泛化性不足的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用特征混合框架，通过交叉验证训练四种分类器，并使用偏差敏感损失函数评估效果。

Result: 平均偏差减少43.35%，均方误差显著降低，性能优于SMOTE过采样。

Conclusion: 特征混合框架高效且无需显式识别偏差属性，未来可应用于实际场景。

Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge
due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing
mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints.
However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability
and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a
feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by
redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To
assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained
using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,
including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a
standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an
average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in
MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,
benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that
feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and
demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias
attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the
computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning
algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for
real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.

Motivation: 研究强化学习策略在内外压力下的鲁棒性，受神经科学中突触可塑性的启发，提出参数分类框架。

Result: 在Mujoco环境中验证了框架，发现反脆弱参数能提升策略在压力下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究为设计鲁棒和反脆弱的强化学习系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by
systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external
stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering
introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while
adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations.
This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust,
or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and
adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these
characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco
continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of
antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress,
demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL
policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future
advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

Result: 该方法使小规模学生模型能够从最强的预训练模型中受益。

Conclusion: 通过互信息感知优化和MLP块重加权，有效提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

Result: 在多个评估场景中表现最佳，推理时间减少30%-50%，CRPS提升3%-12%。

Conclusion: Double-Diffusion为空气质量预测提供了一种高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its
spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty.
Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural
Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through
probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right
balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open
question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion
probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air
quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while
precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air
pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative
approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted
from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks
first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with
other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while
enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score
(CRPS).

Conclusion: 结论表明，现代大型语言模型能够以可测量的准确性近似人类心理概念，为开发更可解释的AI系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities
in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these
models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we
developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and
human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological
questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct
psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models
reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity
analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original
categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved
superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5
(55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%).
We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is
associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in
multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach
to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential
representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can
approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering
insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

Result: 在合成任务和机器人手臂操作任务中，该方法能有效捕捉因果动态变化并泛化到新情境。

Conclusion: 元因果图及其驱动的因果探索代理为解决动态因果机制问题提供了有效框架。

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

Result: Forget-MI在遗忘数据集上的性能显著降低（AUC和F1分数分别下降0.221和0.305），同时测试集性能与原始模型相当，且MIA降低0.202。

Conclusion: Forget-MI在多模态医疗数据遗忘中表现出色，平衡了隐私保护和模型性能。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The
newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows
learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees
under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy
optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making
use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser)
and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian
representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance
as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence
rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we
obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate.
Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in
constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are
observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation
algorithms.

Result: SynCheck显著优于传统方法，性能提升4.3%，而传统方法可能降低13.4%。

Conclusion: SynCheck有效解决合成数据质量问题，提升无线传感任务性能。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to
produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world
datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless
sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the
quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance
gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and
generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data -
affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in
current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task
performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of
awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate
these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data
utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model
training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms
quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance
improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Conclusion: GAMA为生成模型提供了可解释性，支持生物序列设计的验证和优化。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic
design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched
for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require
both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be
trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity
antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where
negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the
lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to
extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this
gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution
method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We
assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize
its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically
relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it
to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model
interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies
without the need for negative training data.

Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding
notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning
community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph
halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a
$2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent
monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this
decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various
learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably,
we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization.
Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and
proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently
learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the
realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature,
and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said
learning problems are NP-hard.

Conclusion: M2oE2通过动态适应外部条件，为负荷预测提供了一种更有效和灵活的方法，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system
reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility.
However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors,
such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their
heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information.
We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to
dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a
meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected
parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external
conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further
integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through
selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant
external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for
External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and
robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial
intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning
scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of
concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy.
However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently
satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of
different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types
of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or
personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model
optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning
for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round.
This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning,
which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic
forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates
previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model
performance and low computing cost.

Result: SGKI不仅能估计缺失像素，还能为所有缺失像素构建同时保证的置信带。

Conclusion: SGKI是一种高效且可靠的方法，适用于图像修复和超分辨率任务。

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的Masked Gated Linear Units (MGLUs)，通过共享权重矩阵和硬件友好的内核实现，显著提升了内存效率和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GLUs由于使用独立的权重矩阵导致内存读取量翻倍，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出MGLUs，包括MoEG架构和FlashMGLU内核，通过共享权重矩阵和优化实现减少内存传输。

Result: 在RTX5090 GPU上，MGLUs比标准GLUs内存效率提升47%，速度提升34%，推理速度最高提升19.7倍。

Conclusion: MGLUs在保持或超越基线模型精度的同时，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

TL;DR: Sub-MoE是一种通过子空间专家合并压缩MoE模型的新框架，解决了参数冲突问题，显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型因参数规模庞大面临内存、存储和部署挑战，现有专家合并方法因参数冲突受限。

Method: 采用自适应专家聚类和子空间专家合并两阶段方法，通过SVD提取共享U矩阵并合并V矩阵。

Result: 在Mixtral等模型上表现优异，专家减少25%|50%时性能保持96%|86%。

Conclusion: Sub-MoE在压缩MoE模型方面优于现有方法，且性能损失小。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive
parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges.
Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by
consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter
conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present
Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key
insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated
expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared
$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$
components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)
Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via
K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)
Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to
derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues
frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert
reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse
experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression
for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek,
and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms
existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains
96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on
Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released at

Motivation: 推理模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但其思考时间不可预测，可能导致用户挫败感。

Result: 提出了为推理过程提供“进度条”的实用方案。

Conclusion: 研究对用户交互和未来研究方向具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as
powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive
tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability,
openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user
experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model
will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can
lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce
increasingly long tasks asynchronously
\citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking
time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss
the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法（BAPE），通过显式建模后验概率参数并直接学习贝叶斯分类器，解决了长尾数据分布中的梯度不平衡问题，并确保了贝叶斯最优决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习算法通常通过隐式估计后验概率（如最小化Softmax交叉熵损失）来求解最优分类器，但在长尾数据分布中会导致梯度不平衡问题，无法确保贝叶斯最优决策规则。

Method: BAPE方法显式建模后验概率参数，通过点估计直接学习贝叶斯分类器，无需基于梯度下降，并提出了一种分布调整技术以适应任意不平衡的测试数据分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、CIFAR-100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist等数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了深度网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: BAPE方法通过显式建模后验概率参数，有效解决了长尾数据分布中的问题，且其增益与现有学习方法正交。

Abstract: Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal
approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep
learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by
\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by
minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been
proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.
However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real
world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the
Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a
novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of
the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the
posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,
our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based
on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and
ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a
straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This
method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set
to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance
factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional
computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are
orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they
are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the
posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT,
CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks,
despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: 建议研究社区调整方向，确保深度学习现象研究与领域整体目标一致。

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena
has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent
years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket
hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc
hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,
case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,
there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world
applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the
broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles
that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we
suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing
unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more
general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the
research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the
recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in
approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future
research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well
aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of
deep learning.

Conclusion: HDTree为层次谱系分析提供了新工具，能更准确高效地建模细胞分化路径，支持下游生物任务。

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell
differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological
processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that
represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face
limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,
and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing
these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree
branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical
relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based
approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a
hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized
diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves
stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative
capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion
process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both
general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods
in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool
for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient
modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream
biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

Motivation: 随着数据为中心机器学习的兴起，数据估值方法被用于量化数据点对模型性能的贡献，但其在数据市场中的公平补偿应用存在技术及伦理问题。

Method: 通过分析9个表格分类数据集和6种数据估值方法，研究数据预处理、子采样和少数群体数据估值的影响。

Result: 发现数据估值方法易受预处理技术影响，可能加剧类别不平衡，并低估少数群体数据的价值。

Conclusion: 提出DValCards框架以提高数据估值的透明度，减少误用并增强可信度。

Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML),
various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution
of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data
cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the
context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly
compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are
inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices,
resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular
classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1)
common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter
estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase
class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented
group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency
associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data
Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of
DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data
pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training
generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to
electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as
tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding
temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution
trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model
weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a
large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling
zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS
on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing
that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to
those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability
across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation
tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early
warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

Result: BiDD在合成和真实数据中表现一致，优于现有方法，尤其在存在中介变量的场景下。

Conclusion: BiDD是一种有效的因果发现方法，适用于未观测中介变量存在的情况，且在小样本下仍保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a
foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional
assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable
sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based
methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between
variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously
characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of
unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden
mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical
utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)
for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by
unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through
mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel
independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for
each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the
independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic
consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under
hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted
settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与模块化逻辑推理可提升系统可靠性，为复杂领域提供可扩展、可信赖的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of
artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic
orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic
inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical
reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper
investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that
augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging
Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and
explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries
into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common
failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We
demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through
experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and
system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that
combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor,
enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy,
interpretable AI agents across complex domains.

Conclusion: BenchMake为科学数据集提供了高效的基准测试生成工具，支持多种数据类型。

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and
applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The
relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the
uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains,
makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In
this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the
increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a
benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix
factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases
on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data
instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a
testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across
tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are
compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available
benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有非平稳性，这会降低预训练预测模型的性能。现有的测试时适应方法通常更新整个模型，增加了内存和计算成本。

Method: PETSA使用低秩适配器和动态门控调整表示，无需重新训练。通过结合鲁棒项、频域项和块状结构项的特殊损失函数，保持准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，PETSA在各种基准数据集上均表现优异，且参数需求少于基线方法。

Conclusion: PETSA通过高效的参数更新和专用损失函数，显著提升了预测模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the
performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods
typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We
propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test
time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA
uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without
retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we
introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)
a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise
structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of
various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive
or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将用户活动视为孤立事件，忽略了行为序列的依赖性，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 将CERT数据集转化为时间序列，使用Transformer Encoder建模正常行为，通过重构误差作为异常分数，并结合三种无监督异常检测算法（OCSVM、LOF、iForest）。

Result: 在四个测试集上表现优异：96.61%准确率、99.43%召回率、96.38% F1分数、95.00% AUROC，且误报率和漏报率极低。

Conclusion: 序列建模和高级异常检测在内部威胁领域效果显著，UBS-Transformer方法优于传统方法。

Abstract: Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized
status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing
machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby
failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we
propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT
insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep
sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model
benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores.
These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier
detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and
Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets,
including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer
pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61%
accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low
false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and
conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential
user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

Conclusion: TripleAD通过多通道设计和互蒸馏策略，有效提升了图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and
economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses.
Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of
detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the
tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in
suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual
distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It
includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and
mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of
anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation
module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing
issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced
structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information
flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an
attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and
structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual
distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and
collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.

*Haolan Guo,Linwei Tao,Haoyang Luo,Minjing Dong,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMART提出了一种轻量级、数据高效的校准方法，通过基于logit间隙的精确调整，解决了现有校准方法在高偏差或高方差之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在预测准确性上有所提升，但存在系统性过度自信问题，尤其在安全关键场景中风险显著。现有校准方法要么引入高偏差，要么因高维噪声导致高方差。

Method: SMART利用logit间隙（前两个logit的差值）作为去噪标量信号，结合软分箱的ECE目标（SoftECE），实现高效且稳定的参数更新。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构上的评估表明，SMART在参数更少的情况下，实现了最先进的校准性能。

Conclusion: SMART为神经网络预测中的不确定性量化提供了一种高效、稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习常因数据异构和通信限制导致性能下降，需一种新方法解决这些问题。

Method: 结合权重标准化（WS）和分布感知非均匀量化（DANUQ），WS过滤本地更新中的偏差，DANUQ基于统计特性最小化量化误差。

Result: FedWSQ在多种挑战性联邦学习场景中表现优异，显著减少通信开销并保持高模型精度。

Conclusion: FedWSQ为联邦学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了动量方法在深度神经网络中的有效性，提出了一种广义动量方法QHM，并证明了其收敛性。实验表明，增加批量大小而非降低学习率是更有效的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动量方法在深度神经网络（随机非凸优化）中的理论支持不足，QHM作为广义动量方法，旨在更好地理解此类算法。

Method: 研究了小批量QHM在批量大小递增时的收敛性，分析了学习率衰减与批量大小增加的影响。

Result: 证明渐进收敛需要学习率衰减或批量增加；实验显示有限批量增加对训练神经网络有益。

Conclusion: 增加批量大小而非降低学习率是更有效的策略，为动量方法在深度网络中的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex
objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep
neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization
-- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings
remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that
generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand
the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide
both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with
an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence
requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a
decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we
demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without
decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments
show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for
training neural networks.

Result: 证明了多种注意力机制（如基于核和稀疏注意力）的Transformer具有UAP，并扩展了先前的研究结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计具有UAP保证的新型Transformer架构提供了理论基础，并展示了具体示例。

Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type
architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior
results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our
work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP
and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of
architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we
can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a
non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers
with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention
mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or
establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our
framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer
architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific
functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Transition Matching (TM)的新生成范式，统一了扩散/流模型和连续自回归生成，通过分解任务为马尔可夫转移，提供了更灵活的设计空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型的设计空间已较为成熟，改进空间有限；同时，连续自回归模型在统一文本和媒体生成方面表现出潜力。

Method: TM将复杂生成任务分解为简单的马尔可夫转移，支持非确定性概率转移核和任意非连续监督过程。提出了三种变体：DTM、ARTM和FHTM。

Result: DTM在图像质量和文本一致性上达到SOTA，ARTM和FHTM在连续自回归生成中与非因果方法性能相当，FHTM首次在文本到图像任务中超越流方法。

Conclusion: TM为生成模型提供了新的灵活设计方向，并在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media
generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further
improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those
generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for
unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching
(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies
and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM
decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing
for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary
non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design
avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference
Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by
directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image
quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)
Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition
Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that
generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation
quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless
integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the
first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based
methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these
contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and
relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and
hyperparameters.

Method: A2P框架包括异常感知预测（AAF）和合成异常提示（SAP），通过学习和模拟异常关系来提高预测能力。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，A2P优于现有方法，能够有效预测未来异常。

Conclusion: A2P为解决异常预测问题提供了一种有效的新方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important
scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting
specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly
Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time
series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to
provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we
propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of
Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To
enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a
strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of
anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP)
that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to
predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at

Result: 在三个真实水质数据集上的实验表明，该方法在估计精度上显著优于现有最先进的数据填补模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态环境中的水质监测数据提供了一种有效的处理途径。

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental
monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However,
water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of
missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and
communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming
High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are
difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data
features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank
Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing
temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,
and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine
higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional
information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It
provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in
complex dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Transformer模型通过专用计算电路学习模算术，为更高效和可解释的神经网络方法铺平道路。

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet
remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We
train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and
investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing
principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation
patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the
model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance
gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized
accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model
internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting
entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full
performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that
transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational
circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches
to modular exponentiation.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy
measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based
generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this
task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt
pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods
that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data.
While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the
latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System
embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge
methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the
coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields
consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates
robust generalization under system misspecification between training and
deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Conclusion: 新型水印方法在IARs中成功实现放射性，为图像来源追踪和防止未经授权使用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training
spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free
method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters
and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of
hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete
and continuous weights, for deterministic and stochastic spiking networks,
using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the
algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without
requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The
classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient
training methods for deep Bayesian networks.

Abstract: Process discovery algorithms automatically extract process models from event
logs, but high variability often results in complex and hard-to-understand
models. To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process
executions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable
process model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning
traces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process
models. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process
model discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or
probability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to
capture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace
clustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.
Our approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on
directly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows
clustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's
process model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given
stochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales
linearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing
clusters with clearer control-flow patterns. Extensive experiments on public
real-life datasets show that our method outperforms existing alternatives in
representing process behavior and reveals how clustering performance rankings
can shift when stochasticity is considered.

Motivation: 图神经网络的置信度估计与实际预测准确性不一致，限制了其在安全关键场景中的应用。现有方法依赖粗粒度统计或潜在嵌入，忽略了图拓扑的细粒度结构异质性。

Method: 提出WATS框架，利用可调热核图小波特征为节点分配特定温度，无需重新训练模型或访问邻域信息。

Conclusion: WATS通过图小波特征显著提升了图神经网络的校准性能，且计算高效，适用于不同规模和密度的图。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance
on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with
actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in
safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek
to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop
statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,
thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph
topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a
post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on
tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the
scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence
estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring
logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets
with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS
achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared
methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to
42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared
with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,
scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be
released based on publication.

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory
compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods
remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and
inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley
require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based
model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to
their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable,
model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional
influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike
Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution
that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error,
requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for
unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient
online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated
in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking
quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks
show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,
and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings
and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

*Chang Qi,Matteo Forasassi,Thomas Lukasiewicz,Tommaso Salvatori*

Result: 在多个图像分类任务中测试，深层网络（超过七层）的测试准确率显著提升，性能接近反向传播模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，更好地理解松弛阶段对训练深层预测编码网络至关重要，为复杂任务中的应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural
models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process.
Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow
architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds
five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this
degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during
weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in
guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two
novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to
re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation
phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that
reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods
on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large
improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with
performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings
suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to
train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities
for their application in complex tasks.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在线学习数据生成过程的正常行为并动态适应行为变化的异常检测方法，以准确识别异常点模式。

Method: 引入了一种新的随机有限集后验分布类别（Power Discounting Posteriors, PD），通过新颖的预测后验密度函数实现数据系统性变化的适应和异常检测。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量模拟实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效适应数据行为变化并准确检测异常点模式。

Abstract: In this work we introduce a novel adaptive anomaly detection framework
specifically designed for monitoring sequential random finite set (RFS)
observations. Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data
(normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the
expected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this
study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not
only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also
dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point
patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior
distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate
adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of
point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative
and quantitative simulation experiments.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了带有AdaGrad型预处理的随机梯度下降（SGD），提出了统一的收敛分析框架，并证明了AdaGrad和DASGO等方法的收敛速度可以通过Nesterov动量加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SGD与自适应预处理方法的收敛性，特别是AdaGrad型算法，以解释其实际效率。

Method: 开发了统一的收敛分析框架，适用于各向异性或矩阵平滑和噪声假设，并分析了AdaGrad-Norm、AdaGrad、ASGO/One-sided Shampoo等方法。

Result: 证明了AdaGrad和DASGO的收敛速度可以通过Nesterov动量加速，并首次为DASGO提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: AdaGrad型算法可以同时受益于对角预处理和动量，这可能是Adam实际高效的根本原因。

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type
preconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified
convergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or
matrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover
state-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient
methods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In
addition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed
algorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for
the latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and
DASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov
momentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that
AdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal
preconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the
practical efficiency of Adam.

Result: 模型性能优于仅监督基线，并能与其他半监督方法结合进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为半监督学习提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，具有扩展性和兼容性。

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

Result: EFPI能有效识别阵型并分配球员位置，支持不同时间段的分析，且开源实现可用。

Conclusion: EFPI为足球战术分析提供了灵活且稳定的阵型识别工具。

Abstract: Understanding team formations and player positioning is crucial for tactical
analysis in football (soccer). This paper presents a flexible method for
formation recognition and player position assignment in football using
predefined static formation templates and cost minimization from spatiotemporal
tracking data, called EFPI. Our approach employs linear sum assignment to
optimally match players to positions within a set of template formations by
minimizing the total distance between actual player locations and template
positions, subsequently selecting the formation with the lowest assignment
cost. To improve accuracy, we scale actual player positions to match the
dimensions of these formation templates in both width and length. While the
method functions effectively on individual frames, it extends naturally to
larger game segments such as complete periods, possession sequences or specific
intervals (e.g. 10 second intervals, 5 minute intervals etc.). Additionally, we
incorporate an optional stability parameter that prevents unnecessary formation
changes when assignment costs differ only marginally between time segments.
EFPI is available as open-source code through the unravelsports Python package.

Result: SAEs在发现未知概念方面表现优异，适用于多个应用领域。

Conclusion: SAEs在特定场景下具有重要价值，尤其是在发现新概念和跨学科应用中。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a
series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness.
Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

Abstract: Living plants, while contributing to ecological balance and climate
regulation, also function as natural sensors capable of transmitting
information about their internal physiological states and surrounding
conditions. This rich source of data provides potential for applications in
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. With integration into
biohybrid systems, we establish novel channels of physiological signal flow
between living plants and artificial devices. We equipped *Hedera helix* with a
plant-wearable device called PhytoNode to continuously record the plant's
electrophysiological activity. We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor
environment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions.
Over five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and
automated machine learning (AutoML). Our classification models achieve high
performance, reaching macro F1 scores of up to 95 percent in binary tasks.
AutoML approaches outperformed manual tuning, and selecting subsets of
statistical features further improved accuracy. Our biohybrid living system
monitors the electrophysiology of plants in harsh, real-world conditions. This
work advances scalable, self-sustaining, and plant-integrated living biohybrid
systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

Result: 在四个顺序敏感的算术任务中成功筛选出学习友好顺序，并在乘法任务中复现了先前研究中报告的反向数字顺序。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效识别优化学习顺序，为Transformer在复杂任务中的推理提供新思路。

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform
step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of
these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study
addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder
input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn
arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture
of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign
orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space
grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical
approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four
order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a
learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the
multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior
studies.

Conclusion: 强化学习策略在复合材料制造中具有潜力，可优化工艺控制并提高产品性能。

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes
for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites,
particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades.
Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure
the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing
residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural
integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning
(RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising
the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin
inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our
approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially
observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL
approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential
towards improving process control and product quality in composites
manufacturing.

Abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing healthcare
due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this challenge by
transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user
manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study
in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for
communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the
accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available
in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local
populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context).
The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our
open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to
other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed
to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for
prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users --
such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical
equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive
accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic
understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and
multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility
to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering
patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.

Method: ADReFT采用基于Transformer的双头模型（状态监控器和决策适配器），通过监督学习和强化学习分阶段训练，生成自适应修复动作。

Result: 评估结果表明，ADReFT在修复性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADReFT通过结合离线学习和在线修复，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的安全性和适应性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due
to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.
Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the
runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions
enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into
acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based
constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack
generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in
ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently
but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we
propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method
that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed
tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.
Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint
heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving
environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate
adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety
identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse
annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and
others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to
mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat
conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT
using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate
more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation
results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic
simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in
chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and
semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family
of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed,
accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique
3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data
across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We
develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model
capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and
medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of
linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing
speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only ~50M active
parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of
applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model
without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized
models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to
accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to
build increasingly capable AI models.

Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，神经网络的认证鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法因非凸性和全局半定规划（SDP）的可扩展性问题而受限。

Method: 通过环路变换重新参数化网络，提出凸可接受条件，并结合随机子空间线性矩阵不等式（RS-LMI）分解全局约束为层间约束。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和ImageNet上验证，框架在保持竞争力的准确率的同时显著提升了Lipschitz边界和运行时性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络的认证鲁棒性提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Certified robustness is a critical property for deploying neural networks
(NN) in safety-critical applications. A principle approach to achieving such
guarantees is to constrain the global Lipschitz constant of the network.
However, accurate methods for Lipschitz-constrained training often suffer from
non-convex formulations and poor scalability due to reliance on global
semidefinite programs (SDPs). In this letter, we propose a convex training
framework that enforces global Lipschitz constraints via semidefinite
relaxation. By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a
convex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training.
While the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is
limited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized
subspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the
global constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto
low-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training
objective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly
improved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.

TL;DR: LLM-based agents enable universal interoperability, disrupting proprietary platforms by making data exchange cheaper and unavoidable, though it introduces new risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominance of closed, proprietary platforms in the application layer limits data exchange and interoperability, reinforcing monopolistic behaviors.

Method: Proposes using LLM-based agents to automatically translate data formats and interact with human-designed interfaces, enabling seamless data exchange.

Result: Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviors and promotes data portability, but introduces security risks and technical debt.

Conclusion: The ML community should embrace universal interoperability while developing frameworks to mitigate risks, leveraging AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets.

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTA研究存在结果重复、评估指标有限、实验设置不一致和不足分析等问题，阻碍了公平比较和方法改进。

Method: TTA-VLM在统一框架中实现了8种情景TTA和7种在线TTA方法，并在15个数据集上评估，扩展了模型和评估指标。

Result: 实验发现现有TTA方法改进有限，与训练时微调方法协作差，且准确性提升常以模型可信度降低为代价。

Conclusion: TTA-VLM旨在促进更可靠和通用的TTA策略发展，并提供了公平比较和全面评估的平台。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced

comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Conclusion: RandomizedQ在理论和实验上均表现出色，为无模型强化学习提供了高效探索方法。

Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical
performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement
learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free
settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational
intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness
and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant
of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates
sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic
tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where
$S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode
length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a
logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the
optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance
compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and
Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of
node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical
understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on
graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and
provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link
representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$
framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables
formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy
of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future
architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation
protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess
link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in
practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of
distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on
standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry
increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for
training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between
synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor
performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world
scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which
combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.
While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic
evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and
architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study
comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent
architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we
sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to
investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this
paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in
the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and
efficacy.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including
in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties
such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known
to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist
other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can
consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited
prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly
distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.
Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads
to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by
$h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training
dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the
approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our
analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including
transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further
provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and
function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct
comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,
including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by
maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves
comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:
