*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net架构的扩散模型在文本到动作生成任务中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高级特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含双路径锚定：时间域使用轻量级MoCLIP模型提供语义监督，频域使用低频DCT分量提供补充对齐信号，通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别达到0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了语义对齐问题，实现了高效、可扩展的高质量文本到动作生成。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准，包含2720个问题-答案对，专门测试VLMs在密集场景中的基本视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA数据集主要关注全局图像理解，但当前基准可能高估了VLMs的性能。作者认为在密集场景中编码和推理细节对VLMs仍是挑战。

Method: 使用高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个人物、动作和详细背景。手动标注了六个任务类别的问题来全面测试场景理解。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最好的模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题上的总体准确率为69.5%。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型的关键差距，为开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习框架，用于编辑视频中的生理信号（如心率）同时保持视觉保真度，以解决基于摄像头的生理信号估计带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的生理信号估计虽然方便，但面部视频中的生命体征会泄露敏感的个人健康信息，存在严重的隐私风险。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器将输入视频编码到潜在空间，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用可训练的时空层和自适应层归一化进行融合，在解码器中应用特征线性调制以避免生理信号在重建过程中退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现平均心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持视觉质量的同时实现了可控的心率编辑，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，专注于视角转换下的空间推理挑战，包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视角转换需要多种认知能力，如跨视图识别物体、相对位置定位和心理模拟变换，因此需要开发一个能够系统评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准。

Method: 设计包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化的细粒度诊断类别，从单物体简单任务逐步过渡到最复杂的多物体视角转换场景，评估37个最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 评估结果揭示了系统性的弱点：强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和句法重构下表现不一致。人类准确率达到91.2%，人类响应时间与VLM准确率呈强相关性。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解视觉语言模型的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，并突出了它们在物理空间推理能力上的主要差距。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态时空Transformer(MM-STT)框架，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升高分辨率地面沉降预测精度，在EGMS数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ConvLSTM等方法难以建模长程依赖关系，且现有工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行地面沉降预测。

Method: 设计多模态时空Transformer，采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理多模态特征，融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上建立新的SOTA，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法，将长程预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构固有的深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision language models (VLMs) can achieve expert-level accuracy in 3D understanding tasks like metric depth estimation through simple text-based supervised fine-tuning with sparse labels, without needing task-specific architectures or complex losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with 3D understanding from 2D inputs, while expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation but require specialized architectures and losses. This gap motivates exploring whether VLMs can reach expert-level accuracy without architectural or loss modifications.

Method: 采用基于文本的监督微调与稀疏标签，通过视觉提示和内在条件增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题。不需要密集预测头或复杂的回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使VLMs在深度估计准确率上超越了最先进VLMs超过2倍，首次使VLMs与纯视觉模型相媲美。有趣的是，训练后的VLMs自然避免了过度平滑，在边界区域比纯视觉模型有更少的飞点。

Conclusion: VLMs通过简单的文本监督微调即可解锁强大的3D理解能力，无需复杂架构或损失函数。DepthLM的简洁性还使单个VLM能够覆盖超越度量深度的各种3D任务。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化，融合了Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率泛北极海冰制图及其可靠的不确定性量化对海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计了一个具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型来提取特征；提出了贝叶斯扩展来处理模型参数不确定性；在决策级融合三种不同类型的数据。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，相比其他不确定性量化方法，该模型能同时获得高分辨率海冰浓度图和稳健的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 所提出的贝叶斯Transformer方法能够有效解决海冰制图中的关键挑战，实现高精度海冰浓度制图和可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

*Suhala Rabab Saba,Sakib Khan,Minhaj Uddin Ahmad,Jiahe Cao,Mizanur Rahman,Li Zhao,Nathan Huynh,Eren Erman Ozguven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于路边摄像头和LiDAR的多传感器融合框架，使用卡尔曼滤波进行后期融合，在复杂道路环境中实现精确的车辆检测和定位，提高交通安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施感知在复杂道路环境（如施工区）中面临的透视失真、几何复杂、遮挡和成本等实际部署障碍。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发可扩展的车辆检测定位框架，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹能准确匹配真实车辆路径，即使单传感器数据不完整。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波传感器融合能可靠补偿单传感器限制，提供精确鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力，为复杂交通环境中的主动安全措施提供实用部署路径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先观察后推理"的新范式解决MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中的性能不佳问题，强调增强对伪造痕迹的视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，主要原因是视觉编码器专注于语义识别而非低层伪造信号感知，且微调数据与预训练分布不匹配导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，采用"先观察后推理"范式，首先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪迹感知的视觉能力，并构建ExplainFake-Bench评估基准。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在泛化性和可解释性方面具有优越性，能够提供真正可靠的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过增强MLLMs对伪造痕迹的视觉感知能力，基于实际观察进行推理，能够显著提升AI生成图像检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视线追踪技术检测实时视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视线模式来识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的进步，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。由于深度伪造无法模仿人类对话中微妙的非语言视线交流，这为检测提供了机会。

Method: 基于对话中视线模式的研究，选择可解释的特征构建模型，利用攻击者视频流中估计的视线信息来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自制数据集上测试，模型准确率达到82%，这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法。

Conclusion: 视线追踪技术可以有效检测视频会议中的实时深度伪造攻击，为深度伪造检测提供了新的生物特征信息维度。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于火星样本返回任务中6自由度物体姿态估计的新方法，使用定制渲染器和边缘域模板匹配，在计算和内存受限条件下实现鲁棒定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机械臂在严格硬件约束下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的姿态估计问题。

Method: 使用定制渲染器结合新的边缘域模板匹配度量，仅需低精度、无纹理3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限定位中在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素复杂，难以解析自然语言指称（如"右边的黑色汽车"）。

Method: 使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行链式推理以识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升，添加3D空间线索进一步改善了接地性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，以零样本方式应用的VLM和LLM在鲁棒的户外指称接地中具有互补优势。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VISOR++方法，通过优化的视觉输入实现多模态视觉语言模型的行为控制，无需运行时访问模型内部，适用于开放和封闭模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限：系统提示易被用户指令覆盖，激活向量需要运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要开发跨模型通用的行为控制方法。

Method: VISOR++通过生成优化的视觉输入来模拟目标激活模式，实现行为控制。为VLM集合生成通用视觉输入，无需运行时模型访问，仅通过插入图像即可引导模型行为。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B上验证了拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向的有效性。特定模型和联合优化图像均达到与激活向量相当的性能，在未见模型上也能实现行为偏移，且在14,000个MMLU任务上保持99.9%性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，通过视觉输入实现跨模型的行为引导，为安全关键应用中的VLM行为控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自增强框架，通过任意图像对生成竞争性视觉游戏，让模型在类似"谁是卧底"的游戏中自主生成训练数据，实现持续性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习增强视觉语言模型推理能力时对人工标注数据的高度依赖问题，降低训练成本，促进实际部署。

Method: 提出战略自玩框架，让模型在多个角色间进行战略推理和行动；从任意图像生成游戏；引入迭代自玩策略优化算法，交替进行自玩和带可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉中心理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越了其他基于标注的方法，尽管使用的是无标签数据。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了视觉语言模型可以通过游戏化自玩实现有效的自增强，无需人工标注，在多个领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出一种结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net优势的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉络膜痣有转化为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测至关重要。现有AI诊断方法在眼底图像分割上面临挑战，特别是数据集分辨率低、标注不一致，限制了分割模型的有效性。

Method: 结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，利用两种方法的优势，减少对大规模训练数据的依赖。

Result: 在1024*1024眼底图像上，Dice系数达89.7%，IoU达80.01%，显著优于Attention U-Net的51.3%和34.2%，并在外部数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该混合模型为脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统开发奠定了基础，有望通过自动病灶标注提高诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

Motivation: 现有ViG框架中的节点-邻居特征聚合方法需要针对特定架构进行优化，缺乏能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系的通用聚合方法。

Method: 提出基于交叉注意力的聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自其邻居，并构建AttentionViG架构进行非局部消息传递。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在计算量相当的情况下提供了具有竞争力的准确率。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，需要开发能够从少量样本中学习新类别的方法，同时利用已有类别知识，这更符合广义少样本分类的实际需求。

Method: 构建了包含479,215张胸片的大规模数据集MetaChest，设计了标准少样本分类的元集划分和多标签episode生成算法，评估了迁移学习和ProtoNet扩展方法。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在医学图像少样本多标签分类中表现优异，无需专门为少样本学习设计；数据集规模、类别多样性和高效模型架构对性能有重要影响。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一任务、模态或器官进行训练，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识的方式形成鲜明对比。

Method: 将异构知识源编码为双提示表示：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器进行动态路由。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，K-Prism在语义分割、上下文分割和交互分割设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，能够在不修改架构的情况下灵活切换知识范式并进行跨任务联合训练。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>

Motivation: 人类感知具有主动聚焦特性，需要空间变化的分辨率细节。现有3DGS方法要么输出均匀分辨率导致高计算成本，要么需要密集观测和长时间优化。需要平衡高分辨率整体重建的高成本与用户对局部精细细节的需求

Method: 提出局部高分辨率重建问题，基于低分辨率3DGS重建，通过前馈加密框架融合初始3DGS和多视图图像的多模态信息，设计像素引导的加密机制在大分辨率提升下有效捕获细节

Result: 在局部精细细节重建方面表现优越，对高达1024×1024分辨率的图像具有强可扩展性

Conclusion: GaussianLens方法成功实现了按需局部高分辨率重建，避免了均匀高分辨率重建的高成本和冗余，充分利用了关键区域的高分辨率捕获

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角物体地理定位方法大多基于锚框范式，这种方法的有效性受到预定义锚框的限制。为了消除这种依赖，需要开发无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接预测每个像素到真实框的四个方向偏移量（左、右、上、下）。引入高斯位置编码（GPE）建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，并设计跨视角物体关联模块（CVOAM）关联不同视角下的同一物体及其周围上下文。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，模型轻量且计算高效。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式，结合GPE和CVOAM，以最小的参数开销实现了高效的跨视角物体地理定位，超越了现有的锚框基方法。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有的跨模态检索模型（如CLIP）在处理融合图像-文本模态的检索任务时性能下降，而传统方法需要构建新的三元组数据集，既费时又难以泛化到未见过的模态组合。

Method: 提出GCL损失函数，在mini-batch内对所有模态进行对比学习，利用现有图像-文本对数据集学习统一的表示空间，无需额外数据标注。

Conclusion: GCL是一种有效的多模态检索方法，能够在不增加数据标注负担的情况下提升模型性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中人工检测金属板表面和孔洞缺陷时耗时长、劳动强度大的问题，特别是针对金属板图像数据不足导致的检测精度下降问题。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量金属板图像数据，结合四种YOLO模型版本（v3、v4、v7、v9）进行缺陷检测，最终选择YOLOv9模型集成到SCADA系统中。

Result: YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN数据增强后表现最佳，准确率达到91.3%，检测时间为146ms，优于其他YOLO版本。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN数据增强方法有效解决了金属板缺陷检测问题，建立的AOI系统具有实用价值，且该方法可推广到其他工业制造组件检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像检测和少样本来源识别，构建了包含117万张图像的大型数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成图像检测中因生成模型结构多样性导致的过拟合问题，以及合成图像来源识别因缺乏大规模标注数据集而受限的挑战。

Method: 提出开放集少样本来源识别范式，开发OmniDFA框架进行图像真实性评估和少样本来源识别，构建OmniFake数据集包含45个生成模型的117万张图像。

Result: OmniDFA在开放集来源识别方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA为AI生成图像检测和来源识别提供了有效的解决方案，OmniFake数据集为相关研究提供了丰富的基础资源。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一个主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过三个协同组件解决现有方法在视觉语言推理中的局限性：上下文增强注意力图生成、主动视觉探测和动态注意力转移触发机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但实证分析显示这些方法不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个组件：(1)上下文增强注意力图生成，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡问题；(2)主动视觉探测，基于信息理论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；(3)动态注意力转移触发，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态结构化推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化的多模态推理迈出的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型会记忆训练数据，这主要由早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估驱动，导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹坍缩并加速收敛到记忆图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面很成功，但它们会记忆训练数据，引发严重的隐私和版权问题。现有工作主要关注表征、检测和缓解记忆现象，但记忆发生的根本原因仍未解决。

Method: 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态，研究记忆机制。具体包括分析训练损失、记忆提示对噪声预测的影响，以及分解中间潜在表示。

Result: 发现记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，因为记忆时训练损失反而更大；记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，强制潜在轨迹收敛；中间潜在表示分析显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容取代。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一种多模态医学视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，解决了医学多模态数据多对多映射的问题，在13个医学数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言预训练模型无法直接处理医学多模态数据之间的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计的方法。

Method: 使用概率对比学习，通过InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合模态间分布，引入概率合成采样损失来捕捉模态特定的均值和方差，改善模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于现有Med-VLPMs，并展示了多模态整合的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模方法有效解决了医学多模态数据的多对多映射问题，提高了模态内和模态间的绑定效果，在多种医学任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一个多模态偏好优化框架，通过引入多个语义多样的负样本和Plackett-Luce模型来解决现有方法中单一负样本导致的优化偏差和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过于简化的成对比较，仅通过基本扰动或基于相似性的检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示可解释的语义偏差因子。基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在多模态对齐方面持续优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 语义感知的多负采样在基于偏好的学习中具有有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽略了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 引入轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近性和视觉相似性，使用贪婪加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息量最大的地点邻域。

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上的Recall@1分别为98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%，SPED上仅使用4096D全局描述符就获得100% Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互建模显著提升了视觉地点识别的性能，证明了统一训练框架的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑。它通过离散化地标坐标、统一位置编码和基于视觉语言模型的地标预测，解决了现有方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的多模态人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难。传统方法将结构性地标作为刚性几何约束，当地标与源图像显著偏离时（如大表情或姿态变化、不准确的地标估计）会损害身份信息。

Method: 提出LaTo框架：1）地标标记器直接将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；2）位置映射位置编码整合面部和图像标记进行统一处理；3）地标预测器利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标。

Result: 在超过150K真实人脸对的大规模基准测试中，LaTo在身份保持方面比最先进方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标标记化和统一处理框架，实现了细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and

Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性方法只能输出单一结果，而概率性方法在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。为了解决这个问题，需要建模与2D观测对齐的3D姿态分布。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成以图像观测为条件的3D旋转参数分布，通过transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，并使用小型MLP去噪模型学习每个关节的条件分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够有效预测准确的人体姿态概率分布，解决了准确性与多样性之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型方法能够有效建模人体姿态的概率分布，在保持准确性的同时提供多样化的合理输出。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拖拽式图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；采用无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域；在单次前向传播中实现连贯编辑。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，显示出更高的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过几何引导实现了精确、一致且结构保持的图像编辑，解决了传统2D编辑方法的局限性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be

TL;DR: IPDRecon是一种基于图像平面解码的室内场景重建方法，通过利用单视图内的空间信息而非多视图几何约束，显著提升了在视图数量减少时的重建稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视图像素反投影射线交点作为几何约束，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视图密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时仍能保持近乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅0.24%，性能保持率99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用视图内空间信息为实际应用中视图受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案，显著提升了重建稳定性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了在该领域理解复杂视觉线索的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

### [40] [ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25749)
*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导扩散的虚拟试穿框架，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效消除边界伪影并保持非试穿区域的真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决虚拟试穿中非试穿区域保留的挑战，避免传统后处理策略导致的边界伪影和语义漂移问题。

Method: 采用测量引导扩散框架，结合残差先验初始化缓解训练-推理不匹配，以及无伪影测量引导采样，整合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保持身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性上优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量一致性约束和渐进式求解策略，成功解决了虚拟试穿中的边界伪影问题，实现了高质量的无伪影合成。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [41] [Free Lunch Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Preference Image Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25771)
*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出文本偏好优化（TPO）框架，通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示来实现文本到图像模型的免费对齐，无需配对图像偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖成本高昂的人工标注，存在可扩展性限制，需要一种无需配对图像偏好数据的对齐方法。

Method: 使用大型语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示，并将DPO和KTO算法扩展到该设置中形成TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在人类偏好分数和文本-图像对齐方面均优于原始方法。

Conclusion: TPO框架提供了一种无需配对图像偏好数据的有效对齐方法，具有良好的通用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at
https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了v-HUB视觉幽默理解基准，评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力，发现模型在纯视觉幽默理解上表现不佳，音频的加入能提升理解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力，这对提升人机交互的参与度有实际价值。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含来自经典默片和在线资源的非语言短视频，每个视频配有字幕、描述和解释等丰富标注，支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并构建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在仅基于视觉的幽默理解上都表现困难，从文本评估转向视频评估时性能显著下降。音频的加入有助于视频幽默理解，表明声音信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在纯视觉幽默理解方面存在挑战，整合更丰富的模态（如音频）对复杂视频理解任务具有前景。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

### [43] [PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774)
*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCPO框架来解决文本到图像模型强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，通过比例信用分配机制显著提升收敛速度和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并损害图像质量，主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的反馈不稳定且不成比例。

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定的目标重构和原则性的时间步重加权来强制执行比例信用分配。

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速了收敛速度，提高了图像质量，并缓解了模型崩溃问题，在所有方面都大幅优于现有策略梯度基线方法。

Conclusion: PCPO通过解决信用分配不成比例的问题，为文本到图像模型的强化学习对齐提供了更稳定高效的训练框架。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

### [44] [Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776)
*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ENM Inversion的新反演技术，通过搜索最优噪声图来同时保证内容保留和可编辑性，解决了现有方法在遵循目标文本提示方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本引导图像编辑中面临挑战：反演噪声图虽然能忠实重建源图像，但限制了编辑灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 分析噪声图特性以增强可编辑性，引入可编辑噪声精炼，通过最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异来与期望编辑对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明ENM Inversion在多种图像编辑任务中，在内容保留和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion通过优化噪声图搜索，有效平衡了内容保留和编辑灵活性，为文本引导的图像和视频编辑提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

### [45] [Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models for Image Quality Assessment via Voting and Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25787)
*Wen Wen,Tianwu Zhi,Kanglong Fan,Yang Li,Xinge Peng,Yabin Zhang,Yiting Liao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个自监督框架，通过自我一致性原则让视觉语言模型自主提升图像质量评估能力，无需人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于排名的自我一致性方法，通过多数投票生成伪标签，使用组相对策略优化进行迭代进化。

Result: 在零样本设置下，基础模型的PLCC性能提升了31.8%，在7个IQA基准中的5个上超越了最先进的监督模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了自监督方法在视觉感知任务中的有效性，能够显著提升模型性能且无需人工标注。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

### [46] [EchoingECG: An Electrocardiogram Cross-Modal Model for Echocardiogram Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25791)
*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率学生-教师模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置中优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图（ECG）成本低且易获取，但传统上需要更复杂的超声心动图（ECHO）来评估心脏功能。研究旨在利用ECG预测ECHO的关键结果，使ECG成为更易获取的心脏功能评估方法。

Method: 提出EchoingECG模型，集成概率跨模态嵌入（PCME++）和ECHO-CLIP（基于ECHO-文本对训练的视觉语言预训练模型），通过学生-教师框架将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证表明，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测任务中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计有助于识别ECG中的不确定性区域。

Conclusion: EchoingECG成功地将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，提高了ECG在心脏功能预测中的性能，同时通过不确定性估计增强了模型可解释性。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is
available: https://github.com/mcintoshML/EchoingECG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Point-It-Out (PIO)基准测试，通过精确的视觉定位来系统评估视觉语言模型的具身推理能力，包含三个层次评估阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 提出分层评估协议：S1-参考对象定位、S2-任务驱动指向、S3-视觉轨迹预测，数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的实验发现：GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在S3（需要视觉轨迹规划）上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了VLMs在具身推理能力上的局限性，特别是精确视觉定位和轨迹规划方面的不足。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DSGA模块结合LoRA，在极少量数据下高效微调SAM模型，用于农业复杂环境中的小密集目标分割，仅需4.00M可训练参数（原SAM的4.26%），在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型的参数高效微调面临训练数据有限和田间条件复杂的挑战，需要开发在极端数据约束下仍能精确分割小密集对象的方法。

Method: 引入动态相似性图适应（DSGA）模块，通过可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制构建动态相似性图，结合自适应局部特征聚合，并与LoRA集成形成互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，相比基线SAM微调，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，豆荚计数调整R平方达0.8987。

Conclusion: 该适应方法在自动化农业监测应用中具有实际效用，能够在挑战性田间条件下准确分割和计数小密集对象，同时保持模型稳定性和参数效率。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要在通用基准上评估，在智能产品审核等特定领域应用不足，且传统logo识别方法依赖记忆大量品牌表示，在真实场景中不实用。

Method: 将logo识别重新定义为比较任务，匹配产品图像与候选logo；引入Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Result: 在OOD设置下比强基线高出近10个点，表现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过领域特定的多模态推理范式，能够仅用少量品牌监督实现大规模品牌识别，解决了现有模型过拟合和泛化差的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

*Kazuki Matsuda,Yuiga Wada,Shinnosuke Hirano,Seitaro Otsuki,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VELA自动评估指标和LongCap-Arena基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型生成的长图像描述，解决了现有指标不适用于长描述和推理速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述自动评估指标主要针对短描述设计，不适用于长描述评估；同时基于LLM的评估方法存在推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，采用新颖的LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge框架；构建LongCap-Arena基准，包含7,805张图像、对应的人类参考描述和候选描述，以及32,246个人类判断。

Result: VELA在LongCap-Arena基准上优于现有指标，并实现了超人类性能。

Conclusion: VELA是评估长图像描述的有效自动评估指标，LongCap-Arena为长描述评估提供了专门的基准。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时提升目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励引导方法主要用于图像生成，但在图像编辑任务中应用较少。图像编辑需要在保持源图像内容的同时增强特定目标奖励，这是一个未被充分探索的领域。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，将其建模为轨迹最优控制问题。

Result: 在多种编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间实现了更好的平衡，且避免了奖励黑客问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导的图像编辑提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够在不牺牲图像质量的情况下优化特定目标奖励。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

*Xinyu Tian,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Mengqi He,Fabian Waschkowski,Lukas Wesemann,Peter Tu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VAPO方法解决多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，通过视觉锚定策略优化增强模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现多模态推理存在双重性：虽然能增强逻辑推理能力，但会逐渐损害感知基础，导致基本视觉问题识别失败。这种现象源于视觉遗忘，即长时间推理使模型逐渐忽视视觉输入。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)，一种简单有效的方法，明确引导推理过程朝向视觉锚定的轨迹。基于GRPO框架，通过强化学习优化策略。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在广泛的基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力和视觉感知能力，为视觉语言模型的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态符号逻辑推理基准MuSLR，评估了7个先进VLM的性能，发现它们在该任务上表现不佳（最佳模型GPT-4.1仅46.8%），并提出了LogiCAM框架提升性能14.13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，需要严格的确定性推理来避免严重后果。当前缺乏评估VLM在此类能力上的基准。

Method: 构建了包含1,093个实例的MuSLR基准，涵盖7个领域和35种原子符号逻辑及976种逻辑组合。提出了LogiCAM模块化框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 7个先进VLM在MuSLR上表现均不佳，GPT-4.1最佳仅46.8%。LogiCAM将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。错误分析显示70%失败源于模态间逻辑不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，LogiCAM框架能有效提升性能，模态间逻辑对齐是未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PatchEAD框架，一种无需训练的异常检测方法，专注于视觉补丁处理，兼容多种基础模型，在少样本和零样本场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测依赖基础模型，但现有研究主要关注文本提示调优，视觉处理部分分散且模型特定。本文旨在解决这一局限，提供统一的补丁中心化框架。

Method: 提出PatchEAD框架，包含对齐模块和前景掩码的视觉提示技术，无需训练即可进行异常检测，兼容多种基础模型。

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本场景下性能优于先前工作，即使没有文本特征。分析了骨干网络结构和预训练特性对补丁相似性鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 统一的补丁中心化框架可实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示，为实际视觉检测应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种硬件无关的方法，使用多个摄像头输入为机械LiDAR生成彩色点云，实现360度覆盖，并在低光照条件下通过集成低光图像增强模块保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 融合摄像头和LiDAR数据以增强空间理解，特别是在低光照条件下提高点云彩色化的可靠性。

Method: 使用多摄像头配置，通过初始校准确定相机内参，自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换，无需专用校准目标。在融合前进行色彩校正确保一致性，并集成低光图像增强模块。

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置测试，优化后的软件实现实时性能，在极低光照下仍能可靠地进行彩色化，成功恢复原本无法检测的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、硬件无关的点云彩色化解决方案，在低光照条件下表现出色，简化了设置流程并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

TL;DR: MAPLE是一个用于少样本全切片图像分类的分层提示学习框架，通过整合多尺度视觉语义并在实体和切片级别进行预测，解决了现有方法无法捕捉组织学实体亚型特异性表型变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉对癌症诊断至关重要的组织学实体（如细胞核、腺体）的亚型特异性表型变化。

Method: 利用LLM生成实体级和切片级提示；提出实体引导的交叉注意力模块生成实体级特征；开发跨尺度实体图学习模块丰富实体表示；结合实体级和切片级输出进行最终预测。

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过多尺度属性增强的提示学习，能够有效捕捉组织学实体的细粒度特征，提升少样本全切片图像分类性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: DeepSketcher是一个包含图像-文本交错数据集和自包含模型的综合套件，通过直接在视觉嵌入空间生成"视觉思维"，实现无需外部工具的图像交互推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"图像思维"范式在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面仍有很大探索空间，需要推进多模态推理的发展。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间进行图像-文本交错推理的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复编码生成图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出色，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关的灵活"图像思维"方法，为推进多模态推理提供了有价值的资源和模型设计。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation

mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态多轮对话安全提供了首个系统性解决方案，通过MMDS数据集和LLaVAShield工具有效应对了跨轮次和跨模态的安全挑战。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层次场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 采用混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和双视觉编码器生成富含语义和空间细节的区域标记，通过基于标记的引用系统让LLM能够推理和定位特定视觉区域。

Result: VLM-FO1在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在物体定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色，且不损害基础模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了一个有效灵活的模式，用于构建具有感知能力的视觉语言模型，弥合了高层次推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了训练数据特征对深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律增长，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面更为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络架构和训练范式有所进步，但它们仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究人员希望了解训练数据特征如何影响不同学习范式（监督、自监督、对比学习）下模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36个最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督、自监督和对比学习方法，训练数据集规模从120万到220亿张图像。在六种黑盒攻击类别下评估模型：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格迁移。

Result: 鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律：数据量增加10倍，攻击成功率平均降低约3.2%；模型规模增加10倍，攻击成功率平均降低约13.4%。一些在精选数据集上训练的自监督模型（如DINOv2）表现优于在更大但较少精选数据集上训练的模型。对抗微调改善了结构变化的泛化能力，但对颜色分布的泛化能力没有改善。

Conclusion: 虽然规模化能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。人类评估揭示了人类与机器视觉之间持续存在的差距。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMAD是一个统一的多模态多类别异常检测框架，通过MoE驱动的特征解压缩机制实现自适应解耦重建，在9个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法将模态和类别视为独立因素，导致解决方案碎片化和内存开销过大。基于重建的多类方法使用共享解码路径，难以处理跨域的大变化，导致正常性边界扭曲、域干扰和高误报率。

Method: 提出Mixture-of-Experts驱动的特征解压缩机制，采用"从通用到特定"范式：编码阶段将多模态输入压缩为通用特征，解码阶段通过稀疏门控交叉MoE将通用特征解压缩为模态特定和类别特定形式。设计了分组动态过滤机制和MoE-in-MoE结构，减少75%参数使用。

Result: 在9个异常检测数据集上达到最先进性能，涵盖3个领域、12种模态和66个类别。

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一的框架解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化问题和性能限制，在保持稀疏激活和快速推理的同时显著减少了参数使用。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法，通过校正采样策略改善文本到图像扩散模型中多概念提示的保真度，防止概念缺失或冲突


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念提示（如"猫和狗"）在扩散模型中常见失败情况：概念缺失、模糊或相互冲突，这是由于模型偏向训练中学得较强的单一概念

Method: 引入校正采样策略，避开提示中单一概念过度强调的区域，引导向所有概念平衡共存的"纯粹"联合模式；分析现有多概念引导方案的不稳定权重区域并适应采样

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验显示，相比标准基线和先前组合方法，概念覆盖率、平衡性和鲁棒性均有提升，概念丢失或扭曲减少

Conclusion: 轻量级校正引导能显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SS-ACL框架，无需专家标注即可生成视觉基础医学报告，通过自监督解剖一致性学习实现报告与解剖区域的对齐，在词汇准确性和临床效能方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学报告生成方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，标注成本高且由于病理分布偏差导致泛化性受限。

Method: SS-ACL框架构建层次化解剖图，基于人体解剖的包含结构组织实体，通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，并引入基于解剖一致性的区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Result: 无需专家标注，在词汇准确性上优于最先进方法10%，临床效能提升25%，在零样本视觉基础任务上超过领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL通过自监督解剖一致性学习，无需昂贵标注即可生成准确且视觉基础的医学报告，在多个下游视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法只能单独计算福利指标，且易受水下场景中鲑鱼遮挡、外观相似和运动相似等问题的干扰，需要一种更灵活高效的追踪框架。

Method: 使用姿态估计网络提取鲑鱼及其身体部位的边界框，通过专门模块利用身体部位信息处理水下鲑鱼场景的特定挑战，然后利用高细节的身体部位轨迹计算福利指标。

Conclusion: 提出的追踪框架能有效解决水下鲑鱼场景的追踪难题，为自动化鲑鱼福利监测提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法难以处理稀疏的真实世界扫描且缺乏标注数据，需要解决细粒度3D部件分割的瓶颈。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线创建大规模场景级数据集，提出PinPoint3D交互框架，通过少量用户点点击实现多粒度3D分割。

Result: 在首次点击设置下平均IoU达到55.8%，仅需少量额外点击即可超过71.3% IoU，相比现有最优方法IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更细致和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: 提出了RH-Partial2Global方法，通过结合jackknife conformal prediction和covering design-based sampling，改进视觉上下文学习中的示例选择过程，解决了现有方法在可靠性和覆盖度方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VICL方法基于相似性优先假设选择上下文示例，但该假设缺乏充分理论依据；且Partial2Global依赖随机采样构建全局排序，导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较，影响最终排序质量。

Method: RH-Partial2Global：1）使用jackknife conformal prediction构建可靠的备选集合；2）采用covering design-based sampling确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 大量实验表明，RH-Partial2Global在不同视觉任务中表现出色，性能优于Partial2Global。

Conclusion: 提出的RH-Partial2Global方法通过可靠的备选集构建和全面的采样策略，有效提升了视觉上下文学习中示例选择的性能。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以适应长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值递归机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现3.7倍加速和60%内存使用降低，同时在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在长视频编辑中与自注意力架构的速度差距更加显著，为高效视频编辑提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Motivation: 解决第一人称视角图像中物体分割标注数据稀缺的问题，利用廉价可得的叙述作为弱监督信号。

Method: 提出WISH模型，通过从叙述中提取知识学习合理的手-物体关联，实现无需测试时叙述的手部物体分割。

Conclusion: 叙述监督为手部物体分割提供有效的弱监督方式，WISH模型展示了从自然语言中学习视觉任务的潜力。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了AgenticIQA框架，将视觉语言模型与传统IQA工具动态集成，通过分解为四个子任务来提升图像质量评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应多样化失真、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常独立处理。

Method: AgenticIQA框架包含规划器、执行器和总结器，将IQA分解为失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行四个子任务，通过动态工具调用收集感知证据。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过模块化代理框架有效解决了传统IQA方法的局限性，实现了更准确和可解释的图像质量评估。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（无失真vs失真、小FOVvs大FOV、远场vs近场）进行联合优化，解决异构多视角深度估计问题。

Method: 将2D特征提升到规范3D体积空间，设计异构空间融合模块处理失真感知的体积特征，采用3D高斯表示替代传统体素融合，使用可学习潜在高斯球动态适应局部图像纹理。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声时会在去噪早期引入块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，其中扩散过程由拉普拉斯算子和强度值共同引导，波动部分保持细节和纹理；并将模型扩展到彩色图像处理。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI等指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，对灰度图像和彩色图像都取得了更好的去噪效果。

Conclusion: 提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面比现有模型表现更优，能有效减少伪影并保持图像细节和结构。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种两阶段零样本组合图像检索方法，通过交集驱动的粗检索和基于多模态LLM的细粒度重排序，解决了CLIP方法中特征融合不精确和语义关系解析不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP方法在零样本组合图像检索中的两个核心问题：基于并集的特征融合会携带不相关的背景细节，以及全局余弦相似度无法解析细粒度语义关系。

Method: 两阶段检索框架：1) 粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；2) 重排序阶段使用经过LoRA适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上达到新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理是构建鲁棒且可移植的零样本组合图像检索的通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将地面地理空间数据与遥感基础模型整合对于推进地理空间智能至关重要，但遥感数据与OSM数据在结构、内容和空间粒度上的模态差异使得有效协同极具挑战性。

Method: GeoLink通过多粒度学习信号增强遥感自监督预训练，引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入的高效预训练，并为下游任务生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Result: 实验表明，在预训练中整合OSM数据提升了遥感图像编码器的性能，在下游任务中融合RS和OSM数据提高了模型对复杂地理场景的适应性。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在多模态地理空间数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Conclusion: 提出的分块式范式具有灵活性，能够高效实现高质量视频超分辨率，为预训练视频扩散模型在分块级细节生成方面的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

*Haoran Pei,Yuguang Yang,Kexin Liu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)框架，通过基于Vision Transformers的软因果掩码引导空间变化噪声注入，增强模型对分布外数据的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学图像等真实场景中，分布偏移问题普遍存在，现有方法追求域不变性但可能忽视泛化的因果机制。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成软因果掩码，在输入图像中注入空间变化的高斯噪声——对背景区域施加强扰动，对前景区域施加弱扰动。

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上相比最先进的OOD基线方法获得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 因果扰动作为实现可靠且可解释泛化的工具具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge是一个轻量级方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态来解决CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现良好，但在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于持续的模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致的嵌入空间未校准。

Method: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法可以是闭式解，也可通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和对齐损失来优化投影。

Result: 训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，特别是在低数据场景（1、2和4样本）中表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性（如前景-背景不匹配），通过轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道提升多模态操纵检测的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操纵检测中表现优异，但在处理主体被错误放置到不合理背景的全局场景不一致时表现不佳，需要解决标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假文本-前景对齐问题

Method: 提出分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合

Result: SGS显著提升了HAMMER在全局操纵检测中的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和token级解释能力，且仅需推理阶段计算，计算开销可忽略

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为处理全局场景不一致性提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [81] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增了5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试多模态检测器在全局推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和标题更改），无法处理真实伪造中普遍存在的前景-背景不匹配等全局不一致性问题，这限制了多模态检测器的评估效果。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1和精心设计的提示生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并生成三种类型的标题：字面描述、文本属性和文本分割，形成FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含5000个高质量样本的DGM4+数据集，通过质量控制管道确保样本质量，包括可见人脸数量控制、感知哈希去重、基于OCR的文本清理和真实标题长度控制。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集填补了全局操作检测的空白，为多模态模型（如HAMMER）提供了更全面的评估基准，有助于提升检测器在全局推理方面的能力。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性，传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但希望避免数据增强并构建更可持续的算法。

Method: 基于主纤维丛截面的几何框架，通过定义对象空间的简单度量来测量对称群作用下轨道之间的差异，并优化截面以最大化类别分离。在对象轮廓数据集上应用了平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化等对称群。

Result: 提出了一个包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数曲线规范参数化族，该方法能够有效处理对称性并分离类别。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的几何框架来处理对称性，具有广泛的应用潜力，代码和教程已开源。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法如新视角合成等存在高计算成本和内存消耗问题，且难以迁移到其他架构

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，并利用时序信息进行标签稠密化

Result: 在OccNeRF模型中mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（提升45%）；EasyOcc模型达到13.86 mIoU；在全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间选择在自监督学习的全面场景理解中具有关键重要性

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从微妙的生物力学线索中预判踢球者意图。

Method: 采用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN提取RGB帧空间特征，LSTM网络处理2D关键点并带有注意力机制，姿态关键点引导视觉关注任务相关区域，基于距离的阈值方法分割输入序列。

Result: 在755个点球事件数据集上，模型在测试集上达到89%准确率，比仅视觉和仅姿态基线高出14-22%。

Conclusion: 轻量级且可解释的设计使其适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析。

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Motivation: 当前文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何和对象变换时存在困难，对复杂指令的遵循能力较弱，需要改进场景合成的准确性和质量。

Method: 使用大型推理模型进行物体检索（涵盖物理、功能和上下文属性），基于隐式和显式布局约束放置物体，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

TL;DR: EVODiff是一种基于信息论的扩散模型推理方法，通过优化条件熵来减少不确定性，在图像生成任务中显著优于现有梯度求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量好，但推理速度慢且存在训练-推理差异。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出数据预测参数化优于噪声预测，优化条件方差可最小化转换和重建误差。基于此开发EVODiff方法，在去噪过程中系统性地优化条件熵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上10次函数评估时重建误差降低45.5%（FID从5.10提升到2.78），在ImageNet-256上减少25%的NFE成本（从20降到15），同时改善文本到图像生成质量并减少伪影。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了理论基础，EVODiff方法通过熵优化显著提升了推理效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型(VAR)的主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略解决现有方法在效率和零样本能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在明显权衡：要么依赖计算昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的架构，但推理速度缓慢。VAR模型以其快速采样速度和强大生成质量而闻名，是解决这一矛盾的理想但尚未充分探索的基础。

Method: EchoGen采用有效的双路径注入策略，将主题的高级语义身份与低级细粒度细节解耦。使用语义编码器提取主题的抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；同时使用内容编码器捕捉复杂的视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真度的纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果证实了设计有效性，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量方面与最先进的基于扩散的方法相当，但采样延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: EchoGen是首个基于VAR模型的前馈主题驱动框架，成功平衡了生成质量与推理效率，为创意AI中的主题驱动生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EntroPE框架，通过条件熵动态检测时间序列中的过渡点来构建动态补丁，解决了传统固定补丁分割破坏时间连续性的问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的时间序列预测方法采用时间无关的固定补丁构造，会破坏时间连续性，分割自然过渡点，削弱短期依赖关系和表示学习效果。

Method: EntroPE包含两个核心模块：基于熵的动态补丁器(EDP)使用信息论准则定位自然时间变化点确定补丁边界，自适应补丁编码器(APE)通过池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面都有提升，验证了熵引导动态补丁方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 熵引导动态补丁为时间序列建模提供了一个有前景的新范式，能够更好地保持时间结构同时保持计算优势。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object

Conclusion: Human-MME基准测试为未来MLLMs研究提供了重要指导，推动模型在人类中心图像理解方面的改进。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

### [91] [Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26166)
*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次对自动驾驶中的行人检测进行全面的姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，发现检测模型对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，且下半身关节遮挡对检测率的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中行人检测的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但公平性这一重要问题尚未得到充分探索。论文旨在系统研究行人姿态变化（腿部状态、肘部状态、身体方向）和关节遮挡如何影响检测性能。

Method: 在ECP-DP数据集上评估5个行人专用检测器和3个通用模型（YOLOv12变体），使用EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现检测模型对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率的负面影响更大。Cascade R-CNN实现了最低的总体漏检率和最小的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在自动驾驶行人检测中进行的全面姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了检测模型在特定姿态和遮挡条件下的偏见问题，为改进公平性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于计算机视觉中自动化、细粒度多属性标注的新框架，特别关注细胞显微镜领域。该框架使用双模型架构，结合CNN进行细胞类型分类和Vision Transformer进行多属性分类，在WBCAtt数据集上达到94.62%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类研究较少。传统的人工标注方法耗时耗力，需要自动化解决方案来扩展多属性标签。

Method: 使用两个互补数据集：PBC数据集（8种细胞类型）和WBCAtt数据集（11种形态属性）。提出双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类。

Result: 在WBCAtt数据集上实现了94.62%的多属性分类准确率，显著提升了模型可解释性，相比传统人工标注节省了大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个新范式，可以扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务，有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Conclusion: TSalV360方法在360度视频中成功实现了文本驱动的显著性检测，为个性化视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GSDD方法，使用2D高斯函数的稀疏表示进行数据集蒸馏，相比传统密集像素方法更高效且可扩展


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法使用密集像素级表示，存在冗余且难以扩展，需要更高效的表示方法

Method: 基于2D高斯原语的稀疏表示，使用少量高斯基元编码关键判别信息，采用CUDA-based splatting算子实现并行推理和训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，同时保持高效的编解码成本

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Motivation: 研究可解释AI中最受关注的特征之一——解释的合理性，即解释与人类推理和期望的一致性。

Method: 扩展现有的多粒度视频摘要解释框架，集成LLaVA-OneVision模型生成文本描述，使用SBERT和SimCSE两种句子嵌入方法量化视觉解释与视频摘要文本描述之间的语义重叠。

Conclusion: 确定了生成视频摘要合理文本解释的最合适方法，并探讨了忠实性与合理性之间的关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度概念专家框架MGCE，用于解决广义类别发现问题。该框架通过动态概念对比学习和多粒度专家协作学习，能够自动挖掘视觉概念并估计未标注数据的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1) 未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，限制了表示质量；2) 大多数方法假设训练期间已知未标注类别的数量，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习(DCCL)在概念挖掘和双级表示学习之间交替进行，联合优化特征学习和类别发现；多粒度专家协作学习(MECL)通过在不同粒度引入额外专家，并使用概念对齐矩阵实现跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上的广泛实验表明，MGCE取得了最先进的结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使没有类别数量的先验知识，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标注数据中的类别数量，适用于实际的开放世界设置，为广义类别发现问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的隐式多模态引导框架，通过识别生成图像与提示之间的不对齐问题，并操纵扩散条件特征来实现重新生成，从而改善多模态对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成图像与输入提示之间的精确对齐问题，现有方法要么依赖有限的高质量偏好数据，要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别不对齐问题，引入隐式对齐器操纵扩散条件特征以减少不对齐，并制定可训练的目标函数——迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的广泛评估表明，IMG优于现有的对齐方法，并能作为即插即用的适配器增强先前基于微调的对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种有效且灵活的多模态对齐解决方案，无需额外数据或编辑操作，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像与提示的对齐质量。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（如Donut）虽然有效但计算成本高，不适合实时或资源受限的应用场景，需要模型压缩方案。

Method: 利用机制可解释性分析模型内部计算，识别关键子组件，通过知识蒸馏训练紧凑学生模型，并进行网络修剪。

Result: 开发出的Donut-MINT在DocVQA基准测试中保持强性能的同时，显著减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实际视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Motivation: 现有潜在动作模型存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的图像编码器空间理解能力差，以及输入帧间隔较大时模型脆弱导致时序感知有限，这阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时序建模；进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界的多个VLA任务上验证，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时序一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Method: 引入推理标注的深度伪造检测数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化(PRPO)强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仿射变换在低比特后训练量化中会恶化结果，因为对所有输出使用统一的仿射参数集无法有效减少量化模型与全精度模型之间的信息差异。

Method: 提出CAT框架，使用聚类特定的参数来精炼低比特量化输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需微调模型或量化参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，该框架在多种架构和低比特设置下始终优于现有PTQ方法，在W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18%的Top-1准确率。作为插件使用时，CAT能将现有PTQ基线提升超过3%。

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的误差减少框架，能够显著提升低比特后训练量化的性能，且具有很好的通用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

*Mehrsa Pourya,Bassam El Rawas,Michael Unser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flower是一个用于逆问题的求解器，利用预训练的流模型生成与观测测量一致的图像重建，通过三步迭代过程实现高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一基于插拔式方法和生成式逆求解器的视角，提供一种能够近似贝叶斯后验采样的通用逆问题求解框架。

Method: 三步迭代过程：(i)流一致目标估计，(ii)将估计目标投影到前向算子定义的可行集，(iii)时间推进步骤将精炼目标重新投影到流轨迹上。

Result: 在各种逆问题上实现了最先进的重建质量，且使用几乎相同的超参数。

Conclusion: Flower成功地将流模型与逆问题求解相结合，提供了理论保证和实际性能的统一框架。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的连续时空视频超分辨率方法，使用3D视频傅里叶场(VFF)表示视频，能够同时捕获空间细节和时间动态，实现任意时空位置的灵活采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频表示为分离的空间和时间组件，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。

Method: 将视频编码为连续、时空相干的3D视频傅里叶场，使用神经网络预测傅里叶基系数，包含高斯点扩散函数确保无混叠重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在广泛的上采样因子范围内提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，证明了连续视频表示的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排序来更好地捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排序阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，在零样本组合图像检索任务中展现了强大性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，用于解决开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题，通过大规模人工偏好数据集训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，并能用于筛选高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源图像编辑模型由于缺乏可靠的奖励模型而发展滞后，无法有效扩展高质量合成训练数据，这成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 构建了\mname奖励模型，使用包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人工标注数据集进行训练，标注由训练有素的专家按照严格协议完成。

Result: \mname在GenAI-Bench、AURORA-Bench、ImagenHub和新的\benchname等基准测试中实现了最先进的人类相关性，优于多种VLM-as-judge模型，并能有效筛选ShareGPT-4o-Image数据集中的高质量子集。

Conclusion: \mname作为奖励模型能够扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，具有强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等高级应用潜力，将公开发布以帮助社区构建更多高质量图像编辑训练数据集。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了任务导向时序定位(ToTG)新问题，并开发了TimeScope框架通过渐进推理在长视频中定位关键时刻，在ToTG Bench基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别长视频中的关键时刻对于下游理解和推理任务至关重要，传统方法在泛化性和处理长视频方面存在局限。

Method: TimeScope框架采用渐进推理：首先在长视频中识别可能包含关键时刻的粗粒度时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼这个范围。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下始终优于现有的时序定位方法和流行的MLLMs，突显了其解决这一新挑战性问题的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeScope通过渐进推理有效解决了任务导向时序定位问题，在长视频中准确定位关键时刻方面表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励模型，通过token熵和两级缩放机制显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法依赖频繁部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。需要专门框架解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出ScalingAR框架，利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，包含两个互补缩放级别：配置文件级别（融合内在和条件信号校准置信状态）和策略级别（自适应终止低置信轨迹并动态调度引导强度）。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型性能提升12.5%（GenEval）和15.2%（TIIF-Bench），同时减少62.0%的视觉token消耗，在挑战性场景中缓解26.0%的性能下降。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功将测试时缩放应用于自回归图像生成，通过新颖的熵信号和两级缩放机制，实现了质量提升、效率优化和鲁棒性增强的三重目标。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出PANDA，一种基于MLLMs的智能AI工程师，用于通用视频异常检测，无需训练数据或人工干预即可处理任何场景和异常类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和人工调整，存在高劳动成本和泛化能力有限的问题，因此需要实现无需训练和人工参与的通用异常检测。

Method: 开发了四个关键能力：自适应的场景感知策略规划、目标驱动的启发式推理、工具增强的自我反思、自我改进的记忆链机制，包括场景感知RAG、潜在异常引导提示策略、渐进式反思机制和记忆链机制。

Result: 在多种场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中实现了最先进的性能，无需训练和人工参与，验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA展示了在无需训练和人工干预的情况下实现通用视频异常检测的可行性，为智能异常检测系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionRAG：一种检索增强框架，通过从相关参考视频中提取运动先验来提升图像到视频生成的动态真实性，采用上下文感知运动适应技术，在推理时计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在生成真实运动方面仍面临挑战，因为准确建模运动涉及捕捉物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态，这些难以在多样化场景中泛化。

Method: 提出MotionRAG框架，包含三个关键技术：检索式流水线提取高级运动特征；基于因果Transformer的上下文学习进行运动适应；注意力机制的运动注入适配器将转移的运动特征无缝集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个领域和各种基础模型上都实现了显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，模块化设计支持通过更新检索数据库实现对新领域的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和转移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，通过高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来识别测试图像中模型性能差异，改进传统平均分数评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，也无法捕捉某些模型在困难图像上产生的伪影问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测模型在哪些测试图像上会产生显著的视觉差异，并设计了相应的评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均性能分数相近但视觉结果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 基于图像难度感知的评估方法能够更准确地反映超分辨率模型的真实性能，特别是在视觉质量方面，为模型比较提供了更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架，通过三阶段渐进式网络（CENet、SFNet、RNet）结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba，实现多尺度特征聚合和空间语义建模，有效去除雨纹并保持图像细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在不足，需要解决图像去雨任务中的精细恢复和全局保持问题。

Method: 三阶段渐进框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet使用混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba进行频率融合，RNet通过原始分辨率子网络恢复细粒度结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了与近期去雨方法相竞争的结果，能够学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式多尺度处理和混合域建模，有效提升了图像去雨的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位后训练量化，在保持纹理细节的同时显著降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高，部署困难。现有的8位量化方法效果良好，但扩展到4位时面临挑战，因为更大的步长会放大舍入误差，导致细粒度纹理丢失。

Method: QuaRTZ采用8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，然后通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位(LSB)，从而保护纹理细节。该方法平衡了异常值保留和LSB精度。

Result: 4位QuaRTZ在FLUX.1-schnell上实现了6.98的FID分数，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过理论推导和实证评估证明了其在不同激活分布上的通用性，为扩散模型的高效部署提供了有效的4位量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生产线需要确保每辆车都符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷，这是一个日益复杂的挑战。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度视图，将任务特定视图路由到专门模块：YOLOv8用于零件检测，EfficientNet用于ICE/EV分类，Gemini-1.5 Flash用于吉祥物OCR，YOLOv8-Seg用于划痕和凹陷分割。通过视图感知融合层标准化证据，VIN条件规则引擎将检测特征与预期清单进行比较。

Result: 在混合数据集上，AVI达到93%的验证准确率、86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持每分钟3.3辆车的处理速度，大幅超越单视角或无分割基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个公开报道的将多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测统一在可部署工业汽车环境中的系统。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统3D风格迁移方法需要预计算姿态和逐场景优化的问题，实现无需姿态估计的零样本3D风格迁移。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，包含几何预测路径（使用自注意力保持几何保真度）和风格注入路径（使用全局交叉注意力确保视角一致性），并引入基于体素的3D风格损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，具有良好的泛化能力，支持从单视角到大规模多视角的设置。

Conclusion: Stylos通过全局风格-内容耦合、3D风格损失和可扩展的框架设计，有效实现了无需姿态估计的3D风格迁移。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如房屋平面图）的逆问题解决方案，使用扩散模型后验采样器，并通过对比学习在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从移动轨迹重建空间布局是一个不适定问题，因为多个平面图可以解释相同的移动轨迹。现有的生成逆求解器在路径规划这一不可逆、不可微的前向算子上面临优化不稳定的挑战。

Method: 采用扩散模型后验采样器，在对比学习训练的嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数，将兼容的平面图和轨迹拉近，不匹配的推远，从而稳定优化过程。

Result: CoGuide模型在实验中比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法产生更一致的平面图，且更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过在嵌入空间中定义代理似然分数，可以有效引导去噪过程趋向后验分布，解决了路径规划前向算子带来的优化不稳定问题。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下展现出强泛化能力，并在多种任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为在昇腾边缘设备上开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Motivation: 现有深度补全方法假设理想的dToF输入和完美的dToF-RGB对齐，忽略了现实世界中的校准误差和异常，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 1) 基于合成数据生成真实训练样本；2) 无学习参数异常检测机制；3) 针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，结合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能：ZJU-L5数据集RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU数据集镜面区域提升37%；Hammer数据集使用低成本dToF数据超越高端设备22%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性和精度，使低成本传感器能够超越高端设备性能，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和要求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含76个控制节点的四个分层分类体系，开发了自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注）。

Result: 当前最强模型在Events和Camera相关控制方面存在显著差距，训练了优于现有零样本基线的自动评估器。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类体系和结构化评估流程指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Motivation: 电子显微镜连接组学中的人工校对成本是当前瓶颈，阻碍了大规模连接组重建和比较连接组学的发展

Method: 利用已有的人工标注数据训练机器学习模型，用于自动化校对工作流程和合并分割片段

Result: 在果蝇中枢神经系统重建中，实现了90%的校对价值，同时减少80%成本；自动合并了20万个片段，相当于4年人工工作量，连接完成率提高1.3%

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效自动化连接组学中的校对工作，大幅降低人工成本并提高效率

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊程度对已拍摄图像进行灵活重新对焦，解决了传统景深效果固定且难以修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦创建就难以修改，当主体失焦时会产生问题。需要一种能够灵活调整图像对焦点和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 设计了基于扩散变换器的重新对焦学习框架，使用模拟数据生成大规模图像对，并提出了堆叠约束训练方法，通过物理原理增强模型训练。

Result: 实验表明DiffCamera能够在各种场景下实现稳定的重新对焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过创新的扩散变换器框架和堆叠约束训练，成功实现了对已拍摄图像的灵活重新对焦，解决了传统景深效果固定的局限性。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制，无法针对特定对象生成声音，限制了在专业拟音工作流程中的应用

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，使用视觉分割掩码结合视频和文本线索进行声音合成，提出SAGANet多模态生成模型

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控高保真拟音合成设定了新标准

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度的音频生成控制，并提供了Segmented Music Solos基准数据集支持进一步研究

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Motivation: 解决全景深度估计中存在的两个主要挑战：全景数据稀缺导致零样本泛化能力差，以及球面畸变导致传统方法效率低下。

Method: 1) 开发数据增强引擎，从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建约607K全景RGB-深度对；2) 提出SphereViT，利用球面坐标强制全景图像特征的球面几何一致性；3) 构建端到端的全景深度估计器DA²。

Conclusion: DA²通过大规模数据增强和球面几何建模，实现了准确、零样本可泛化且高效的全景深度估计，在性能和效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

TL;DR: HART是一个用于稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中重建出完整的人体网格、对齐的SMPL-X身体网格和高斯溅射表示，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽视宽松衣物和人物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了实际场景应用。HART旨在克服这些限制，实现真实场景下的鲁棒人体重建。

Method: HART预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建来恢复完整几何，并与参数化SMPL-X身体模型对齐，最后用人体对齐网格初始化高斯溅射进行稀疏视角渲染。

Result: 在仅使用2.3K合成扫描数据训练的情况下，HART在多个数据集上取得显著改进：衣着网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈变换器可以作为真实世界场景中鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型，HART框架在稀疏视角人体重建方面表现出色，代码和模型将发布。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法假设扫描数据已预对齐到规范坐标系，这导致网络可能利用姿态和尺度线索记忆绝对位置而非推断内在几何结构。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会崩溃。

Method: 引入SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范化特征、在相似不变几何上推理，并恢复原始坐标系。采用去偏评估协议消除隐藏线索。

Result: 在PCN基准测试中优于等变和数据增强基线方法；在KITTI上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D上Chamfer距离降低14%；在更严格协议下仍优于竞争对手的偏置设置。

Conclusion: 完全SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

### [131] [Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641)
*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext是一种新颖的多模态模型方法，通过语义线索和粗粒度图像条件组成的"kontext"桥接VLM和扩散模型，将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力（包括指令理解、定位和图像引用）与高保真合成能力内在纠缠，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出三阶段渐进训练策略：1）通过多模态kontext令牌将VLM连接到轻量级扩散头；2）将头扩展到大型预训练扩散模型；3）引入低级图像编码器进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强统一基线相当，在多个案例中甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功解耦了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了更有效的架构设计。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在捕捉空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）方面存在持续挑战，而早期方法随着架构演进已与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 通过自动生成边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象，然后无缝拼接在一起；利用目标注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上提升了218%，在PosEval上提升了206%；在Qwen-Image上实现了最先进的结果，比先前模型提升了54%。

Conclusion: Stitch成功地将位置控制集成到领先模型中，无需训练即可实现空间准确且视觉吸引人的图像生成，在位置基础生成方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTT3R通过测试时训练视角改进3D重建基础模型，利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率，显著提升长度泛化能力，在全局姿态估计上比基线提升2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中表现出色，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，存在长度泛化限制。

Method: 从测试时训练视角重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计为在线学习问题，利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率来平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，全局姿态估计比基线提升2倍，以20 FPS运行，仅需6 GB GPU内存处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 测试时训练视角为3D重建基础模型提供了有效改进方向，无需额外训练即可显著提升长度泛化性能。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT是一个利用统一建模语言(UML)生成符号思维链和可执行行动计划的结构化推理框架，在杂乱房间清洁场景中优于非结构化思维链方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性有限。现有结构化方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承或行为抽象等构造，也没有顺序或条件规划的标准语义。

Method: 使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练管道，结合监督微调和GRPO策略优化，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化思维链方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在复杂推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

models, whEE identifies key behavioral empathy cues in human interactions. We
evaluate it in human-robot interaction scenarios with our social robot, Haru.
Results show that whEE effectively identifies and responds to empathy cues,
providing valuable insights for designing social robots capable of adaptively

Motivation: 传统方法依赖原始视觉数据（如相机图像）进行轨迹规划存在局限性，需要更高效和准确的视觉表示方法。

Method: 使用多模态传感器数据融合生成BEV特征图，并与高精地图对齐，形成统一的BEV-HD Map格式作为视觉语言模型的输入。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验显示，规划精度提升44.8%，并实现了完全碰撞避免。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型能够有效解释处理过的视觉表示（如BEV特征），扩展了其在轨迹规划中的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV
features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory
planning.

TL;DR: SRMP是一个专为机器人操作设计的运动规划软件框架，能够生成一致可靠的轨迹，是首个支持多机器人操作任务运动规划算法的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动规划框架在高风险应用中难以提供所需的可预测性和可重复性，无法满足工业安全和高质量运动数据集创建的需求。

Method: 开发了SRMP框架，提供Python和C++ API，支持与MuJoCo、Sapien等主要模拟器集成，并包含MoveIt!插件便于硬件部署。

Result: 通过广泛评估，SRMP不仅满足工业和安全性关键应用的严格要求，还在不同机器人系统中为运动规划的一致性设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SRMP填补了现有运动规划工具在可靠性和一致性方面的不足，为机器人操作提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component in any robotic system. Over the
years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been
developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing
frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and
repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring
safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion
datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP
(Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for
robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and
reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning
algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with
major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python
and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate
deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines.
Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only
meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but
also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse
robotic systems. Visit srmp.readthedocs.io for SRMP documentation and

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于视频的奖励建模框架，通过联合预测任务阶段和细粒度进度来自动生成奖励标签，解决了长时程接触式操作中演示质量不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器人学习在处理长时程、接触丰富的操作（如可变形物体处理）时面临演示质量不一致的挑战，奖励建模可以提供稳定的监督信号。

Method: 引入阶段感知的视频奖励建模框架，自动从自然语言子任务注释中推导奖励标签，提出奖励对齐行为克隆(RA-BC)方法过滤高质量数据并重新加权样本。

Result: 奖励模型在验证和真实机器人测试中优于基线方法，RA-BC在折叠T恤任务中达到83%（平整状态）和67%（皱褶状态）的成功率，远超普通行为克隆的8%和0%。

Conclusion: 奖励建模是实现可扩展、注释高效且稳健的长时程操作模仿学习的关键推动因素。

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出P-ACHS算法，一种基于Actor-Critic架构的并行最佳优先搜索方法，用于强化学习推理阶段，通过并行化动作生成和成本估计来提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Actor-Critic模型部署策略过于简单，通常仅依赖直接的动作策略展开，未能充分利用Actor-Critic架构的双网络优势。

Method: 采用并行最佳优先搜索算法，利用Actor网络批量生成动作，Critic网络提供成本估计指导搜索，并在动作生成、成本估计和图扩展三个层面实现并行化。

Result: 在机器人操作任务中验证了方法的有效性，包括无碰撞运动规划和接触丰富的非抓取推动任务。

Conclusion: P-ACHS算法能够有效利用Actor-Critic架构的双网络特性，通过并行化搜索显著提升推理效率，在复杂机器人任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

Conclusion: CoTaP管道能够有效整合合规信息到学习型人形机器人控制结构中，实现可调节的任务空间合规性。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出ESL策略解决多机器人多队列系统的在线任务分配问题，该策略在当前位置非空时进行穷尽服务，空闲时切换到最长未占用的非空位置，并被证明是最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有随机到达和切换延迟的多机器人多队列系统的在线任务分配问题，旨在找到简单实用的实时调度策略。

Method: 提出ESL策略：当前位置非空时进行穷尽服务，空闲时切换到最长未占用的非空位置。同时使用固定驻留循环策略和先到先服务策略作为基线对比。

Result: 在不同服务器-位置比率和负载条件下，ESL策略始终产生更低的折扣持有成本和更小的平均队列长度，行动时间分数显示更多服务和受限的切换。

Conclusion: ESL策略的简单性和鲁棒性使其成为实时多机器人调度系统的实用默认选择。

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content
from a mobile robot platform.

language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

*Amelie Minji Kim,Anqi Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的分层扩散规划器，将任务和运动结构直接嵌入到噪声模型中，使用任务条件化的结构化高斯噪声代替标准的各向同性高斯噪声，在迷宫导航和机器人堆叠任务中表现出更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散规划器使用零均值、各向同性高斯噪声，忽略了任务和运动的结构信息。本文旨在通过将任务结构直接嵌入噪声模型来改进扩散规划的性能。

Method: 提出分层扩散规划器：上层实例化任务条件化的结构化高斯（均值和协方差），下层在该固定先验下对完整轨迹进行去噪。使用高斯过程运动规划（GPMP）推导均值和协方差。

Result: 在Maze2D目标到达和KUKA积木堆叠任务中，相比各向同性基线方法，获得了更高的成功率、更平滑的轨迹和更强的任务对齐。消融研究表明显式结构化噪声过程提供了超越简单条件化神经网络的好处。

Conclusion: 该方法将先验概率质量集中在可行、平滑且语义有意义的轨迹附近，同时保持可处理性，为扩散规划提供了更有效的结构化噪声建模方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: OmniNav是一个统一的机器人导航框架，支持指令目标、物体目标、点目标和前沿探索等多种导航范式，采用快慢模块设计实现高效路径规划，并通过多任务训练提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航模型缺乏统一的解决方案，在不同导航范式中表现不佳，成功率低且泛化能力有限。需要开发一个能够处理多种导航任务的统一框架。

Method: 采用轻量级低延迟策略预测连续空间路径点，使用快慢系统设计：快速模块基于短视野视觉上下文生成路径点，慢速模块进行深思熟虑规划选择子目标和子任务。整合大规模通用训练数据集进行多任务训练。

Result: 在多个导航基准测试中达到最先进性能，支持高达5Hz的控制频率，在真实世界部署中验证了有效性，显著提高了成功率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniNav为具身导航提供了实用见解，为开发多功能、高泛化能力的机器人智能指明了可扩展的发展路径。

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动作分块的PPO强化学习方法，结合行为克隆来解决VLA模型后训练中的稀疏奖励和不稳定问题，在MetaWorld基准测试中取得了93%的成功率和42.17步的平均成功步数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习是视觉-语言-动作模型后训练的有前景方法，但实际部署受到稀疏奖励和不稳定训练的阻碍。

Method: 采用动作分块的PPO方法，结合使用自收集演示的行为克隆。将连续动作聚合成块以提高策略的时间一致性和反馈密度，并使用动态更新的演示缓冲区应用辅助行为克隆损失。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中表现优于监督微调，实现了0.93的高成功率和42.17步的平均成功步数。

Conclusion: 证明了强化学习在VLA后训练中的可行性，为下游VLA应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统灵巧抓取流程和VLA方法在执行阶段存在姿态不准确问题，尤其是在长时程任务中，这影响了整体性能。需要解决这个'最后一英里'挑战。

Method: 设计多分支策略网络，融合多指触觉输入和本体感知来预测精确控制更新。结合MuJoCo中基于物理的触觉模型的大规模模拟数据和物理系统收集的真实数据进行训练。

Result: 比较实验表明，在模拟数据上预训练并用少量真实数据微调显著优于仅使用模拟训练。真实世界实验验证了方法的有效性，仅使用触觉输入实现了毫米级抓取精度。

Conclusion: 这是首个仅通过多指触觉传感实现任意手内姿态调整的方法，解决了抓取执行阶段的姿态精度问题。

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

TL;DR: 提出解耦框架，在仿真中训练控制策略，在部署时适配感知，仅需10-20个真实演示即可实现高效sim-to-real迁移


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端学习中感知与控制纠缠导致的sim-to-real迁移难题，通过解耦降低复杂性

Method: 在仿真中训练控制策略掌握空间布局和操作动态，在真实部署时仅适配感知模块，将复杂问题简化为结构化感知对齐任务

Result: 在桌面操作任务上验证，相比端到端基线具有更优的数据效率和分布外泛化能力，能处理超出训练分布的对象位置和尺度

Conclusion: 解耦感知与控制从根本上改善了sim-to-real迁移效果

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种稳定的流式策略训练方法，通过重新参数化速度网络来解决off-policy强化学习中多步动作采样的梯度不稳定问题，在连续控制和机器人操作任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练表达能力强的流式策略在off-policy强化学习中非常不稳定，这源于多步动作采样过程中的梯度病态问题。作者发现流式展开在代数上等价于残差循环计算，容易像RNN一样出现梯度消失和爆炸问题。

Method: 基于现代序列模型的原理重新参数化速度网络，提出了两种稳定架构：Flow-G（门控速度）和Flow-T（解码速度）。开发了基于SAC的实用算法，通过噪声增强的展开实现直接端到端训练，支持从零开始和离线到在线学习。

Result: 该方法在连续控制和机器人操作基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，消除了对策略蒸馏或替代目标等常见变通方法的需求。

Conclusion: 通过将流式展开重新表述为残差循环计算并应用序列模型稳定技术，成功解决了流式策略训练中的梯度不稳定问题，为强化学习中的流式策略提供了稳定有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法将感知和动作解耦，忽略了人类自然利用的感觉表示与动作执行之间的因果互惠关系，无法实现自适应行为。

Method: 使用变分推理将潜在观察编码为高斯后验，通过动作引导的SDE演化潜在状态，其中扩散策略的噪声预测的VJP作为结构化随机力驱动潜在更新，并引入循环一致对比损失促进感知-动作双向学习。

Result: 在模拟基准和真实UR5机器人操作任务中，DP-AG显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DP-AG为连接生物适应性和人工策略学习提供了有前景的一步。

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

Conclusion: REVER框架成功解决了机器人长时程操作规划的关键挑战，通过可验证奖励和思维链推理实现了物理合理且逻辑连贯的计划生成，显著提升了真实世界任务的成功率。

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon
publication.

Motivation: 柔顺性移动机器人在不确定场景中具有鲁棒性，但由于缺乏刚体假设和形态变化带来的运动学变化，其状态估计具有挑战性。

Method: 使用基于神经网络的状态估计器，结合状态历史记录和直接影响不可靠传感器的机制，在考虑形态相关状态的新型柔顺中心坐标系中训练网络。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效估计柔顺机器人的状态，显著提高了在极端户外地形中的自主操作性能。

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action
model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to
unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具有人工情感表达能力的机器人不断发展，需要研究其说服潜力对儿童行为的影响，特别是机器人表达性如何影响儿童的共情反应。

Method: 对22名7-11岁儿童进行试点研究，使用人形机器人QTRobot在合作轮流游戏中展示不同水平的具身表达（仅身体、仅面部、身体和面部）和两种基本情绪（快乐和悲伤）。

Result: 儿童会调整自己的行为以配合机器人推断的情感状态，但更高的表达水平并未导致更强的行为一致性。

Conclusion: 这些初步结果为思考机器人表达性及其在未来塑造儿童对机器人作为社交同伴的社会情感行为中的作用提供了起点。

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

*Yann de Mont-Marin,Louis Montaut,Jean Ponce,Martial Hebert,Justin Carpentier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了平面Signorini条件，将点接触的Signorini定律与质心压力概念统一起来，建立了离散和连续接触模型之间的桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接机器人学中两个基础原理：防止物体穿透的Signorini定律和用于运动控制的质心压力概念，填补离散与连续接触模型之间的理论空白。

Method: 开发了平面Signorini条件，这是一个锥互补性公式，用于建模刚体间的平面接触。通过几何解释和数学证明，展示了该公式与点接触Signorini定律的等价性。

Result: 证明了该框架自然捕捉了三种物理状态（粘附、分离和倾斜），并提出了扩展质心压力的概念，为平面接触提供了数学一致且计算可行的基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作为接触动力学的精确模拟以及运动控制和操作中高级控制优化算法的设计提供了理论基础，统一了离散和连续接触模型。

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

Motivation: 在物流和仓库场景中，移动机器人经常遇到意外的可移动障碍物，现有的多智能体路径规划和单智能体可移动障碍物路径规划方法无法直接解决这类问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 融合了冲突搜索算法、优先规划方法和PAMO*单智能体规划器，首次尝试将这些方法结合起来解决多智能体可移动障碍物路径规划问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为多智能体可移动障碍物路径规划问题提供了初步解决方案，揭示了不同方法的适用场景和局限性。

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles
(M-PAMO), which seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start
to goal locations among static and movable obstacles. M-PAMO arises in
logistics and warehouses where mobile robots are among unexpected movable
objects. Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path
planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains
under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

TL;DR: EA-CoRL框架结合强化学习和进化策略，实现机器人硬件和控制策略的协同设计，通过设计进化和策略连续适应来优化人形机器人的执行器配置和控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人设计采用顺序流程，硬件完成后才开发控制算法，这限制了硬件能力的充分利用。需要协同设计方法来并行优化设计和控制，最大化机器人性能。

Method: EA-CoRL框架包含两个核心组件：设计进化（使用进化算法探索硬件配置）和策略连续适应（在演化设计中微调任务特定的控制策略以最大化性能奖励）。

Result: 在RH5人形机器人的高动态引体向上任务中，EA-CoRL相比最先进的基于RL的协同设计方法获得了更高的适应度分数和更广泛的设计空间探索。

Conclusion: EA-CoRL证明了策略连续适应在机器人协同设计中的关键作用，能够解决之前因执行器限制而不可行的任务。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,
RF-based communication, and AI-driven decision support. Within a simulated
hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration
to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due
to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead,
validation was carried out through controlled self-testing with wearable
sensors. The Leader Robot acquires key physiological parameters, including
temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots
when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery,
while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired
leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured
continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff.
The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF
modules, and a HuskyLens AI camera. Experimental evaluation showed an overall
sensor accuracy above 94%, a 92% task-level success rate, and a 96%
communication reliability rate, demonstrating system robustness. Furthermore,
the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal
health conditions, highlighting the potential of the system as a cost-effective
solution for hospital automation and patient safety.

Motivation: 海藻养殖向工业化规模转型需要自动化过程，AUV是实现作物和结构检查自动化的关键，但目前瓶颈在于确保养殖场内的安全导航，这需要准确的在线位姿估计和基础设施地图。

Method: 开发了高效的侧扫声纳SLAM框架，利用海藻养殖场的几何结构，在后端将结构绳索建模为每个SSS探测点的单个地标序列。

Result: 在真实海藻养殖场的AUV调查中，该方法在硬件在环实验中优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的SSS SLAM框架能够有效解决海藻养殖场中AUV导航的挑战，为智能养殖提供可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: The transition of seaweed farming to an alternative food source on an
industrial scale relies on automating its processes through smart farming,
equivalent to land agriculture. Key to this process are autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) via their capacity to automate crop and structural inspections.
However, the current bottleneck for their deployment is ensuring safe
navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can
be found at https://github.com/julRusVal/sss_farm_slam.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于径向基函数(RBF)的地形感知LiDAR-惯性里程计框架，通过自适应选择RBF中心并递归更新权重来近似地形，从而在机器人运动过程中缓解z轴姿态漂移问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的方法在非结构化地形(如颠簸道路和楼梯)中运行时，由于忽略地形几何特征，经常遭受姿态漂移问题。

Method: 使用径向基函数(RBF)近似地形，自适应选择RBF中心并递归更新权重，生成平滑地形流形，在里程计优化中施加软约束，并通过GPU并行化确保实时性能。

Result: 在非结构化地形上的实验表明，该方法比现有最先进基线方法实现了更高的定位精度，特别是在具有连续高度变化或稀疏特征且发生突然高度变化的场景中。

Conclusion: 所提出的地形感知LiDAR-惯性里程计框架通过RBF地形建模有效缓解了z轴姿态漂移，在非结构化地形中表现出优越的定位性能。

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了机器人操作中的异常检测方法，通过比较多种基于自动编码器的方法在三种工业任务（布线、拧螺丝、打磨）中的表现，验证了异常检测在不同控制策略和任务类型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作中的分布外状态常导致不可预测行为或任务失败，需要异常检测来触发安全机制。现有方法在特定任务中有效，但缺乏跨控制策略和任务类型的可迁移性验证。

Method: 构建三种工业机器人任务测试场景，收集多模态时间序列数据，比较多种基于自动编码器的异常检测方法，评估其在扩散策略、位置控制和阻抗控制等不同控制方法下的泛化能力。

Result: 在布线和拧螺丝任务中实现了可靠的异常检测（AUROC超过0.93），能检测零件错误、错位和目标受阻等故障。在打磨任务中仅能检测严重故障，细微故障难以检测。

Conclusion: 基于自动编码器的异常检测方法在多种工业机器人任务中具有良好可迁移性，但在不同任务类型中的检测性能存在差异，需要根据任务特性选择合适的检测方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide
high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

### [167] [Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation across Inconsistent World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26339)
*Eric R. Damm,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种基于历史世界模型的运动规划迭代方法（PEH、GEH、GEGRH），用于解决移动机器人在噪声环境中障碍物识别不一致的问题。GEGRH方法在保持规划保守性的同时，实现了比VEH方法更低的轨迹成本和更快的规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动地面机器人在缺乏环境先验知识时，依赖传感器数据建模周围环境。但由于噪声和算法缺陷，障碍物和地形特征的识别可能不一致，导致运动规划系统难以生成安全运动。特别是当成本地图中的区域在连续规划周期中在障碍物和自由空间之间切换时，这个问题尤为突出。

Method: 提出了三种迭代方法：1) PEH：在每次节点扩展跨越世界模型分歧点时调用子搜索；2) GEH：将子搜索推迟到边扩展到目标区域之后；3) GEGRH：在GEH基础上增加基于每个世界中分歧节点修订图的步骤。

Result: PEH和GEH虽然比VEH找到更乐观的解决方案，但无法在1秒内生成解。GEGRH在非结构化越野环境中的现场实验表明，它找到了比VEH成本更低的轨迹，平均规划时间更快。与仅考虑最新世界模型的单假设搜索相比，GEGRH生成更保守的计划，平均规划时间略有增加。

Conclusion: GEGRH方法在保持规划保守性的同时，能够有效处理世界模型不一致的问题，实现了比传统VEH方法更好的性能，适合实际现场部署需求。

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER通过自适应规划范式、状态依赖感知和错误感知机制，为具身任务规划提供了更全面的解决方案，显著提升了规划性能。

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法要么支持任意加速度约束但计算成本高，要么使用保守的箱式约束以提高计算效率，需要在精度和效率之间取得平衡。

Method: FBGA通过前向和后向传递在短离散路径段上最大化速度剖面，同时满足用户定义的性能限制，能够处理复杂的非凸加速度约束。

Conclusion: FBGA即使在粗离散化下也能保持高精度，适合在线多查询轨迹规划，其C++实现已开源。

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的方法来在优化过程中强制执行集合的非穿透约束，适用于碰撞感知轨迹优化等问题。引入了具有解析表达式的可微条件，并提出将多面体近似为光滑半代数集的方法来处理非光滑物体的非碰撞约束。


<details>

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效处理优化过程中的非穿透约束，为碰撞感知轨迹优化等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

TL;DR: 提出LfH-CP自监督框架，通过幻觉关键点生成动态障碍物数据集，无需专家演示或试错探索，显著提升运动规划器的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动态障碍物轨迹空间巨大，生成大规模多样化障碍物数据集具有挑战性，需要解决现有方法依赖昂贵专家演示或探索的问题。

Method: 将幻觉分解为两个阶段：首先识别关键点（障碍物必须出现的时间和位置），然后程序化生成通过这些点且避免碰撞的多样化轨迹。

Result: LfH-CP产生的训练数据比现有基线方法更加多样化，仿真实验显示基于LfH-CP数据集训练的运动规划器成功率更高。

Conclusion: LfH-CP通过关键点幻觉和程序化轨迹生成，有效解决了动态障碍物数据集生成的挑战，提升了运动规划性能。

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.

Conclusion: 提出的树形地图表示方法有效解决了内存效率问题，为机器人群体形状组装提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

Motivation: 传统无线电方法在机器人领域应用有限，但UWB和雷达技术因其对恶劣环境和杂乱环境的鲁棒性而日益流行。需要开发低成本、易获取传感器的多机器人定位系统。

Method: 系统采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用非线性优化框架对UWB测距数据进行三边定位，以及雷达预处理模块；第二阶段将预处理雷达数据和相对变换输入到位姿图优化框架中。系统基于ROS 2和Ceres优化器实现。

Result: 在软件在环仿真和真实世界数据集上的验证表明，该相对定位模块优于现有闭式方法，对噪声更具鲁棒性。系统可扩展至完整SLAM。

Conclusion: 提出的多机器人相对定位系统在噪声环境下表现优异，代码和实验数据已公开，支持可重复性和基准测试。

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and
mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite
on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar
performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while
maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global
visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM

results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动重定向方法存在身体差异问题和交互关系忽视，导致物理不可行和交互信息丢失。

Conclusion: 高质量数据使得强化学习策略能够成功执行长时程技能，仅需少量奖励项和简单领域随机化。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

Conclusion: 多感官语言-动作模型通过协作感知异构感官模态和预测未来多感官目标，有效促进了物理世界建模，在机器人操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug

propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼图求解方法主要依赖视觉线索如边缘匹配和视觉一致性，但在具有侵蚀间隙的挑战性场景中，很少探索使用自然语言描述进行语义指导。

Method: 开发了VLHSA模块，通过从局部标记到全局上下文的多级语义匹配来对齐视觉块与文本描述，并集成了结合双视觉编码器和语言特征的多模态架构进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于最先进模型，实现了包括14.2个百分点碎片准确率提升在内的实质性改进。消融研究证实了VLHSA模块在超越纯视觉方法中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过整合多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法计算开销大且未能有效利用历史token上下文，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 维护top-K logits滑动缓冲区，进行实时奇异值分解识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在高不确定性时激活

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SLS始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现更优准确率

Conclusion: SLS是一种无需更新模型参数的轻量级方法，能有效锐化输出分布同时保持上下文一致性

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法（如GRACE）与同态加密等隐私保护技术不兼容，因为它们依赖非多项式操作，限制了隐私保护图表示学习的应用。

Method: 提出全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数，确保所有操作都与同态加密兼容。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法能够有效加速模型训练收敛，特别是在训练初期，为在双曲流形和其他非欧几里得空间中的学习提供了有益的工具。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降雨分布高度不平衡，大多数观测记录无雨或小雨，而暴雨事件罕见。这种不平衡分布阻碍了深度学习模型有效预测暴雨事件，因此需要专门解决长尾学习问题。

Method: 将降雨预报明确视为长尾学习问题，引入DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富暴雨事件的表示。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的暴雨事件，DPSformer将基线数值天气预报模型的CSI从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%的暴雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为暴雨预测建立了有效的长尾范式，提供了增强预警系统和减轻极端天气事件社会影响的实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

*Remi Genet,Hugo Inzirillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEMs是一种新型深度学习框架，将基于Transformer的架构扩展到具有灵活时间边界和多重执行约束的复杂执行问题，通过解耦市场信息处理和分配决策实现统一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将神经网络VWAP执行策略从固定时长订单推广到执行时长在最小和最大时间范围内变化的场景，类似于股票回购合约结构。

Method: 使用TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理不同场景的执行逻辑，实现市场信息处理与分配决策的解耦。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易中，LEMs相比传统基准实现更优的执行性能，能在灵活时间约束内动态优化执行路径。

Conclusion: 统一模型架构可通过单一框架部署到不同执行场景，相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN超参数优化过程具有挑战性和计算成本高的问题，传统方法需要大量试错或穷举搜索，需要更系统高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数，开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术来统一冲突指标。

Result: 方法3（加权准确率指标与对数变换损失函数结合）实现了最佳性能：训练准确率98.84%，验证准确率86.25%，同时保持最小损失值。学习率是最具影响力的参数。

Conclusion: 田口方法为CNN超参数优化提供了系统框架，学习率、图像尺寸和激活函数是关键参数，该方法可有效指导超参数优先级的确定。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA是一种动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置的方法，无需重复微调，通过配置感知模型将每个配置映射到其低秩调整，并使用帕累托优化配置搜索来提升性能。

Motivation: 随着大型预训练模型的发布，在边缘设备上部署需要有效压缩。现有方法结合量化和高精度LoRA适配器微调，但为每个量化配置单独微调计算成本过高，且边缘设备能力异构。

Method: 提出CoA-LoRA方法，通过配置感知模型动态调整LoRA适配器适应任意量化配置，无需重复微调。设计帕累托基配置搜索优化训练配置集，提高低秩调整精度。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA提供了一种高效适应异构边缘设备量化配置的解决方案，避免了重复微调的计算开销，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多元时间序列异常检测时可能破坏变量间的重要关系，需要一种能保持变量间关系的同时提高检测性能的方法。

Method: 基于变量间多重相关系数的聚类来识别变量子集，为每个子集局部执行异常检测算法，确保变量间关系不受破坏。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过保持变量间关系的分区策略，有效提升了多元时间序列异常检测的效果。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

TL;DR: 论文通过生物分类任务重新审视了机器学习中的双下降现象，发现只有当模型复杂度在两个正交维度（学习器能力和集成规模）上同时扩展时，才会出现双下降现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习理论描述了模型复杂度与预测误差之间的U形关系，但近期研究提出了双下降现象。本研究旨在通过生物分类任务验证双下降现象是否在简单模型中也存在，并探究其产生条件。

Method: 使用全基因组测序数据预测结核分枝杆菌的异烟肼耐药性，系统性地沿着两个正交维度（学习器能力和集成规模）变化模型复杂度，分析泛化行为。

Result: 只有当复杂度在两个维度上同时扩展时，才会出现双下降现象；如果任一维度固定，泛化行为会恢复为经典的U形或L形模式。

Conclusion: 模型复杂度应被视为多维结构，双下降现象源于不同泛化机制在单一复杂度轴上的投影。这些发现在合成基准测试中得到了验证。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Motivation: 概率图模型中最可能解释推理是一个本质上难以处理的问题，需要开发可扩展的加速方法。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据生成管道，从现有MPE求解器的搜索轨迹中提取训练信号，训练神经网络作为启发式函数，与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在涉及高树宽概率图模型的挑战性MPE查询上，学习到的启发式显著减少了搜索空间，同时保持或改进了解决方案质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架成功地将学习技术应用于加速MPE推理，展示了数据驱动方法在解决复杂推理问题中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: TinyML技术在计算、内存和能源方面的特定约束需要专门的优化技术，而深度神经网络之外的动态集成选择方法在TinyML中具有潜在优势。

Method: 开发了TinyDES-Clustering库，采用动态集成选择聚类方法，针对嵌入式系统限制进行优化，通过调整分类器池大小来平衡精度和性能。

Result: 实验表明，更大的分类器池可以提高分类精度，但会导致TinyML设备上平均推理时间的增加。

Conclusion: 动态集成选择聚类方法为TinyML系统提供了一种在分类精度和推理性能之间进行权衡的有效途径。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供线性时间替代方案，但在捕捉长距离模式时表现不佳，现有变体存在表达能力瓶颈

Method: 通过预测-校正视角重新审视线性注意力，引入RLA框架，维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并校正基础预测，并实例化RDN版本包含自适应门控和残差裁剪

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距同时保持线性扩展

Conclusion: RLA框架有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力瓶颈，在保持线性复杂度的同时显著提升了性能

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Conclusion: MSCoD通过多尺度特征提取和不对称注意力机制，有效解决了蛋白质-配体相互作用建模中的关键挑战，为结构基药物设计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Conclusion: 该框架展示了优越的预测精度、鲁棒性和自动化程度，为集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的可靠运行和优化调度提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Conclusion: RPFs在理论和实践上都有效，为生成建模提供了强大基线，并建立了随机投影理论与归一化流之间的桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay

this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation

rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

### [201] [Sampling via Gaussian Mixture Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25232)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一系列高斯混合近似(GMA)采样器，用于从非归一化目标密度中采样，包括权重优化GMA、拉普拉斯混合近似、期望最大化GMA等变体。该方法采用两阶段范式：从高斯混合提议中采样，然后通过优化KL散度目标来拟合目标分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种无需梯度、计算高效且仅需非归一化密度评估的采样方法，以解决复杂目标分布的采样问题。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 初始化高斯分量并从混合提议中采样；2) 通过优化KL散度目标（仅优化权重或同时优化均值和方差）来拟合目标分布，然后进行分层重采样。

Result: 该方法在温和条件下产生一致的近似，经验验证显示在多种密度函数上具有高精度和快速采样速度。

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种高效、无梯度且仅需非归一化密度评估的采样框架，在各种目标分布上表现出良好的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCLF是一种针对车辆互联网网络的联邦学习方法，通过校准损失和反馈控制机制解决数据异构性问题，在高度异构数据场景下比基线模型性能提升高达16%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在车辆互联网网络中面临高度数据异构性和设备异构性的挑战，需要提高模型精度并优化资源受限环境下的资源利用效率。

Method: 提出FedCLF方法，在参与者选择过程中引入校准损失作为效用指标，并使用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedCLF在高度数据异构场景下相比FedAvg、Newt和Oort等基线模型性能提升高达16%，同时通过减少采样频率提高了效率。

Conclusion: FedCLF通过校准损失和反馈控制机制有效解决了联邦学习在车辆互联网网络中的异构性问题，显著提升了模型精度和资源利用效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Method: 采用基于特征的时间序列分类框架，在领域专家指导下选择时间和空间特征，评估多个传统机器学习分类器，最终选择One-vs-Rest随机森林。

Result: 提出的模型在多个故障机制的加权F1分数上优于内部基于规则的基准方法。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效分类打印头故障，为产品质量控制提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

TL;DR: PALADIN是一个增强语言代理故障恢复能力的框架，通过系统故障注入和专家演示训练，在真实工具环境中实现稳健恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理训练只优化成功轨迹，无法应对真实世界中普遍存在的工具故障（如超时、API异常、输出不一致），导致级联推理错误和任务放弃。

Method: 在增强的ToolBench数据集上构建50,000+恢复注释轨迹，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力同时注入恢复能力；推理时检测执行错误并从55+故障示例库中检索相似案例执行恢复动作。

Result: 在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中，恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%（相对提升57%），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%；对未见工具API保持95.2%恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

TL;DR: 提出HAMMER方法，通过多样性指标和最小语义汉密尔顿路径排序训练样本，增强LLM在课程强化学习中的探索能力，避免局部优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 将数据集评估中常用的多样性指标引入动态强化学习过程，通过最小语义汉密尔顿路径对训练样本进行排序，使初始训练保持更多探索。

Result: HAMMER激发模型"好奇心"，在多样化推理基准测试中平均准确率提升3%到4%。

Conclusion: 从泛化界限的理论视角看，多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，HAMMER方法有效解决了课程强化学习中的探索问题。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要专家知识的专业领域（如网络安全）中的零样本表现往往不理想，因为基础模型是为通用应用设计的，难以在参数空间中封装领域特定知识。

Method: 研究了监督微调(SFT)、低秩适应(LoRA)和量化低秩适应(QLoRA)三种微调策略，使用网络安全问答数据集进行训练。

Result: 所有微调方法在网络安全问答任务中都显著优于基础模型。LoRA和QLoRA在性能上与SFT相当，但计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略为将通用大型语言模型适应到专业领域提供了高效途径，能够弥合通用模型与领域特定应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法（如投影均方损失或CKA）无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征空间结构，即使损失为零时也存在问题。

Method: 采用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失函数，这些距离在表示对齐测量中已被广泛使用。

Result: 在BERT和OPT语言模型家族的分类和指令跟随任务中，蒸馏性能提升了最多2个百分点，具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将特征几何整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，能够有效提升知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了RainfallBench基准数据集，专门用于降雨临近预报（0-3小时），包含5年全球12,000多个GNSS站的气象数据，特别包含可降水量水汽(PWV)指标。同时提出了Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF)模块来提升降雨时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间序列预测基准主要针对温度、湿度等具有强周期性的变量，无法反映模型在降雨临近预报这种更复杂、更具实际意义的场景中的能力。降雨预报具有零膨胀、时间衰减和非平稳性等独特挑战。

Method: 构建RainfallBench数据集，包含5年15分钟间隔的6个气象变量数据；设计专门的评估策略来评估多尺度预测和极端降雨事件；提出BFPF模块，这是一个即插即用模块，融入领域先验知识来处理零膨胀和时间衰减问题。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准的空白，BFPF模块能有效提升降雨时间序列预测性能，为实际气象应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）在效率和准确性之间存在刚性权衡，准确策略如Self-Consistency在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: PPN将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO算法训练，并采用资源显式奖励函数来学习仅在必要时分配高成本推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性帕累托前沿上表现优异，相比Self-Consistency可减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为成本高效的LLM部署提供了一个系统化的自适应框架，推进了轻量级优化技术在可扩展和可持续语言模型应用中的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

TL;DR: InfMasking是一种对比协同信息提取方法，通过无限掩码策略增强多模态表示中的协同信息，在七个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态表示学习中，模态间的协同交互不仅提供互补信息，还能产生单一模态无法实现的独特结果。现有方法难以有效捕捉完整的协同信息频谱，导致在协同交互关键任务中表现欠佳。

Method: 提出InfMasking方法，在融合过程中随机遮挡每个模态的大部分特征，仅保留部分信息以创建具有不同协同模式的表示。通过互信息最大化将未掩码融合表示与掩码表示对齐，编码全面的协同信息。

Result: 在受控实验中证明InfMasking能有效增强模态间的协同信息。在大规模真实世界数据集评估中，在七个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功解决了多模态表示中协同信息提取的挑战，为多模态学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，通过动态跨模态交互、符号化标记和稀疏注意力机制，解决了现有方法依赖单一主模态、成对建模和完整模态观察的局限性，在完整和部分缺失模态情况下均表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法存在三个主要局限：依赖单一主模态进行对齐、成对建模模态、假设完整模态观察。这些限制阻碍了在真实世界多模态时间序列场景中的应用，因为主模态先验不明确、模态数量可能很大、传感器故障导致任意缺失观察。

Method: MAESTRO通过动态模态内和跨模态交互、符号化标记和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，使用稀疏跨模态注意力处理，并通过稀疏专家混合机制路由跨模态标记，实现不同模态组合下的黑盒专业化。

Result: 在四个不同应用的数据集上评估，MAESTRO在完整观察下比最佳多模态和多变量方法分别平均提升4%和8%；在部分观察（高达40%缺失模态）下平均提升9%。分析还证明了其稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中的鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: MAESTRO框架有效克服了现有多模态学习方法的局限性，在完整和部分缺失模态情况下均表现出优越性能，为真实世界多模态时间序列分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Motivation: 传统方法在异构无线网络中难以应对变化的用户负载和信道条件，需要更智能的资源分配方案。

Method: 使用深度强化学习框架，采用PPO和TD3算法，基于真实基站坐标，在多种网络场景下与三种启发式算法进行比较。

Result: 深度强化学习框架在动态网络中的资源分配优化方面优于启发式算法。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了深度强化学习在未来异构无线网络设计中的关键权衡问题。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

TL;DR: ClustRecNet是一个基于深度学习的推荐框架，用于为给定数据集选择最合适的聚类算法，解决了无监督学习中聚类算法选择的长期挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督学习中聚类算法选择的挑战，传统方法依赖手工设计的元特征和聚类有效性指标，存在局限性。

Method: 构建包含34,000个合成数据集的综合数据仓库，使用10种流行聚类算法处理，通过调整兰德指数评估聚类结果建立真实标签。网络架构整合卷积、残差和注意力机制，捕捉输入数据的局部和全局结构模式。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过深度学习有效解决了聚类算法选择问题，减少了对手工元特征和传统聚类有效性指标的依赖，在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

TL;DR: 本文通过54个实验系统研究了LLM在RL后训练中的缩放规律，发现在固定计算预算下，大模型少步训练优于小模型多步训练；固定数据量时，大模型样本效率更高；数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；这些规律在基础模型和指令微调模型中均适用。


<details>

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型预训练阶段的缩放规律已被广泛研究，但RL后训练中的缩放行为仍未被充分探索，特别是在数学推理任务上。

Method: 基于54个实验，系统研究模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的交互作用，涵盖不同模型大小和训练设置。

Result: 发现四个关键规律：1) 固定计算预算下大模型少步训练更优；2) 固定数据量时大模型样本效率更高；3) 数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；4) 这些规律在不同类型模型中均适用。

Conclusion: 为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了LEO-CVAE方法，通过局部熵引导的过采样解决类别不平衡问题，特别针对高维生物医学数据中的非线性流形结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，常产生不合理的合成样本；而深度生成模型如CVAE虽然能更好捕捉非线性分布，但忽视了边界区域不确定样本的重要性。

Method: LEO-CVAE框架通过计算样本邻域的香农熵来量化不确定性，采用局部熵加权损失强调不确定区域的鲁棒学习，并使用熵引导的采样策略在信息丰富的类重叠区域集中生成样本。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上的实验表明，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样方法和生成基线模型。

Conclusion: 结果表明，对于受复杂非线性结构支配的领域（如组学数据），不确定性感知的生成过采样在类别不平衡学习中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索梯度下降在矩阵分解中的动力学行为，特别是大步长情况下参数空间的结构变化和收敛特性。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量-向量分解的临界步长，研究正则化对收敛边界的影响，并将分析扩展到正交初始化的通用矩阵分解。

Result: 发现临界步长附近存在混沌区域，梯度下降的长期动态不可预测，且不存在简单的隐式偏置（如平衡性、最小范数或平坦性）。

Conclusion: 大步长梯度下降在矩阵分解中会产生分形结构和混沌行为，导致收敛结果对初始化高度敏感，缺乏稳定的隐式偏置。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了训练重评估曲线(TREC)的概念，用于分析训练数据在模型训练过程中的保留效果，并发现将高质量数据放置在TREC低谷能显著提升模型性能。TREC可以通过AdamW的隐式EMA系数提前预测，从而优化数据课程设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM训练中数据课程设计至关重要，但缺乏明确的数据放置原则。需要一种方法来诊断训练数据在不同训练阶段的保留效果，以优化数据放置策略。

Method: 引入训练重评估曲线(TREC)，使用最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次。分析不同规模模型(111M到3.9B参数)的TREC，并利用AdamW的隐式EMA系数预测TREC。

Result: 研究表明将高质量数据放置在TREC低谷能显著提升性能。TREC可以提前预测，成功解释了先前消融实验并揭示了次优数据放置。在3.9B参数LLM的持续预训练中，将高质量数据与TREC最小值对齐取得了改进。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了重要指导，通过预测和优化数据放置位置，可以有效提升LLM训练效果。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Result: 在模拟数据集和真实世界ICU案例研究中，FCRN在预测准确性上显著优于随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型。

Conclusion: FCRN通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时适应不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛(HMC)从干净输入中抽取后验样本，并与从噪声数据获得的编码器输出进行比较。

Result: 模型能准确重建信号，但统计比较显示潜在空间存在明显不匹配，表明去噪性能强不代表潜在表示可靠。

Conclusion: 在评估生成模型时，使用基于后验的验证方法至关重要，仅凭重建精度不足以评估潜在空间的可靠性。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the

framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断可以有效缓解方程发现中的过拟合问题，促进模型泛化，特别适用于结构健康监测等应用场景。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成方面表现出色，但计算需求巨大限制了其部署。现有的稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs用于注意力块，利用稀疏符号消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性、与稀疏比匹配的加速(1:1)，在GEMM-O中实现2.5-3.8倍加速(达到理论极限的87.5%)。应用多粒度稀疏策略使Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速，且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用高效的稀疏计算解决方案，显著提升了多模态扩散变换器的推理效率，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA适配器中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这主要是由于相同初始化而非共享知识，B矩阵在知识编码和传输中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（多任务微调中多个A矩阵共享单个B）和Fed-ALoRA（联邦学习中跨客户端共享B），通过新颖的矩阵分解策略处理客户端间的异构秩。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，我们的方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了跨任务更平衡的性能。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA通过非对称设计有效提升了多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡性，验证了B矩阵共享策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HIA的新型黑盒攻击框架，专门针对时序图神经网络(TGNNs)，通过识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，结合边注入和边删除的混合扰动策略，显著降低TGNNs在链接预测任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对时空动态图的攻击方法通常依赖简单易检测的扰动，无法战略性针对最具影响力的节点和边。TGNNs在对抗利用时间维度的复杂攻击方面的鲁棒性仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: HIA利用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点（网络连通性中心）和动态重要节点（图时序演化的关键节点），采用混合扰动策略结合战略性边注入和针对性边删除，同时最小化扰动数量以提高隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实世界数据集和4个代表性TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低了TGNN在链接预测任务上的准确性，在平均倒数排名(MRR)上实现了高达35.55%的下降，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了当前STDG模型的基本脆弱性，强调了迫切需要开发能够同时考虑结构和时间动态的鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

*Jubayer Ibn Hamid,Ifdita Hasan Orney,Ellen Xu,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为polychromic objective的新目标函数，用于解决强化学习微调中策略多样性丧失的问题，通过改进PPO算法来保持和利用多样化的生成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLFT方法在微调预训练策略时容易导致策略多样性丧失，收敛到少数易被利用的输出，这阻碍了探索并限制了测试时计算扩展的效益。

Method: 采用vine采样收集策略轨迹，并修改优势函数以反映新目标下的优势，通过polychromic objective显式强制多样化的生成探索和精炼。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity上的实验表明，该方法提高了成功率，能可靠解决更多环境配置，在大扰动下泛化更好，且在pass@k实验中实现了更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: polychromic objective能有效维持策略多样性，使策略能够保持和利用多样化的策略库，从而提升性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

TL;DR: 提出B2R框架，通过非对称条件化解决离线安全强化学习中序列模型对称输入的问题，将成本到目标重新定义为边界约束，在38个安全关键任务中35个满足安全约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列模型方法对回报到目标和成本到目标使用对称输入标记，忽略了它们内在的不对称性：回报到目标是灵活性能目标，而成本到目标应是刚性安全边界。这种对称条件化导致不可靠的约束满足。

Method: B2R框架通过成本信号重新对齐实现非对称条件化，将成本到目标重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，统一所有可行轨迹的成本分布，同时结合旋转位置嵌入增强安全区域内探索。

Result: 实验结果显示B2R在38个安全关键任务中的35个满足安全约束，同时在奖励性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件化的局限性，并为序列模型在安全强化学习中的应用建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Motivation: 在线广告中预算节奏控制对于在动态拍卖中实现广告支出与活动目标对齐至关重要，现有方法依赖临时参数调整，存在不稳定和低效的问题。

Method: 采用分桶滞后与比例反馈相结合的控制方法，提供了参数选择的框架和分析，确保在不同广告活动中准确跟踪期望支出率。

Result: 在真实拍卖环境中的实验显示，相比基线方法，节奏准确性提高了13%，波动性降低了54%，特别是在小预算活动中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，该方法为预算节奏控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，特别有利于小预算广告活动。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控(LPM)的新方法来解决内在奖励探索中的噪声TV问题，通过监控模型改进而非预测误差来引导探索，在噪声环境中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内在奖励探索中智能体容易被不可学习的随机噪声源(噪声TV)困住的问题，现有方法虽然最终能逃离但样本效率低、计算成本高。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在之前迭代中的预期预测误差，利用当前迭代与之前迭代模型误差的差异来引导探索。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM概念简单但实现了噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，通过奖励模型改进而非预测误差来有效避免被不可学习的转换困住。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

TL;DR: 提出Norm-Q方法，一种用于压缩概率符号模型（如HMM）的标准化线性量化方法，通过减少数据位宽来缓解内存和带宽压力，实现高压缩率。


<details>

Motivation: 神经符号应用中使用的HMM模型计算密集且数据传输量大，通信效率低，需要压缩方法来缓解内存和带宽压力。

Method: 采用标准化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，通过减少数据位宽实现压缩。

Result: 在大型语言模型的约束生成任务中，成功将4096个隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失，权重压缩率达到99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法相比传统量化方法实现了更高的压缩率和合理的分数损失，适用于概率符号模型的压缩部署。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于联合嵌入开发未来时间序列基础模型奠定了基础，展示了其作为学习通用表示的稳健基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Motivation: 通用机器人策略通常需要大量专家数据或模拟训练，本文旨在开发数据高效的多任务学习方法，减少对专家数据的依赖。

Method: 采用性能感知调度策略，基于卡尔曼滤波器估计器跟踪每个任务的学习进度，智能分配额外演示数据给表现不佳的任务。

Result: 在MetaWorld和IsaacLab的抽屉开启任务套件上验证，获得高性能的同时显著减少专家演示需求，仿真学习的视觉策略在零样本迁移到真实机器人时表现优于朴素DAgger和行为克隆。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地从多个专家策略中蒸馏出单一多任务策略，在减少数据需求的同时保持高性能，并具有良好的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非一致性评分，将平滑的符合预测层直接嵌入训练过程，使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和符合预测集，训练后通过精确的符合预测程序提供统计保证。

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测的不确定性（在保持高覆盖率的同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性（使用固定阈值时的误分类数量）。

Conclusion: 该方法同时提高了信号时序逻辑推理的可靠性和可解释性，在减少不确定性和提高准确性方面优于现有最先进基线方法。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统需要复杂的多电极设置，限制了移动监测应用，而基于PPG的方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es框架，包含前向过程的频域模糊和时间噪声干扰，反向过程的时间多尺度生成和频域去模糊，以及基于KNN聚类和对比学习的人口统计感知机制。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联ECG，为移动心血管监测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Conclusion: PageANN通过页面节点图结构和协调的内存-磁盘管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的I/O瓶颈，实现了高性能和可扩展的大规模向量搜索。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Motivation: 分子基础模型在科学发现中应用广泛，但在分布外样本上的不可靠性限制了其在药物发现等高风险领域的应用，特别是化学幻觉问题。

Method: Mole-PAIR是一个即插即用模块，通过偏好优化估计ID和OOD样本之间的亲和度，使用成对学习目标来优化AUROC指标。

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力，在尺寸、支架和检测分布偏移下AUROC分别提升了45.8%、43.9%和24.3%。

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一个简单有效的解决方案，能够通过低成本的后训练显著提高分子基础模型在分布外数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

### [242] [Flow Matching with Semidiscrete Couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25519)
*Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Stephen Y. Zhang,Michal Klein,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种半离散流匹配方法，通过解决半离散最优传输问题来改进流匹配训练，避免了传统OT-FM方法的二次计算复杂度瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OT-FM方法虽然理论上很有前景，但在实践中由于Sinkhorn算法的高计算成本而难以广泛应用，特别是当批次大小增加时计算复杂度呈二次增长。

Method: 采用半离散最优传输公式，通过SGD估计对偶势向量，然后使用最大内积搜索将新采样的噪声向量与数据点匹配，消除了对批次大小的二次依赖。

Result: SD-FM在所有训练指标和推理预算约束下均优于FM和OT-FM，在多个数据集、无条件/条件生成以及使用均值流模型的情况下都表现出色。

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配方法实现了OT-FM的理论承诺，同时避免了计算瓶颈，为流匹配训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果推断的LLM路由器训练框架，通过结合黄金标准和偏好数据来降低推理成本并保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。现有路由器训练面临可靠监督数据稀缺的问题：黄金标准数据准确但昂贵，偏好数据便宜但存在偏差。

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推断框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配。基于此视角开发了整合性因果路由器训练框架，纠正偏好数据偏差，处理两个数据源的不平衡，提高路由鲁棒性和效率。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能提供更准确的路由，并在成本和质量之间实现更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过因果推断框架整合黄金标准和偏好数据，可以有效训练高质量的LLM路由器，在降低推理成本的同时保持响应质量。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成建模和主动学习的队列优先级算法，用于解决科学中的逆设计问题，显著提高了高质量候选分子的生成数量。


<details>

Motivation: 生成式AI在解决科学逆设计问题时既能扩展搜索空间，也会探索低质量区域，需要平衡机会与风险。

Method: 在分布式工作流中结合生成建模和主动学习，使用主动学习模型来优先处理顶级设计候选，防止资源浪费在无意义候选上。

Conclusion: 主动学习能有效防止生成模型衰减，显著提高生成式AI工作流在复杂设计空间探索中的效率和质量。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

TL;DR: FedIF是一种高效的联邦学习聚合框架，使用基于轨迹的影响力估计来计算客户端贡献，在保持鲁棒性的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临非独立同分布数据和恶意客户端的鲁棒性挑战，现有基于Shapley值的方法计算开销过高，限制了可扩展性。

Method: FedIF通过轻量级梯度操作和公共验证集计算归一化和平滑的影响力分数，实现去中心化的联邦学习适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST上的实验表明，FedIF在标签噪声、梯度噪声和对抗样本下达到或超过SV方法的鲁棒性，同时将聚合开销降低450倍。

Conclusion: FedIF为现实世界部署提供了一个实用、理论可靠且可扩展的联邦学习鲁棒聚合替代方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

TL;DR: 提出了首个在上下文强化学习中确保安全适应的方法，通过约束马尔可夫决策过程框架，在无参数更新的适应过程中同时最大化奖励和最小化成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文强化学习能够在无参数更新的情况下适应分布外任务，但现有方法缺乏对适应过程安全性的考虑，需要确保智能体在最大化奖励的同时也能满足安全约束。

Method: 在约束马尔可夫决策过程框架下，将安全约束整合到ICRL中，使智能体在适应过程中同时优化奖励和成本函数，并能根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为策略。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效控制智能体的行为安全性，智能体会根据成本预算主动调整行为：预算较高时行为更激进，预算较低时行为更保守。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了ICRL的安全适应，为无参数更新的强化学习系统提供了安全保障机制，使智能体能够根据安全需求灵活调整行为策略。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒优化方法在高维、噪声或混合整数设置中表现不佳，需要结合ML和RL技术来提升性能。

Method: 涵盖多种代表性算法：基于神经网络的mlrMBO、ZO-AdaMM、ABBO、DiBB、SPBOpt、B2Opt、扩散模型、Surr-RLDE、RBO、CAS-MORE、LB-SGD、PIBB和Q-Mamba。

Conclusion: ML和RL技术将经典的不精确求解器转变为更适合现实世界优化的可扩展、鲁棒和自适应框架。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了二元稀疏自编码器（BAE）和二元转码器（BTC），通过将激活值限制为0或1来提高特征的解释性和单义性，但会增加重建误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAE）的许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释，希望通过二元化消除连续激活变化带来的不可解释信息。

Method: 使用二元稀疏自编码器（BAE）和二元转码器（BTC），将所有激活值约束为0或1。

Result: 二元化显著提高了发现特征的解释性和单义性，但增加了重建误差和不可解释的超高频特征数量。频率调整后，连续稀疏编码器的解释性得分略优于二元编码器。

Conclusion: 多义性可能是神经网络激活的不可消除特性，二元化虽然改善了某些方面的解释性，但也带来了新的挑战。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EMP（有效模型剪枝），一种与上下文无关、无需参数的通用剪枝规则，通过计算有效数量N_eff来确定保留多少参数，适用于各种剪枝标准和模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决剪枝中的基本问题：应该保留多少参数？现有方法通常需要手动设置阈值或依赖特定上下文，缺乏通用性。

Method: 基于逆辛普森指数思想，将任意评分向量s映射到内置有效数量N_eff，保留得分最高的N_eff个参数，其余置零。利用单纯形几何推导保留质量的下界。

Result: 在MLP、CNN、Transformer/LLM和KAN等模型上实验表明，使用EMP剪枝的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一个鲁棒的通用剪枝阈值，默认β=1效果良好，β≠1可作为可选调整以满足特定稀疏性要求。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保电网弹性需要及时且无监督地检测同步相量数据流中的异常，传统方法依赖人工标注的故障数据，难以适应实时监控需求。

Method: 采用自注意力编码器-解码器架构捕获电网复杂的时空依赖关系，通过联合判别器强制执行循环一致性来对齐学习到的潜在空间与真实数据分布，使用结合重构误差、潜在空间漂移和判别器置信度的自适应评分进行实时异常标记。

Result: 在真实的硬件在环PMU基准测试中，T-BiGAN实现了0.95的ROC-AUC和0.996的平均精度，显著优于领先的监督和无监督方法，在检测细微频率和电压偏差方面表现尤为出色。

Conclusion: T-BiGAN证明了在不依赖人工标注故障数据的情况下，能够有效进行实时广域监控，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

TL;DR: 提出D-Rank框架，通过动态分配秩来优化LLM的SVD压缩，考虑不同层的信息密度差异，在固定压缩率下实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一压缩率，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异（中间层信息更丰富，首尾层更冗余）。

Method: 使用有效秩衡量权重矩阵信息密度，通过拉格朗日乘子优化方案动态分配秩，并对注意力层进行秩重平衡，扩展到分组查询注意力模型。

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩率下，D-Rank始终优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing，在LLaMA-3-8B上困惑度降低15%以上，LLaMA-7B零样本推理准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过动态秩分配有效解决了SVD压缩中的层间异质性问题，在保持高吞吐量的同时显著提升了压缩模型的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其典型的缓慢迭代求解器在推理过程中使其不适用于需要长提前期和领域驱动校准的次季节到季节(S2S)应用。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现基于CRPS目标的概率流模型自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动。

Result: Swift产生熟练的6小时预报，可稳定运行长达75天，比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，同时达到与基于数值的运营IFS ENS相当的预报技能。

Conclusion: 这标志着从中期到季节尺度实现高效可靠集合预报的重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，在单索引教师模型框架下，分析预条件器如何通过Gram矩阵传递输入信息并引入可控的光谱偏置。

Result: 研究发现学习到的特征表示紧密反映了预条件器引入的光谱偏置——偏好被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件表现出降低的敏感性。当这种光谱偏置与教师模型的对齐时，泛化性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过引入可控的光谱偏置影响特征学习，泛化性能的关键在于预条件器的光谱偏置与教师模型的对齐程度，这为理解预条件处理在泛化中的作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

TL;DR: 提出了UQ-SONet，一种具有内置不确定性量化的置换不变算子学习框架，解决了DeepONets在传感器约束和不确定性量化方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DeepONets需要固定传感器数量和位置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了实际应用。虽然VIDON等扩展放松了传感器约束，但仍依赖密集观测且无法处理测量不完整或算子随机性带来的不确定性。

Method: 集成集合变换器嵌入处理稀疏和可变传感器位置，采用条件变分自编码器（cVAE）近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO提供原则性不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了算子学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将确定性神经网络验证中有效的分支定界与预激活分割框架扩展到概率验证场景

Method: 提出BaB-prob方法，通过分割预激活将原问题分解为子问题，利用线性边界传播计算每个子问题的概率边界，并引入不确定性水平和两种高效分割策略

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中，BaB-prob在中等至高维输入问题上始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: BaB-prob为前馈ReLU神经网络提供了概率验证的有效解决方案，在复杂场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

*Qihang Yao,Constantine Dovrolis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种从稀疏到稠密的训练方法，通过路径权重乘积引导的随机增长自动发现网络的最佳密度，相比传统剪枝方法显著降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先固定目标密度，限制了实际应用。

Method: 从稀疏种子开始，PWMPR通过路径核启发式分数引导添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，并在逻辑拟合规则检测到精度平台时停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验表明，PWMPR能够接近IMP彩票的性能（虽然密度更高），但训练成本显著降低（约1.5倍稠密训练 vs IMP的3-4倍）。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，能够补充剪枝和动态稀疏方法。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由机制忽略了模态间信息丰富且随时间变化的交互动态，这限制了专家专业化，无法显式利用模态间内在关系进行有效推理。

Method: 构建多模态交互感知路由器，基于token的交互性质动态分配至专家；提出新的时序多模态交互动态公式化方法，用于指导专家路由。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升和可解释性改进。

Conclusion: 时序多模态交互揭示了有意义的模式，可用于改进MoE模型的设计和性能，实现更好的专家专业化和泛化能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法在极小输入级解释与模型内部计算机制理解之间建立了实用桥梁，提供了对模型决策驱动机制的系统性理解。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字典学习主要关注单个样本的表示稀疏性，忽略了原子在样本间的共享模式，导致字典冗余和次优。需要一种能促进跨样本原子共享稀疏性的方法。

Method: 引入基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的正则化器，结合Beta-Bernoulli先验的概率模型推导，提供贝叶斯解释并建立超参数选择理论。

Result: 在基准数据集上，方法实现重建质量显著提升（RMSE降低20%），表示稀疏性增强，仅使用不到十分之一的字典原子。

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进跨样本的原子共享稀疏性，有效解决了字典冗余问题，理论分析得到实证验证，在重建质量和稀疏性方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction

uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Result: 实验结果表明TSQA模型不仅能成功使用伪标签训练，还能通过利用大量未标注数据超越VLM本身的性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中标注数据不足的问题，通过伪标签训练实现了比VLM更好的性能

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据规模越来越大，直接处理变得困难甚至不可行。针对大规模数据定制算法可能会牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练GNN并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类对图进行粗化，在训练过程中动态合并节点，而不是作为预处理步骤。

Result: 在同性恋和异性恋节点分类数据集上验证了该方法，并通过可视化节点嵌入与对应聚类的关系，证明粗化图在训练过程中能够适应学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应学习任务，特别适用于其他方法难以处理的场景，如异性恋数据，且节点聚类可以根据学习任务进行调整。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法存在局限：无训练方法依赖手动调参，训练方法主要对齐参数而非下游任务行为，且通常忽略层间异质性。

Method: Expert Merging使用少量无标签校准数据学习层间系数，通过隐藏状态和对数对齐优化，加入正则化和任务加权损失。Expert Merging++进一步引入重要性引导分块，根据学习系数、任务向量大小和参数数量分配分块系数。

Result: 在InternVL、Qwen2-VL和Mistral等骨干网络上，该方法超越了强基线方法，Expert Merging++在某些情况下甚至超过监督混合训练。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需标签、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型融合方案，在LLM和MLLM上表现出色。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏差问题，为数据质量控制提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，其安全漏洞日益受到关注。现有机器学习遗忘方法依赖保留数据集且面临连续遗忘请求下的累积灾难性效用损失问题。

Method: RCU方法利用旋转显著性权重量化控制遗忘程度，设计斜对称损失构建认知旋转空间，通过旋转角度变化模拟连续遗忘过程，并使用正交旋转轴正则化最小化干扰。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续遗忘过程中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，为大语言模型的安全防护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Motivation: 解决PPO-based RLHF训练管道的低效问题，包括顺序多模型依赖性和长尾响应长度导致的训练瓶颈。

Method: 引入两种新技术：1) 步内重叠，将上游模型输出流式传输给下游模型；2) 步间重叠，自适应地过度提交短提示并推迟长生成。

Result: OPPO加速PPO-based RLHF训练1.8-2.8倍，提高GPU利用率1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个高效、轻量级且模型无关的RLHF框架，仅需少量代码修改即可集成到现有PPO实现中。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中实体通常具有局部自主性，会覆盖预设的关联关系，这显著影响聚类结果（改变簇组成、几何形状和数量），但现有聚类方法大多假设实体是被动的。

Method: 结合强化学习与确定性退火过程，在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用。还提出了自适应距离估计网络（ADEN），这是一个基于transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与簇代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有显式的自主性模型，该框架也能获得接近真实情况的解（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致更大差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能够有效捕捉和适应实体的局部自主性，显著提升聚类性能，且具有可转移性和适应性。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，智能体可以在在线学习中动态创建新动作，但动作生成通常需要成本，需要平衡潜在收益与生成成本。

Method: 提出双重乐观算法，使用下置信界(LCB)进行动作选择，使用上置信界(UCB)进行动作生成，解决利用、探索和生成之间的三角权衡问题。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法相比基线策略实现了更优的生成-质量权衡。理论上证明了算法达到了最优遗憾界O(T^{d/(d+2)}d^{d/(d+2)} + d√(T log T))。

Conclusion: 该算法是首个为扩展动作空间的在线学习提供次线性遗憾界的解决方案，有效平衡了动作生成成本与学习收益。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Conclusion: 该研究为处理后处理选择偏差的因果发现问题提供了新视角和有效方法，超越了传统的等价类限制。

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Motivation: 解决GRPO算法在响应组内奖励相同时出现的优势消失问题，提高强化学习验证奖励(RLVR)范式的采样效率。

Method: 提出自适应采样和响应重用两种技术：自适应采样动态分配更多响应给困难提示，节省简单提示的计算；响应重用利用之前生成的正確响应提供训练信号。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO持续优于GRPO，与DAPO性能相当或更好，采样成本降低达4.2倍；在32B模型上，AR3PO与DAPO性能相当但采样成本显著更低。

Conclusion: AR3PO通过自适应采样和响应重用有效解决了GRPO的优势消失问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了RLVR算法的采样成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

Result: 在两个常见的零样本基准测试（GIFT-Eval和时间序列库基准）上，Kairos以更少的参数实现了卓越性能，在各种任务中持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理机制有效解决了时间序列信息密度不均的挑战，为时间序列基础模型提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强策略，通过生成语义不一致的多模态错位样本来解决模态不平衡问题，结合弱模态加权和难样本加权机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型往往过度依赖主导模态，无法达到最优性能。现有方法主要关注修改训练目标或优化过程，而数据中心的解决方案尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS数据增强策略：1）生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2）使用单模态置信度进行标注；3）引入弱模态加权机制，动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；4）提出难样本加权机制，优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试上的实验表明，MIDAS在解决模态不平衡问题上显著优于相关基线方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据增强和双重加权机制有效解决了多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，使模型能够更好地利用较弱模态并区分不同类别。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Concrete Score Distillation (CSD)方法，通过离散分数匹配克服传统知识蒸馏中softmax平滑和logit平移不变性问题，在LLM蒸馏中实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法使用softmax匹配概率会模糊有价值的logit信息，而直接logit蒸馏又受限于logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: 提出CSD方法，解决自回归LLM中离散分数匹配的训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题，通过灵活加权对齐学生和教师在所有词汇对上的相对logit差异。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD持续超越最近的知识蒸馏目标，实现有利的保真度-多样性权衡，并与策略技术结合产生互补增益。

Conclusion: CSD展示了在LLM蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为高效推理提供了更好的蒸馏方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

TL;DR: 提出S^2FS框架，通过整合空间方向信息的可分性准则进行特征选择，提升模糊决策系统的分类性能和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么评估标准与学习性能不直接对齐，要么仅依赖非方向性欧氏距离，无法清晰界定决策边界，而实例的空间分布对边界清晰度有重要影响

Method: 基于空间感知可分性准则，联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离度，整合标量距离与空间方向信息，采用前向贪婪策略迭代选择最具区分性的特征

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的实验表明，S^2FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上均优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性

Conclusion: S^2FS通过空间感知可分性准则有效提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择性能，在保持可解释性的同时显著改善了分类和聚类效果

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，解决LLM自改进中均匀分配导致的梯度消失问题，显著提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自改进方法采用均匀探索预算分配，导致简单任务过度探索而困难任务探索不足，两者都产生零梯度，影响训练效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO中非零策略梯度比例提高20-40%，可为困难任务分配更大预算（如93次rollout），在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，可将饱和任务的探索预算重新分配到最有影响力的任务，相比传统均匀分配节省约2倍计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型微调时的数据选择问题，将其重新表述为预算约束下的优化问题，旨在在有限训练数据预算下最大化模型下游性能。

Method: 将数据选择问题重新表述为可处理的马尔可夫决策过程，使用各种强化学习方法训练智能体学习最优数据选择策略，并通过高效的代理模型奖励信号进行指导。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，使用该方法选择的5%数据子集进行微调，性能匹配或优于全数据集微调，准确率最高提升10.8个百分点，同时训练时间减少2倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习指导的数据选择方法具有巨大潜力，能够在严格数据预算下实现高效的大语言模型微调。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的策略梯度方法（如PPO）通常沿着单一随机梯度方向更新，忽略了参数空间的丰富局部结构。研究发现替代梯度与真实奖励地形相关性差，而更高性能的解往往位于附近未探索区域。

Method: 引入ExploRLer管道，与PPO、TRPO等在线策略算法无缝集成，系统性地探测替代在线策略梯度更新的未探索邻域。

Result: 在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下，ExploRLer在复杂连续控制环境中相比基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为增强在线强化学习提供了一种实用有效的方法，并为替代目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中使用差分隐私保护客户端数据时，添加的噪声会显著降低模型精度，需要解决这一挑战

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型注入高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大

Result: 理论分析表明MS-PAFL显著减少了满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声量，实验验证其实现了优越的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: MS-PAFL能够在强隐私保证下训练高精度模型，有效解决了联邦学习中隐私保护与模型精度之间的权衡问题

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST是一个完全连续可微的稀疏感知训练框架，用于半结构化稀疏模型，通过联合优化稀疏模式和权重，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏感知训练可以将大语言模型转换为硬件友好的稀疏模式，减少推理延迟和内存消耗。现有方法分别优化稀疏模式和权重，效率较低。

Method: CAST包含三个核心组件：AdamS优化器（自适应L1衰减促进均匀稀疏化）、权重缩放模块（缓解衰减导致的幅度减少）、知识蒸馏（使用稠密模型作为自教师）。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，从125M到13B参数的多个模型家族中，CAST在困惑度和零样本准确率上显著优于现有方法。LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅用2%原始预训练token，困惑度仅增加0.09，零样本准确率提升0.36%。

Conclusion: CAST框架能够高效训练半结构化稀疏模型，建立了准确的经验缩放定律来预测稀疏模型性能，并在量化和微调场景中展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非对称actor-critic框架，允许critic在训练时使用任意特权信号而无需访问完整状态，扩展了非对称方法的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非对称actor-critic方法通常假设训练时能访问完整状态，但在实际部分可观测环境中这一假设往往不成立。

Method: 提出了informed asymmetric actor-critic框架，基于核方法和回报预测误差的信息性度量，确保策略梯度无偏。

Result: 在基准导航任务和合成部分可观测环境中的实验验证表明，当有信息丰富的特权输入时，该方法能提高学习效率和价值估计。

Conclusion: 挑战了训练时需要完整状态访问的必要性，为非对称强化学习方法的设计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为间接注意力的新型注意力机制，用于处理键和值来自不同序列或模态时的上下文不对齐问题，相比标准注意力机制具有更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制假设键和值来自相同的底层序列，但在实际应用中，键和值可能来自不同序列或模态，导致上下文不对齐问题，这会显著降低标准注意力机制的效果。

Method: 首先分析了注意力机制在噪声值特征下的行为，建立了关键噪声阈值；然后将上下文不对齐建模为值特征中的结构化噪声；最后提出了间接注意力机制，通过间接推断相关性来处理不对齐场景。

Result: 在合成任务和实际应用中评估了间接注意力的性能，结果表明它能够有效处理上下文不对齐问题，性能优于标准注意力机制。

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制为解决键值不对齐问题提供了一种有效方法，在存在上下文不对齐的场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了FITS系统，使用基于BERT的NLP技术从可信文本中提取和分类时尚品牌可持续发展信息，以解决该领域信息稀缺和难以解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚行业可持续发展信息有限且难以解读，通用语言模型缺乏领域知识且容易产生幻觉，这对事实准确性要求高的领域特别有害。

Method: 基于BERT的语言模型在精心策划的语料库上进行微调，使用领域特定分类模式，通过贝叶斯优化优化超参数，开发了FITS原型系统。

Result: FITS允许用户搜索相关数据、分析自己的数据，并通过交互界面探索信息。在两个潜在用户焦点小组中评估了可用性、视觉设计、内容清晰度等方面。

Conclusion: 领域适应的NLP在促进知情决策方面具有价值，并强调了AI应用在应对气候相关挑战方面的更广泛潜力。该工作还提供了可持续纺织品语料库数据集和更新方法。

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，在重尾数据分布下能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Muon优化器优于Adam的机制，特别是在训练大语言模型时的性能优势，从关联记忆的角度进行分析。

Method: 通过消融实验分析Transformer组件，研究Muon在重尾数据上的优化特性，并建立理论模型分析单层关联记忆在类别不平衡数据下的表现。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据上能更有效地优化尾部类别，理论分析证实Muon能实现跨类别的平衡学习。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，在重尾分布下比Adam能实现更平衡和有效的尾部类别学习。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

TL;DR: DPSBA是一个针对图神经网络分类任务的干净标签后门攻击框架，通过对抗训练学习分布内触发器，有效抑制结构和语义异常，在保持高攻击成功率的同时显著提升隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图分类后门攻击方法存在结构异常（罕见子图触发器）和语义异常（标签翻转）问题，使得中毒图容易被异常检测模型发现，需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 提出DPSBA框架，通过异常感知判别器指导的对抗训练来学习分布内触发器，同时抑制结构异常和语义异常。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，DPSBA在攻击有效性和可检测性之间取得了优越的平衡，相比现有方法具有更高的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: DPSBA通过抑制结构和语义异常，实现了高效且隐蔽的图分类后门攻击，为图神经网络安全性研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来解决时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时最大化泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只预测分类器层，无法调整其他模型组件，限制了泛化能力。而预测完整模型权重又计算成本过高。

Method: 1) 在保持参数相似性的前提下，通过在单个时序域上微调基础模型创建功能多样化的专家模型；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时序权重轨迹，通过自适应平均系数优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置上的实验表明，TEA比现有TDG方法性能提升高达69%，同时效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架通过权重平均有效解决了时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型对未来域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Conclusion: 该框架填补了临床适用性和计算效率之间的差距，证明了在噪声场景中基于领域知识的特征融合优于复杂架构，挑战了模型深度对EEG伪迹检测的普遍依赖。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Motivation: RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力方面表现突出，但容易出现熵崩溃问题，即模型快速收敛到近乎确定性的形式，阻碍探索和长期RL训练的进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究PPO和GRPO中裁剪机制对熵的影响，发现clip-low增加熵而clip-high减少熵，并探索如何通过调整裁剪参数来控制熵。

Result: 在标准裁剪参数下，clip-high效应占主导，导致整体熵减少，即使提供纯随机奖励。通过更激进的clip-low值可以增加熵，促进探索，防止熵崩溃。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，独立于奖励信号影响熵，进而影响推理行为。通过有意识地使用裁剪可以控制熵，防止熵崩溃，促进RLVR训练中的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

Motivation: 智能制造需要满足严格延迟和能耗预算的设备端智能。HDC作为一种轻量级替代方案，通过高维超向量编码数据和简单操作进行计算。但先前研究假设HDC超参数与性能的定性关系在不同应用中稳定，本文验证这一假设是否成立。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，调优后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。未来工作将实现自适应编码器和超参数选择，扩展到更多制造模式验证。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的对齐仍是核心挑战，现有偏好优化方法通常需要在训练时或基于提示进行干预，缺乏推理阶段的直接优化方法

Method: AAD方法在推理时进行隐式奖励优化，只需要标准的DPO训练设置，无需专门训练

Result: AAD在多种对齐基准测试和不同规模模型上均优于强基线方法，在数据受限情况下还能生成高质量合成数据

Conclusion: AAD提供了一种实用的推理时对齐增强方法，特别适用于标注数据有限的情况

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经算子模型依赖全局混合机制（如谱卷积或注意力），这往往会过度平滑尖锐的局部动态并带来高计算成本。

Method: FINO用可学习卷积核替换固定有限差分模板系数，通过显式可学习时间步进方案演化状态。核心局部算子块包含微分模板层、门控掩码和线性融合步骤，构建自适应导数类局部特征。

Result: 在六个基准测试和气候建模任务中，FINO比最先进的算子学习基线实现了高达44%的误差降低和约2倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: 严格局部性与可学习时间步进相结合，为神经PDE求解器提供了准确且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Motivation: 传统HVAC系统在确保室内环境质量的同时往往带来高昂的能源成本，需要一种能够平衡室内环境质量与能源效率的智能管理方法。

Method: 利用从净零能耗学术建筑收集的ROBOD数据集，对LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构进行基准测试，预测CO2浓度、温度和湿度等IEQ参数。

Result: GRU在短期预测中表现最佳且计算开销较低，CNN-LSTM在扩展预测窗口中擅长提取主要特征，LSTM则提供稳健的长程时间建模能力。预测可靠性取决于数据分辨率、传感器位置和变化的占用条件。

Conclusion: 研究结果为智能建筑管理系统实施预测性HVAC控制提供了可行见解，有助于在实际建筑运营中降低能耗并提升居住者舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Marginal Flow的密度建模框架，通过将潜在参数w从可学习的分布中采样并边缘化，克服了现有方法在训练成本、推理速度、似然近似、模式崩溃和架构约束等方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密度建模方法存在训练成本高、推理速度慢、近似似然、模式崩溃或双射映射等架构约束的局限性，需要一种能同时克服这些问题的解决方案。

Method: 定义模型qθ(x)通过参数分布q(x|w)和潜在参数w，不直接优化w，而是通过从可学习分布qθ(w)中采样w来边缘化潜在变量，从而实现高效密度评估和采样。

Result: Marginal Flow允许精确密度评估，在训练和推理阶段都比竞争模型快几个数量级，能够处理低维流形分布、多模态目标，并可使用各种目标函数高效训练。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个简单而强大的框架，在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像潜在空间流形学习等任务中表现出色，克服了现有密度建模方法的多个关键限制。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然能解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂。多阶段训练虽能部分缓解，但过短的初始上下文会导致性能不可逆下降。

Method: 提出TFPI方法，在RLVR中引入ThinkFree操作，通过直接附加</think>标记来显式丢弃思维内容，减少推理时的token使用。

Result: TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到更高性能上限，生成更token高效推理模型。4B模型在AIME24达到89.0%准确率，LiveCodeBench达到65.5%，仅用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是简单有效的RLVR适配方法，能显著降低计算成本并提高性能，无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的锂电镀检测方法，通过直接建模充电-电压关系Q(V)来概率性地推断dQ/dV，解决了传统差分方法放大噪声和引入偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速充电过程中的锂电镀会加速容量衰减并引发安全故障。现有方法依赖带滤波的有限差分计算dQ/dV，会放大传感器噪声并在峰值定位中引入偏差。

Method: 使用高斯过程框架直接建模Q(V)关系，利用GP导数仍是GP的特性，从后验分布中解析地推断dQ/dV，提供噪声感知的推理和不确定性量化。

Result: 在锂离子纽扣电池上验证，涵盖0.2C-1C倍率和0-40°C温度范围，GP方法在低温高倍率充电下可靠检测电镀峰值，在基线情况下正确报告无峰值。

Conclusion: GP识别的微分峰值与降低的充电通量和容量衰减一致，证实了方法的准确性和鲁棒性，为实时锂电镀检测建立了实用途径。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出截断多项式分类器(TPCs)，用于动态监控LLM激活状态，实现按需调整安全监控计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对所有查询使用相同计算量，造成资源浪费或漏检风险。需要灵活的安全监控，仅在困难输入或计算资源充足时增加成本。

Method: TPCs是线性探针的自然扩展，采用多项式训练和逐项评估。支持测试时提前终止进行轻量监控，或在需要时使用更多项提供更强防护。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集上，对4个高达300亿参数的模型测试，TPCs在相同规模下与MLP基线竞争或表现更优，同时比黑盒方法更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供两种使用模式：安全调节器模式和自适应级联模式，能够有效平衡监控成本与安全性，为LLM安全监控提供灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发稳健的统计程序提供了潜在途径，可用于前沿模型评估科学中。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein分布鲁棒性的框架，用于在最坏情况下认证群体公平性，确保在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体公平性指标在重采样和分布偏移下变化剧烈且脆弱，这削弱了可靠审计的能力。

Method: 使用Wasserstein分布鲁棒框架，通过强对偶性推导出可处理的重新表述和高效估计器DRUNE，统一了常见的群体公平性概念。

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准和分类器上提供了在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估，具有可行性、一致性和有限样本认证保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为在观测数据之外审计和认证群体公平性提供了原则性基础，确保在最坏情况下的公平性保证。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Motivation: 现有研究很少探索DRO在解决个体公平性问题中的应用，特别是在考虑因果结构和敏感属性的学习问题中。

Method: 从因果和个体公平性角度构建DRO问题，提出DRO对偶公式，推导近似最坏情况损失的闭式解作为正则化器，并在更一般情况下估计正则化器。

Result: 成功将DRO问题转化为更易处理的形式，消除了min-max问题中的max步骤，并建立了DRO与经典鲁棒优化的关系。

Conclusion: 通过移除已知结构因果模型的假设，提供了使用经验分布和估计因果结构设计DRO时的有限样本误差界，确保了高效和鲁棒的学习。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

Motivation: 传统生成模型依赖高斯去噪，但在PDE和动力系统（如气候）的自回归预测任务中可能不是最有效的选择。研究旨在找到更适合物理系统模拟的生成建模方法。

Method: 使用随机插值方法，直接学习当前状态与未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布的邻近性来构建生成模型。

Result: 随机插值方法比基于高斯噪声传输的模型使用更少的采样步骤，产生更准确的预测，在确定性精度、频谱一致性和概率校准方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 随机插值成为物理模拟的竞争性基准方法，通过调整采样可以平衡不同需求，为不同生成建模框架的能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低数据量模仿学习场景中，传统依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构的方法难以应用，需要更高效的数据利用方法。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练解决，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计。

Result: 在具有挑战性的连续控制任务（包括高维Humanoid任务）上表现优异，在极低数据量下仍能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: NGT提供了一种简单有效、易于实现和调优的模仿学习方法，特别适合低数据量场景。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于自动调优框架中超参数调优的新方法，通过统计评估、数据集共享和仿真模式，显著降低了调优成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优在科学计算中广泛应用，但优化算法的超参数几乎从未被调优过，其潜在性能影响未被研究。

Method: 提出通用超参数调优方法，包括跨搜索空间的稳健统计评估、发布FAIR数据集和软件、以及通过仿真模式重放历史调优数据来降低调优成本。

Result: 有限的超参数调优可将自动调优器性能平均提升94.8%，使用元策略优化超参数可进一步平均提升204.7%。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是被忽视的强大技术，可显著推进自动调优的研究和实践。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段对齐策略，通过NeuroTTT自监督微调范式结合测试时训练，解决EEG基础模型在预训练目标与下游任务之间的不对齐问题，显著提升了脑机接口任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模EEG信号基础模型在脑机接口应用中面临预训练目标与下游任务不对齐、跨被试分布偏移等挑战，需要一种有效的对齐策略来弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出两阶段对齐策略：1) NeuroTTT自监督微调，通过任务相关的自监督目标使潜在表征与EEG的频谱、空间和时间特征对齐；2) 测试时训练，包括对未标记测试样本的自监督训练和预测熵最小化，仅更新归一化统计量来实时校准模型。

Result: 在三个不同的脑机接口任务（想象语音、压力检测、运动想象）上，该方法显著提高了模型的鲁棒性和准确性，达到了最先进的性能水平，超越了传统的微调和适应方法。

Conclusion: 将领域调优的自监督学习与测试时训练相结合的统一方法，能够有效提升大规模EEG基础模型在多样化脑机接口任务中的表现，为解决模型对齐问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的解码策略AGD，通过引导生成过程关注用户定义的关键区域，显著提升LLM的指令遵循能力和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在复杂指令遵循和事实准确性方面表现不佳，现有控制技术又常常降低输出质量，需要一种既能有效控制生成又能保持输出质量的方法。

Method: AGD从高概率候选token中选择对用户定义感兴趣区域(ROI)归因最高的token，ROI可灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件上。还提出了基于熵的自适应变体，在模型不确定时应用引导。

Result: 在指令遵循任务中，Llama 3.1的成功率从66.0%提升到79.1%；在知识密集型任务中，通过引导使用内部知识或上下文源，减少了幻觉并提高了事实准确性。

Conclusion: AGD提供了一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法来增强现代LLM的可靠性，在保持输出质量的同时显著提升了控制效果。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AC-RL方法，通过交互训练视觉模型理解推理系统所需信息，减少澄清需求，提高视觉数学推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述缺乏推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是因为缺少关键视觉信息

Method: 自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过训练过程中的澄清请求揭示信息缺口，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使生成更全面的初始描述

Result: 在7个视觉数学推理基准上平均准确率比预训练基线提高4.4个百分点，分析显示可将澄清请求减少最多39%

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互学习就能有效优化视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，澄清可作为隐式监督形式

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Motivation: 在实际优化场景中，当计算预算充足时，实践者通常希望为单个特定问题找到最佳解决方案，需要尝试多种启发式替代方案。然而，这个问题尚未得到专门综述，相关策略分散在不同研究领域。

Method: 使用统一术语和共同框架解释适合该问题的策略，包括算法选择、参数调优、多启动和资源分配等方法，并开发了一个分类法来系统组织和分类这些策略。

Result: 提出了一个系统化的分类框架，将分散在不同研究领域的单问题多尝试优化策略统一起来，为实践者提供了清晰的方法论指导。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了单问题多尝试启发式优化领域综述的空白，通过统一框架和分类法为相关研究和实践提供了系统化的理论基础。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

Method: 通过100多个对照实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖从LLM预训练到视觉对齐和监控多模态微调的全流程，分析不同数据类别和混合对视觉先验的影响。

Result: 发现推理先验主要来自推理中心数据（如代码、数学、学术文本），具有可转移性和普适性；感知先验则更广泛地来自通用语料，对视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据更敏感。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于数据中心的预训练方法，用于有意识地培养语言预训练中的视觉先验，为下一代多模态LLMs的发展开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法需要大量评估黑盒模型，成本高且不实用，特别是当模型访问受限时

Method: ACE算法结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，优先选择信息量大的点来近似决策边界

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有方法，同时能有效识别最小且可行的特征变化

Conclusion: ACE是一种样本高效的算法，能在减少模型评估次数的同时生成准确可行的反事实解释

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了广义信息瓶颈(GIB)框架，通过协同信息视角重新表述原始信息瓶颈原理，解决了IB的理论模糊性和估计挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息瓶颈(IB)原理为理解神经网络学习提供了理论框架，但存在理论模糊性和估计困难等实际应用限制。

Method: 基于协同信息重新表述IB原理，使用基于平均交互信息的可计算协同定义，构建广义信息瓶颈框架。

Result: GIB在各种架构中始终表现出压缩阶段，在ReLU激活网络中表现优于标准IB，并在CNN和Transformer中产生可解释的动态，与对抗鲁棒性理解更一致。

Conclusion: GIB框架在保持与现有IB理论兼容性的同时，解决了其局限性，提供了更实用的信息瓶颈实现方法。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Muon优化方法在联邦学习中的应用，提出了FedMuon算法来解决直接使用Muon作为本地优化器不收敛的问题，并分析了近似求解LMO对收敛率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon作为一种基于线性最小化预言(LMO)的新优化方法，在训练神经网络时比Adam等自适应方法更快，但直接应用于联邦学习中的FedAvg会导致不收敛问题。

Method: 提出FedMuon算法，通过缓解LMO作为有偏算子的问题，支持近似求解LMO，并分析不同Newton-Schulz迭代次数对收敛的影响。

Result: 实验表明FedMuon能够超越现有的最先进联邦学习方法，且无论Newton-Schulz迭代次数多少都能收敛，求解LMO越准确收敛越快。

Conclusion: FedMuon成功将Muon优化方法应用于联邦学习，解决了收敛性问题，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自改进框架通过记忆与LLM先验的相互增强，有效提升了LLM在序列决策任务中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

TL;DR: 梯度上升的无约束优化方法在机器遗忘中经常失败，原因是遗忘集和保留集之间存在统计依赖性，即使只是简单的相关性也会导致这些方法无法有效执行遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战普遍观点，揭示基于梯度上升的优化方法在机器遗忘中的失败现象，并探究其根本原因——遗忘集与保留集之间的统计依赖性。

Method: 通过经验证据和理论分析，研究随机遗忘集和逻辑回归场景下的梯度下降-上升迭代行为，使用玩具示例展示模型如何陷入次优局部极小值。

Result: 发现梯度上升方法不仅无法收敛到理想的重训练模型，反而可能收敛到比原始模型更差的解，使遗忘过程产生负面效果。

Conclusion: 遗忘集与保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使只是相关性）足以导致基于上升的遗忘方法失败，这一理论见解在复杂神经网络实验中得到证实。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

### [338] [AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26432)
*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了半自回归解码中固定块大小的假设，提出了AdaBlock-dLLM，一种基于语义的自适应块大小调度器，通过调整运行时块大小来提升解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码使用固定块大小存在两个根本限制：延迟解码开销（高置信度令牌被不必要延迟）和过早解码错误（低置信度令牌过早提交）。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，识别波动带区域，提出AdaBlock-dLLM训练免费调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小以对齐语义边界。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 除了推理时优化，希望基于语义的自适应调度方法和置信度分析能启发未来dLLMs的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

*Vincent Grari,Tim Arni,Thibault Laugel,Sylvain Lamprier,James Zou,Marcin Detyniecki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过自然语言问题作为分裂节点，结合LLM反馈和纯度评估，在保持透明度和可解释性的同时达到或超过基于提示的方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险AI应用中，需要透明、可解释和可审计的决策系统。传统决策树只适用于结构化数据，而LLM虽然能处理非结构化文本但缺乏可验证的推理过程。

Method: 提出Agentic Classification Tree (ACT)，将决策树的分裂节点表示为自然语言问题，通过TextGrad的LLM反馈和基于纯度的评估来优化问题设计。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT的性能达到或超过了基于提示的基线方法，同时生成透明可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功将决策树的透明性和可解释性扩展到非结构化文本数据领域，为高风险AI应用提供了可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽零阶项的可和性要求，为强化学习中的Q-learning等算法提供收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多重要强化学习应用中这一条件无法满足，限制了其适用性。

Method: 引入对随机过程增量的新假设，结合零阶项平方可和的条件，证明几乎必然收敛到有界集合。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，首次为带线性函数逼近的Q-learning提供了这些收敛结果。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为更广泛的随机迭代算法提供了收敛性分析工具，特别适用于强化学习领域。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在领域覆盖窄、忽略协变量任务、缺乏统计严谨性、集成困难等问题，需要更全面和严谨的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含100个预测任务的fev-bench基准，开发轻量级fev库支持可复现评估，使用自助法置信区间进行统计严谨的性能聚合。

Result: 在fev-bench上评估了多种预训练、统计和基线模型，报告了基于胜率和技能分数的性能结果。

Conclusion: fev-bench为时间序列预测提供了更全面和严谨的评估基准，识别了未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ是两种改进的向量量化方法，通过将量化视为添加误差向量来保持前向传播的硬分配，同时允许梯度流动，实现端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化中的硬分配会阻断梯度，阻碍端到端训练，需要改进量化方法以支持梯度传播。

Method: DiVeQ将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；SF-DiVeQ则分配到由码字连线构造的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务中，这些方法在多个数据集上相比其他量化方法提升了重建和样本质量。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ能够在不需要辅助损失或温度调度的情况下实现端到端训练，并显著改善量化性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等变神经网络在处理分子和几何数据时具有强归纳偏置，但通常依赖于专门且计算昂贵的张量操作，需要提高计算效率。

Method: 开发了一个框架，将现有张量场网络转换为局部正则化范式，系统比较了不同等变表示的理论复杂度、经验运行时间和预测准确性。

Result: 该框架在保持等变性的同时显著改善了运行时间，并提供了易于集成到标准消息传递神经网络中的实现。

Conclusion: 局部正则化范式为等变神经网络提供了更高效的实现方案，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAT（Entropy After </Think>）的简单信号来检测和防止大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过监控推理过程中的熵变化来自适应分配计算资源，在保持准确性的同时显著减少token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长链推理中表现出改进性能，但存在过度思考的问题——即使已经得出正确答案仍继续修正，造成计算资源的浪费。

Method: 通过在推理过程中添加停止思考标记（</think>）并监控后续token的熵变化，利用指数移动平均的方差阈值作为停止规则，实现自适应计算分配。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法将token使用量减少了13-21%，同时保持准确性不变，在黑盒设置下也保持有效。

Conclusion: EAT提供了一种简单有效的方法来检测和防止模型过度思考，能够更高效地分配计算资源，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算成本。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，通过客户端-服务器不匹配的模型架构和知识蒸馏来解决异构联邦学习中多任务多模态的个性化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能在去中心化环境中训练多个模型，但最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求。现有研究较少关注如何对具有多任务多模态特性的基础模型进行微调和个性化。

Method: TAP方法：（1）利用客户端和服务器之间不匹配的模型架构，在有利于客户端本地任务时选择性进行替换操作；（2）在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，以捕获有益的一般知识而不损害个性化。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，所提出的算法在各种数据集和任务中相比多个基线方法都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: TAP方法有效解决了异构联邦学习中的多任务多模态个性化问题，并提供了服务器模型在模态-任务对架构下的收敛性分析。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Motivation: 随着关键基础设施日益复杂且依赖度增加，电力系统成为网络攻击的诱人目标，特别是缺乏足够防护措施的不稳定性攻击。

Method: 使用监督机器学习模型训练成本效益高的数据驱动方法，通过改进的Prony分析(MPA)检测不稳定性攻击并触发防御机制。

Result: 在IEEE 14总线系统上的概念验证表明，MPA能够有效检测不稳定性攻击并触发防御机制。

Conclusion: 改进的Prony分析是检测电力系统不稳定性攻击并启动防御措施的可行方法，为现有负荷切除系统提供了有效的安全增强方案。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Result: 在合成多任务问题上验证方法有效性，在Inception-v1上应用显示损失核结构与WordNet语义层次对齐。

Conclusion: 损失核是一个实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络内部的数据组织结构。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP是一种针对长上下文LLM的拓扑感知序列并行方法，通过分解现代加速器拓扑和Ring AllGather原语，充分利用通信容量，相比Ring Attention实现了最高3.58倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Ring Attention在长上下文LLM中通信效率低的问题，因为其采用的Ring AllGather原语与现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑不匹配，只能利用有限的通信带宽。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，同时将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，提出TASP方法。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验表明，TASP比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率，最高达到3.58倍加速。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑分解和原语分解，有效利用了现代加速器的通信能力，为长上下文LLM提供了高效的序列并行解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to

Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张度和扩张性的全场测量对于揭示疾病机械生物学驱动因素和开发个性化治疗策略至关重要

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，通过将LLM推理建模为时间过程，将每个推理步骤的奖励与最终结果明确关联，解决现有过程奖励模型中的信用分配模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)要么孤立处理推理步骤而忽略步骤间依赖关系，要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，面临信用分配模糊问题，使下游模型容易受到奖励攻击且性能不佳。

Method: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)，将LLM推理视为导向正确答案的时间过程。每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果关联。通过强制执行条件概率规则，捕获推理步骤间的因果关系，并通过与结果的链接实现精确的中间步骤归因。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习等实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，提供更可靠的跨样本比较。CRM对奖励攻击更鲁棒，在不依赖真实奖励的情况下实现稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过因果建模和精确信用分配解决了现有过程奖励模型的关键限制。

treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

TL;DR: 提出递归自聚合(RSA)方法，结合并行和顺序推理的优势，通过聚合候选推理链的子集来迭代改进解决方案，显著提升大语言模型在推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法要么采用并行推理（多个独立解决方案），要么采用顺序推理（自我优化），但未能充分利用推理链中的丰富信息。RSA旨在结合两者的优势，利用部分正确的中间推理步骤来提升性能。

Method: RSA通过递归方式聚合候选推理链的子集，在每一步中改进解决方案群体，并将其作为下一轮迭代的候选池。该方法还引入了聚合感知的强化学习训练，使模型学会如何组合解决方案。

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上都带来了显著的性能提升。Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507使用RSA后，在AIME-25、HMMT-25、Reasoning Gym、LiveCodeBench-v6和SuperGPQA等基准测试中，性能可与更大的推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1和o3-mini）竞争，并优于纯并行和顺序扩展策略。

Conclusion: RSA是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，能够充分利用推理链中的信息，通过递归聚合机制实现性能的持续改进，为提升大语言模型的推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Motivation: 现有过程监督强化学习方法在分支位置和采样方面存在探索效率低的问题，而高注意力分数的步骤与推理行为相关，这为改进探索策略提供了启发。

Method: 1) 基于高注意力分数选择分支位置；2) 考虑问题难度和历史批次大小的自适应采样策略；3) 为PSRL设计的一步离策略训练流程。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，该方法在性能、采样和训练效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过改进探索策略和训练流程，显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效率和效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: AccidentBench是一个大规模多模态基准测试，结合车辆事故场景和空中/水域安全关键场景，包含约2000个视频和19000个标注问答对，用于评估模型在真实世界安全关键环境中的时空推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型的快速发展需要能够严格评估在安全关键、动态真实世界环境中理解和推理能力的基准测试。现有基准测试在涵盖多样化安全关键场景方面存在不足。

Method: 构建包含车辆事故和空中/水域安全关键场景的大规模数据集，包含不同视频长度（短/中/长）和难度级别（简单/中等/困难），系统性地探测时间、空间和意图理解推理能力。

Result: 对最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）的评估显示，即使在最困难任务和最长视频上，最强模型准确率也仅为约18%，揭示了在真实世界时空和意图推理方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在暴露多模态模型在安全关键场景中的关键缺陷，推动开发更安全、更鲁棒且与真实世界安全挑战更好对齐的模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型易受数据扰动和对抗样本影响，但传统评估需要访问训练测试数据，存在隐私风险。需要在不泄露私有数据集的情况下进行外部验证。

Method: SPATA将每个数据实例投影到离散空间中进行分析和比较，避免数据泄露。生成统计模式表示用于模型鲁棒性评估。

Result: 该方法可以可靠地评估不同特征对ML模型鲁棒性的影响，并生成模型行为的可解释说明。

Conclusion: SPATA有助于提高处理机密数据组织的透明度，为更可信的AI做出贡献。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.
