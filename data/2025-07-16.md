### [1] [CWNet: Causal Wavelet Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10689)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Yubing Lu,Mengen Cai,Zijian Zhang,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWNet是一种基于小波变换和因果推理的低光图像增强方法，通过全局和局部策略优化语义信息和频率恢复，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低光图像增强方法忽略了实例级语义信息和特征特性，CWNet旨在通过因果推理和小波变换解决这些问题。

Method: CWNet采用因果推理视角和小波变换，包括全局度量学习和局部CLIP语义损失，优化频率信息恢复。

Result: 实验表明CWNet在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CWNet通过因果推理和小波变换，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能和精度。

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

### [2] [Integrating Biological Knowledge for Robust Microscopy Image Profiling on De Novo Cell Lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10737)
*Jiayuan Chen,Thai-Hoang Pham,Yuanlong Wang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种整合外部生物知识的新框架，通过解耦扰动特异性和细胞系特异性表征，提升显微镜图像分析模型对新细胞系的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高通量筛选技术在新细胞系中的扰动筛选面临形态和生物异质性挑战，需改进现有方法。

Method: 结合蛋白质相互作用知识图谱和单细胞转录组特征，解耦扰动和细胞系特异性表征，优化预训练策略。

Result: 在RxRx数据库上验证，通过少量样本微调显著提升新细胞系的图像分析性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于表型的药物发现提供了有效工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

### [3] [Auditing Facial Emotion Recognition Datasets for Posed Expressions and Racial Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10755)
*Rina Khan,Catherine Stinson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究审计了两个先进的FER数据集，发现其中许多图像是摆拍的而非自然的，且FER模型对非白人或深色皮肤的人存在偏见，容易错误预测负面情绪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FER算法在自然表情检测中的性能下降问题，以及其对某些种族和肤色的偏见问题。

Method: 随机抽样审计FER数据集，提出区分自然与摆拍图像的方法，并测试模型对不同肤色人群的预测准确性。

Result: 发现数据集中存在大量摆拍图像，且模型对非白人或深色皮肤的人更容易错误预测负面情绪。

Conclusion: FER数据集和模型存在显著偏见，可能在实际应用中造成伤害，需改进数据收集和模型训练方法。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

### [4] [FPC-Net: Revisiting SuperPoint with Descriptor-Free Keypoint Detection via Feature Pyramids and Consistency-Based Implicit Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10770)
*Ionuţ Grigore,Călin-Adrian Popa,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需描述符的兴趣点匹配方法，显著降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖描述符进行兴趣点匹配，计算和存储开销大。

Method: 在检测阶段直接关联兴趣点，避免描述符的使用。

Result: 匹配精度略低于传统方法，但内存使用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为定位系统提供了一种高效的内存优化方案。

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的航天器图像数据集，用于训练实时自主检测系统，并通过微调YOLO模型验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航天器在太空环境中易受损，人工或机器人维修成本高，需要可靠的自主检测系统。现有公开标注数据稀缺。

Method: 创建了包含64k标注图像的航天器数据集，结合真实和合成背景，并添加噪声和失真。微调YOLOv8和YOLOv11模型进行性能测试。

Result: 模型在模拟实时条件下，Dice得分0.92，Hausdorff距离0.69，推理时间约0.5秒。

Conclusion: 数据集和模型为航天器实时图像分割提供了有效解决方案，性能优异。

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

Abstract: Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal
Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM
finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we
present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong
and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the
challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse
scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to
conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given
complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset demonstrate that
our system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as object
retrieval, counting, and distance estimation. The code is available at:

### [7] [ThinkingViT: Matryoshka Thinking Vision Transformer for Elastic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10800)
*Ali Hojjat,Janek Haberer,Soren Pirk,Olaf Landsiedel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkingViT是一种动态调整计算资源的嵌套ViT架构，通过渐进式推理阶段和Token Recycling机制提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有嵌套Transformer模型对所有输入分配相同计算资源导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 引入ThinkingViT，通过渐进式推理阶段动态调整计算资源，并结合Token Recycling机制优化性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，ThinkingViT在相同吞吐量下准确率提升2.0 p.p.，相同计算量下提升2.9 p.p.。

Conclusion: ThinkingViT通过动态计算分配显著提升了效率和性能，可作为现有ViT的插件升级。

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

### [8] [LLM-Guided Agentic Object Detection for Open-World Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10844)
*Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Anoop Cherian,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主目标检测框架（LAOD），实现无需标签的零样本检测，并通过新指标CAAP和SNAP评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测依赖固定类别集，灵活性不足；现有开放世界和开放词汇检测方法各有局限，需提升自主性和适应性。

Method: 利用LLM生成场景特定对象名称，结合开放词汇检测器实现动态目标检测。

Result: 在LVIS、COCO和COCO-OOD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能检测并命名新对象。

Conclusion: LAOD框架提升了开放世界理解的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

### [9] [Winsor-CAM: Human-Tunable Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Layer-Wise Winsorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10846)
*Casey Wall,Longwei Wang,Rodrigue Rizk,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winsor-CAM是一种改进的Grad-CAM方法，通过跨层聚合信息和Winsorization技术生成更鲁棒和可解释的显著性图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释CNN决策过程在高风险领域至关重要，现有方法如Grad-CAM可能掩盖重要语义或放大噪声。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，结合Winsorization技术和用户可调阈值，跨层聚合信息生成显著性图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上，Winsor-CAM在定位指标（如IoU和对齐度）上优于Grad-CAM和均匀层平均基线。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过多层级解释和人工控制，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法难以解释参数更新的贡献，稀疏编码框架旨在解决这一问题，同时提升任务适应能力。

Method: 采用稀疏编码框架，将微调特征表示为特征字典原子的稀疏组合，稀疏系数指示原子重要性。

Result: 在图像编辑和文本到图像概念定制任务中表现优于基线方法，提升了文本对齐和目标概念构建效率。

Conclusion: 稀疏编码框架为模型微调提供了更高的可解释性和性能，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Lennart Svensson,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trexplorer Super是一种改进的3D医学图像中心线追踪模型，解决了重复分支预测和过早终止的问题，并在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确追踪管状树结构（如血管和气道）在医学中至关重要，但现有模型存在重复分支和过早终止的问题。

Method: 提出Trexplorer Super模型，通过新方法改进性能，并开发了三个数据集（一个合成，两个真实）用于评估。

Result: Trexplorer Super在所有数据集上优于现有方法，但合成数据表现不一定适用于真实数据。

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super显著提升了中心线追踪性能，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/RomStriker/Trexplorer-Super.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于CNN的轻量级全球天气预报模型KAI-a，其性能与现有先进模型相当，但计算需求显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的AI天气预测模型取得了显著进展，但其高计算复杂性和资源需求限制了实用性。本文旨在通过现代化CNN架构解决这一问题。

Method: KAI-a采用尺度不变架构和InceptionNeXt模块，结合地球系统数据的特性设计。模型仅含700万参数，使用ERA5数据集训练，单GPU上12小时完成训练。

Result: KAI-a在中期天气预报中表现与先进模型相当，且计算资源需求更低。案例研究显示其对极端事件（如2018年欧洲热浪）的捕捉能力。

Conclusion: KAI-a证明了CNN架构在天气预测中的高效性，为轻量级模型设计提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical
utility.

### [14] [Commuting Distance Regularization for Timescale-Dependent Label Inconsistency in EEG Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10895)
*Xiaocong Zeng,Craig Michoski,Yan Pang,Dongyang Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的正则化策略（LVL和LGCL）来解决EEG情感识别中的时间尺度依赖标签不一致问题，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG情感识别中时间尺度依赖标签不一致（TsDLI）的问题，以提高模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Method: 提出两种正则化策略：局部变化损失（LVL）和局部-全局一致性损失（LGCL），结合有界变差函数和通勤时间距离的数学原理。

Result: 在DREAMER和DEAP数据集上的实验表明，LVL和LGCL优于现有方法，LVL在所有基准模型和指标中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在解决标签不一致问题时，实现了预测性能和可解释性的平衡，LVL和LGCL表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

*Zhengyi Xu,Haoran Wu,Wen Jiang,Jie Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAPL-SCD的图聚合原型学习方法，用于解决语义变化检测中的多任务优化问题，通过自适应权重分配和梯度旋转提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义变化检测（SCD）需要同时优化多个任务，容易因任务间冲突导致负迁移，因此需要一种方法缓解这种冲突。

Method: 设计了多任务联合优化框架，结合语义分割、变化检测和图聚合原型学习任务，采用自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法。

Result: 在SECOND和Landsat-SCD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了SCD任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD通过多任务优化和特征交互模块，有效提升了语义变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

TL;DR: RIDFR是一种基于扩散模型的身份特定人脸修复框架，通过内容注入和身份注入模块，结合对齐学习，显著提升了身份保真度和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸修复技术在视觉质量上有显著进步，但身份不确定性仍未解决，尤其是在身份模糊输入和随机生成过程中。

Method: RIDFR利用预训练扩散模型，结合内容注入模块和身份注入模块，并通过对齐学习抑制与身份无关的语义干扰。

Result: 实验表明，RIDFR在身份保真度和视觉质量上优于现有方法，表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDFR通过创新的模块设计和对齐学习，有效解决了身份不确定性问题，为人脸修复提供了高质量的身份特定结果。

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and
player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis.
Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed
WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

Method: 设计了小波注意力机制的主干网络和射线编码器，分别用于提取多阶交互特征和优化注意力区域。

Result: 在ImageNet和HICO-DET等基准数据集上验证了架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的架构显著提升了HOI检测的效率和准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法未充分解决遮挡问题，且现有方法在遮挡和完整步态之间难以平衡性能。

Method: 将遮挡步态建模为完整步态表示的残差偏差，通过自适应残差学习网络提升遮挡步态识别性能。

Result: 在Gait3D、GREW和BRIAR数据集上验证，RG-Gait显著提升遮挡步态识别性能且不影响完整步态识别。

Conclusion: 残差学习是解决遮挡步态识别并保持完整步态性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

TL;DR: SpaRTAN是一种轻量级架构设计，通过多尺度空间特征捕捉和通道聚合模块提升性能，同时在ImageNet和COCO上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在视觉任务中的简单性偏差和信息冗余问题。

Method: 使用不同感受野的核和波基通道聚合模块，动态整合特征。

Result: ImageNet-1k上77.7%准确率（3.8M参数），COCO上50.0% AP（21.5M参数）。

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计实现了高性能和参数效率。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本异常检测在工业应用中需求广泛，但现有方法存在测试不切实际和噪声干扰问题，FiSeCLIP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合特征匹配与跨模态对齐，利用批次内图像作为参考，并通过文本信息过滤噪声特征，同时恢复CLIP的局部语义相关性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD等基准测试中，FiSeCLIP在异常分类和分割任务上表现优异，超越现有最佳方法AdaCLIP。

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP为零样本异常检测提供了更强基线，展示了CLIP模型在细粒度任务中的潜力。

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR数据集上表现优于同类方法。

Conclusion: SISRNet能有效捕捉细微异常，减轻数据偏差影响，生成临床准确的报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Motivation: 解决传统GAN或扩散模型在医学图像转换中解剖保真度和感知可控性不足的问题。

Method: 采用Schrodinger Bridge框架，结合GAN先验和条件扩散，通过边界一致性和人类反馈（CFG）优化生成过程。

Result: 在临床数据集上表现优异，RMSE、SSIM、LPIPS和Dice指标优于现有方法，且仅需10步采样。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且符合临床偏好，适用于实时医学图像转换。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

Motivation: 现有开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）无法识别用户个性化文本（如“我的马克杯”），导致无法分割用户特定兴趣区域。

Method: 提出了一种基于文本提示调优的插件方法，结合“负掩模提议”减少错误预测，并通过视觉嵌入增强文本提示表示。

Result: 在FSS$^\text{per}$、CUB$^\text{per}$和ADE$^\text{per}$等新基准上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持原始OVSS性能的同时，显著提升了个性化分割能力。

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，DGFDNet实现了最先进的性能，兼具鲁棒性和实时性。

Conclusion: DGFDNet通过双域协同和物理引导，显著提升了去雾效果，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

Conclusion: FootGait3D在临床步态分析、假肢设计和机器人应用中具有重要潜力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学语言引导分割方法依赖成对的图像-文本输入，导致数据利用不足且应用受限。

Method: 提出Prototype-driven Semantic Approximation (PSA)模块，通过原型空间近似语义指导，减少对文本的依赖。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ProLearn在文本有限的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProLearn通过减少文本依赖，扩展了语言引导分割的适用性。

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual
reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG
demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods
when limited text is available.

models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的建模和高质量数据集显著提升了HPE的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Result: 实验表明GKNet在精度和有效性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GKNet和SKD数据集为航天器姿态估计提供了高精度解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at
https://github.com/Dongzhou-1996/GKNet.

Result: 在实地测试中召回率超过98.6%，检测系统可减少约90%的人工工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为RSD自动识别提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Conclusion: 任务感知接触图能有效提升抓取合成的准确性和任务适应性，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助输入和简化物理近似，缺乏标准化3D基准，可能引入不确定性且无法充分捕捉真实辐射传输和大气散射-吸收效应。

Method: 结合WRF和增强的COSP模拟器生成3D散射体积数据，嵌入ATB-BC物理约束到FourCastX网络中，确保能量一致性。

Result: 在Atmos-Bench数据集上，FourCastX在355 nm和532 nm波段均优于现有基准模型。

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench为卫星3D大气结构恢复设定了新标准，有助于更深入的气候研究。

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves
the way for deeper climate insight.

Abstract: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly,
finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to
understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a
growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and
medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development
of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing
research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a
taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy
categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object,
Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent
set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the
requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by
recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize
existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the
interpretability of visual recognition models.

Conclusion: KptLLM++为细粒度图像理解提供了统一解决方案，对提升人机交互具有变革性意义。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Jellyfish, a diverse group of gelatinous marine organisms, play a crucial
role in maintaining marine ecosystems but pose significant challenges for
biodiversity and conservation due to their rapid proliferation and ecological
impact. Accurate identification of jellyfish species is essential for
ecological monitoring and management. In this study, we proposed a deep

techniques, including MobileNetV3, ResNet50, EfficientNetV2-B0, and VGG16,
combined with seven traditional machine learning classifiers and three
Feedforward Neural Network classifiers for precise species identification.
Additionally, we activated the softmax function to directly classify jellyfish
species using the convolutional neural network models. The combination of the
Artificial Neural Network with MobileNetV3 is our best-performing model,
achieving an exceptional accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming other
feature extractor-classifier combinations. This study demonstrates the efficacy
of deep learning and hybrid frameworks in addressing biodiversity challenges
and advancing species detection in marine environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态引导的硬样本生成与学习框架（HSGL），通过结合文本和视觉模态来定义、生成和优化硬样本，提升了服装变化行人重识别（CC-ReID）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬样本在行人重识别任务中具有挑战性，尤其是在服装变化的情况下。其模糊性和缺乏明确定义限制了学习策略的设计和模型的鲁棒性。

Method: HSGL框架包含两个核心组件：双粒度硬样本生成（DGHSG）和硬样本自适应学习（HSAL）。DGHSG利用多模态线索生成语义一致的硬样本，HSAL则通过硬度感知优化策略调整特征距离。

Result: 实验表明，HSGL在多个CC-ReID基准测试中表现优异，显著加速了学习过程，并在PRCC和LTCC数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HSGL框架通过多模态引导的硬样本生成和学习，有效提升了CC-ReID任务的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMOne提供了一种紧凑高效的多模态场景表示方法，解决了模态冲突问题。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,
Nepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our
proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural
image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their
competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long
video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to
expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long
video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

Conclusion: 该方法为连续敏感属性的公平性评估提供了新思路，适用于工业部署。

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

Result: 在3D视觉定位数据集上表现优异，尤其在需要精确空间区分的复杂查询中。

Conclusion: ViewSRD通过结构化多视角分解有效提升3D视觉定位性能。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth
stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616
high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation
annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a

Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to

reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial

This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk

Result: 实验证明框架有效，能实现高精度的表面重建。

Conclusion: 多基元高斯泼溅框架显著提升了表面重建质量。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet通过结合单目深度和多视角几何，显著提升了MVS在挑战区域的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 论文为无约束的真实用户生成视频环境中的多模态字幕任务提供了高质量基准和高效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Motivation: 高分辨率大视场图像的压缩需求增加，传统方法细节保留不足，数据驱动方法泛化性有限。

Result: 在医学图像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，压缩比特率显著降低，训练速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: COLI为大规模图像压缩提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

Motivation: 解决在退化成像条件下鲁棒的圆检测与拟合这一基础计算机视觉挑战。

Method: 结合组合边缘像素采样和卷积参数空间密度估计的3C-FBI算法。

Result: 在真实医学数据、合成数据和不同分辨率/噪声水平下，3C-FBI实现了高精度（Jaccard指数0.896）和实时性能（40.3 fps），优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 3C-FBI在精度、速度和鲁棒性上的优异表现，使其适用于医疗影像、机器人和工业检测等挑战性场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust
circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present
Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an
algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric
fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于人类感知的模糊颜色模型COLIBRI，旨在弥合计算机颜色表示与人类视觉感知之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机难以模仿人类颜色感知，而颜色在人类与环境的互动中至关重要。

Method: 采用模糊集和逻辑构建颜色分类框架，通过三阶段实验（初步实验、大规模人类分类调查）提取模糊分区和生成隶属函数。

Result: 模型与传统颜色模型（如RGB、HSV、LAB）相比更符合人类感知。

Conclusion: COLIBRI模型在设计、人工智能、市场营销和人机交互等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic
alignment and image quality.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成一致内容时，无法保持背景细节和角色一致性，限制了实际应用。

Result: CharaConsist能生成高质量视觉输出，支持连续或离散场景中的角色一致性。

Conclusion: CharaConsist是首个针对DiT模型的文本到图像一致性生成方法，扩展了实际应用范围。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research
and applications.

Motivation: 动态运动基元（DMPs）在捕捉复杂周期性行为和任务间插值方面存在局限性，限制了其实际应用范围。

Method: 引入OSMPs框架，结合学习的微分同胚编码器和超临界Hopf分岔，通过任务条件化编码器实现多运动目标的表示和零样本泛化。

Result: 在多种机器人平台上验证了OSMPs的优越性，性能超越现有基线方法（如扩散策略）。

Conclusion: OSMPs为周期性运动学习提供了稳定且高效的解决方案，扩展了机器人任务的应用范围。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring
complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with
fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability
and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic
behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between
different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,
excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and
rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion
Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder
with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate
acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal
guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by
conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned
policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot
generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We
validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world
experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative
arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot -
demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models represent a transformative shift in
robotics, with the aim of unifying visual perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied control within a single learning framework. This
review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA
paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and
instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26
foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the
development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into
key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for
integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational
datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity,
variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of
their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a
two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based
on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in
the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their
effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to
facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of
supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize
ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable
pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal
alignment strategies. This review serves as both a technical reference and a
conceptual roadmap for advancing embodiment and robotic control, providing
insights that span from dataset generation to real world deployment of

Abstract: Passive deformation due to compliance is a commonly used benefit of soft
robots, providing opportunities to achieve robust actuation with few active
degrees of freedom. Soft growing robots in particular have shown promise in
navigation of unstructured environments due to their passive deformation. If
their collisions and subsequent deformations can be better understood, soft
robots could be used to understand the structure of the environment from direct
tactile measurements. In this work, we propose the use of soft growing robots
as mapping and exploration tools. We do this by first characterizing collision
behavior during discrete turns, then leveraging this model to develop a
geometry-based simulator that models robot trajectories in 2D environments.
Finally, we demonstrate the model and simulator validity by mapping unknown
environments using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the optimal next deployment
given current knowledge. Over both uniform and non-uniform environments, this
selection method rapidly approaches ideal actions, showing the potential for
soft growing robots in unstructured environment exploration and mapping.

Conclusion: RCG框架生成的行为更真实且细致，能更有效地进行压力测试。

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are essential for training and evaluating
autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet remain extremely rare in real-world
driving datasets. To address this, we propose Real-world Crash Grounding (RCG),
a scenario generation framework that integrates crash-informed semantics into
adversarial perturbation pipelines. We construct a safety-aware behavior
representation through contrastive pre-training on large-scale driving logs,
followed by fine-tuning on a small, crash-rich dataset with approximate
trajectory annotations extracted from video. This embedding captures semantic
structure aligned with real-world accident behaviors and supports selection of
adversary trajectories that are both high-risk and behaviorally realistic. We
incorporate the resulting selection mechanism into two prior scenario
generation pipelines, replacing their handcrafted scoring objectives with an
embedding-based criterion. Experimental results show that ego agents trained
against these generated scenarios achieve consistently higher downstream
success rates, with an average improvement of 9.2% across seven evaluation
settings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses further demonstrate that our
approach produces more plausible and nuanced adversary behaviors, enabling more
effective and realistic stress testing of AD systems. Code and tools will be
released publicly.

Conclusion: rt-RISeg通过交互和动态特征实现了高效未见物体分割，展示了交互感知在机器人任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合预训练模型和目标条件强化学习，显著提升了机器人抓取的通用性和效率。

Abstract: General-purpose robotic manipulation, including reach and grasp, is essential
for deployment into households and workspaces involving diverse and evolving
tasks. Recent advances propose using large pre-trained models, such as Large
Language Models and object detectors, to boost robotic perception in
reinforcement learning. These models, trained on large datasets via
self-supervised learning, can process text prompts and identify diverse objects
in scenes, an invaluable skill in RL where learning object interaction is
resource-intensive. This study demonstrates how to integrate such models into
Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning to enable general and versatile robotic
reach and grasp capabilities. We use a pre-trained object detection model to
enable the agent to identify the object from a text prompt and generate a mask
for goal conditioning. Mask-based goal conditioning provides object-agnostic
cues, improving feature sharing and generalization. The effectiveness of the
proposed framework is demonstrated in a simulated reach-and-grasp task, where
the mask-based goal conditioning consistently maintains a $\sim$90\% success
rate in grasping both in and out-of-distribution objects, while also ensuring
faster convergence to higher returns.

Conclusion: GCS中的SWP为机器人学中的混合规划问题提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the Shortest-Walk Problem (SWP) in a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS). A
GCS is a graph where each vertex is paired with a convex program, and each edge
couples adjacent programs via additional costs and constraints. A walk in a GCS
is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where vertices may be repeated.
The length of a walk is given by the cumulative optimal value of the
corresponding convex programs. To solve the SWP in GCS, we first synthesize a
piecewise-quadratic lower bound on the problem's cost-to-go function using
semidefinite programming. Then we use this lower bound to guide an
incremental-search algorithm that yields an approximate shortest walk. We show
that the SWP in GCS is a natural language for many mixed discrete-continuous
planning problems in robotics, unifying problems that typically require
specialized solutions while delivering high performance and computational
efficiency. We demonstrate this through experiments in collision-free motion
planning, skill chaining, and optimal control of hybrid systems.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了基于模仿学习的移动机械臂系统的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imitation learning for mobile manipulation is a key challenge in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, current mobile manipulation frameworks typically
decouple navigation and manipulation, executing manipulation only after
reaching a certain location. This can lead to performance degradation when
navigation is imprecise, especially due to misalignment in approach angles. To
enable a mobile manipulator to perform the same task from diverse orientations,
an essential capability for building general-purpose robotic models, we propose
an object-centric method based on SAM2, a foundation model towards solving
promptable visual segmentation in images, which incorporates manipulation
orientation information into our model. Our approach enables consistent
understanding of the same task from different orientations. We deploy the model
on a custom-built mobile manipulator and evaluate it on a pick-and-place task
under varied orientation angles. Compared to Action Chunking Transformer, our
model maintains superior generalization when trained with demonstrations from
varied approach angles. This work significantly enhances the generalization and
robustness of imitation learning-based mobile manipulation systems.

Motivation: 研究在动态、策略类和目标函数均随时间变化的单轨迹环境中，如何在线调整机器人控制器参数，以解决传统自适应控制和模型无关强化学习的局限性。

Method: 提出M-GAPS算法，结合四旋翼状态空间和策略类的重新参数化，优化单轨迹模型在线策略优化。

Result: M-GAPS在硬件实验中比基线方法更快找到接近最优参数，尤其在不利条件下表现突出，并能快速适应未建模的干扰。

Conclusion: M-GAPS展示了在线策略优化的硬件实用性，比传统方法更灵活、稳定且高效。

Abstract: We study online algorithms to tune the parameters of a robot controller in a
setting where the dynamics, policy class, and optimality objective are all
time-varying. The system follows a single trajectory without episodes or state
resets, and the time-varying information is not known in advance. Focusing on
nonlinear geometric quadrotor controllers as a test case, we propose a
practical implementation of a single-trajectory model-based online policy
optimization algorithm, M-GAPS,along with reparameterizations of the quadrotor
state space and policy class to improve the optimization landscape. In hardware
experiments,we compare to model-based and model-free baselines that impose
artificial episodes. We show that M-GAPS finds near-optimal parameters more
quickly, especially when the episode length is not favorable. We also show that
M-GAPS rapidly adapts to heavy unmodeled wind and payload disturbances, and
achieves similar strong improvement on a 1:6-scale Ackermann-steered car. Our
results demonstrate the hardware practicality of this emerging class of online
policy optimization that offers significantly more flexibility than classic
adaptive control, while being more stable and data-efficient than model-free
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 通过建立可微系统公式，分析磁驱动下的平衡适定性和诱导构型几何，优化MeSCRs的运动性能。

Method: 基于扩展伪刚体模型建立可微系统，结合微分几何开发结构优化框架，优化磁体配置。

Result: 最大可控自由度等于嵌入磁体数量的两倍；优化条件表明需调制构型空间度量谱以提升局部性能。

Conclusion: 仿真验证了框架的有效性，为MeSCRs设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling and optimization framework to enhance
the kinematic performance of multi-magnet embedded soft continuum robots
(MeSCRs). To this end, we establish a differentiable system formulation based
on an extended pseudo-rigid-body model. This formulation enables analysis of
the equilibrium well-posedness and the geometry of the induced configuration
under magnetic actuation. In particular, we show that the maximum controllable
degrees of freedom of a MeSCR equal twice the number of embedded magnets. We
subsequently develop a structural optimization framework based on differential
geometry that links classical kinematic measures (e.g., manipulability and
dexterity) to the configuration of embedded magnets. The resulting optimization
condition reveals that improving local performance requires structurally
modulating the spectrum of the configuration space metric to counteract its
distortion. Closed-form solutions for optimal magnet configurations are derived
under representative conditions, and a gradient-based numerical method is
proposed for general design scenarios. Simulation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于改进社交机器人在多用户环境中的决策能力，包括两种新的损失函数和一个新的多用户HRI数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户交互中，机器人需要理解上下文并决定何时及对谁做出响应，而现有研究主要关注单用户交互。

Method: 采用Transformer多任务学习框架，提出两种新损失函数：一种用于改进场景建模，另一种用于引导响应选择。构建了一个新的多用户HRI数据集。

Result: 模型在响应决策上达到最先进性能，优于现有启发式和单任务方法。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于开发具有社交智能的机器人，能够进行自然且上下文感知的多用户交互。

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决peg-in-hole任务中从少量演示中训练出的策略在空间泛化上的鲁棒性问题。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的框架和原则（顺应性、局部策略和诱导等变性）有效实现了空间泛化的接触密集型策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies
for contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task
configurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the
policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of
demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a
high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)
and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,
G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically
consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB
images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these
design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is
SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key
components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,
localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH
tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to
unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and
principles. The experimental videos can be found on the project website:

Method: 采用基于格点的运动规划器，优化成本项并引入速度启发式，以应对强制并道的独特挑战。

Result: 在数百种高速并道场景的高保真模拟中，成功率达100%，并道时间最短。

Conclusion: SMART-Merge能可靠处理复杂强制并道任务，为自动驾驶提供稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Merging onto a highway is a complex driving task that requires identifying a
safe gap, adjusting speed, often interactions to create a merging gap, and
completing the merge maneuver within a limited time window while maintaining
safety and driving comfort. In this paper, we introduce a Safe Merging and
Real-Time Merge (SMART-Merge) planner, a lattice-based motion planner designed
to facilitate safe and comfortable forced merging. By deliberately adapting
cost terms to the unique challenges of forced merging and introducing a desired
speed heuristic, SMART-Merge planner enables the ego vehicle to merge
successfully while minimizing the merge time. We verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed merge planner through high-fidelity CarMaker
simulations on hundreds of highway merge scenarios. Our proposed planner
achieves the success rate of 100% as well as completes the merge maneuver in
the shortest amount of time compared with the baselines, demonstrating our
planner's capability to handle complex forced merge tasks and provide a
reliable and robust solution for autonomous highway merge. The simulation

Abstract: Vision-based underwater robots can be useful in inspecting and exploring
confined spaces where traditional sensors and preplanned paths cannot be
followed. Sensor noise and situational change can cause significant uncertainty
in environmental representation. Thus, this paper explores how to represent
mapping inconsistency in vision-based sensing and incorporate depth estimation
confidence into the mapping framework. The scene depth and the confidence are
estimated using the RAFT-Stereo model and are integrated into a voxel-based
mapping framework, Voxblox. Improvements in the existing Voxblox weight
calculation and update mechanism are also proposed. Finally, a qualitative
analysis of the proposed method is performed in a confined pool and in a pier
in the Trondheim fjord. Experiments using an underwater robot demonstrated the
change in uncertainty in the visualization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为逆逻辑约束学习（ILCL）的新方法，通过遗传算法和逻辑约束强化学习的博弈，高效学习时间约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从演示中学习时间约束的问题，以重现类似演示的逻辑约束行为。

Method: ILCL方法包括遗传算法的时间逻辑挖掘（GA-TL-Mining）和逻辑约束强化学习（Logic-CRL），前者构建参数化截断线性时间逻辑（TLTL），后者在约束下优化策略。

Result: ILCL在四个时间约束任务中优于现有方法，并成功迁移到真实世界任务（如浅孔插钉）。

Conclusion: ILCL是一种高效的时间约束学习方法，适用于复杂任务和真实世界应用。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of temporal-constraint learning from
demonstrations to reproduce demonstration-like logic-constrained behaviors.
Learning logic constraints is challenging due to the combinatorially large
space of possible specifications and the ill-posed nature of non-Markovian
constraints. To figure it out, we introduce a novel temporal-constraint
learning method, which we call inverse logic-constraint learning (ILCL). Our
method frames ICL as a two-player zero-sum game between 1) a genetic
algorithm-based temporal-logic mining (GA-TL-Mining) and 2) logic-constrained
reinforcement learning (Logic-CRL). GA-TL-Mining efficiently constructs syntax
trees for parameterized truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL) without
predefined templates. Subsequently, Logic-CRL finds a policy that maximizes
task rewards under the constructed TLTL constraints via a novel constraint
redistribution scheme. Our evaluations show ILCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in learning and transferring TL constraints on four temporally
constrained tasks. We also demonstrate successful transfer to real-world
peg-in-shallow-hole tasks.

Motivation: 传统导航系统在动态和非结构化环境中表现不佳，强化学习方法因泛化能力差和模拟多样性不足而难以实际应用。

Conclusion: LE-Nav通过场景感知和自适应调参，显著提升了导航性能和社会接受度，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

Abstract: This study presents an advanced approach to enhance robotic manipulation in
uncertain and challenging environments, with a focus on autonomous operations
augmented by human-in-the-loop (HITL) control for lunar missions. By
integrating human decision-making with autonomous robotic functions, the
research improves task reliability and efficiency for space applications. The
key task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using
an extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time
feedback for precision. The manipulator relays position and force-torque data,
enabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To
mitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,
efficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human
control that allows operators to intervene in ambiguous scenarios. Digital twin
simulation enhances system robustness by enabling continuous feedback,
iterative task refinement, and seamless integration with the deployment
pipeline. The system has been tested to validate its performance in simulated
lunar conditions and ensure reliability in extreme lighting, variable terrain,
changing payloads, and sensor limitations.

Result: 在合成和真实场景中，TRAN-D比现有方法平均绝对误差降低39%，单图像更新时精度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: TRAN-D在透明物体重建中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body
systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find
many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots,
and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only
requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control
forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of
the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the
existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight
into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body
systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.

Abstract: Diagnostic activities, such as ultrasound scans and palpation, are relatively
low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems
and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone
activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic
solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and
reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound
scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body,
which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue
biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a
robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials,
including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept
demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The
measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone
specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a
high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's
accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the
potential use of robots for such clinical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based robust feedback
linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important
family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is
given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our
approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on
Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added
to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the
nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty,
we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed
based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high
probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a
desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of
freedom planar robot.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel coarse-to-fine motion planning framework for
robotic manipulation in cluttered, unmodeled environments. The system
integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model
predictive control (MPC) scheme. Initially, the planner generates feasible
global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data
are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are
progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven
exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables
efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates
closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a
multi-arm platform validate its robustness and adaptability under uncertainties

Abstract: Physically reduced-scale vehicles are emerging to accelerate the development
of advanced automated driving functions. In this paper, we investigate the
effects of scaling on self-localization accuracy with visual and
visual-inertial algorithms using cameras and an inertial measurement unit
(IMU). For this purpose, ROS2-compatible visual and visual-inertial algorithms
are selected, and datasets are chosen as a baseline for real-sized vehicles. A
test drive is conducted to record data of reduced-scale vehicles. We compare
the selected localization algorithms, OpenVINS, VINS-Fusion, and RTAB-Map, in
terms of their pose accuracy against the ground-truth and against data from
real-sized vehicles. When comparing the implementation of the selected
localization algorithms to real-sized vehicles, OpenVINS has the lowest average
localization error. Although all selected localization algorithms have
overlapping error ranges, OpenVINS also performs best when applied to a
reduced-scale vehicle. When reduced-scale vehicles were compared to real-sized
vehicles, minor differences were found in translational vehicle motion
estimation accuracy. However, no significant differences were found when
comparing the estimation accuracy of rotational vehicle motion, allowing RSVRs
to be used as testing platforms for self-localization algorithms.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected public health, healthcare
systems, and daily life, especially amid resource shortages and limited
workers. This crisis has underscored the urgent need for automation in hospital
environments, particularly disinfection, which is crucial to controlling virus
transmission and improving the safety of healthcare personnel and patients.
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection, known for its high efficiency, has been
widely adopted in hospital settings. However, most existing research focuses on
maximizing UV coverage while paying little attention to the impact of human
activity on virus distribution. To address this issue, we propose a mobile
robotic system for UV disinfection focusing on the virus hotspot. The system
prioritizes disinfection in high-risk areas and employs an approach for
optimized UV dosage to ensure that all surfaces receive an adequate level of UV
exposure while significantly reducing disinfection time. It not only improves
disinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk
areas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same
disinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%,
respectively. The video of the experiment is available at:

Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion-augmented reinforcement learning (RL)
approach for robust autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control, addressing key
challenges in underwater trajectory planning and dynamic environment
adaptation. The proposed method integrates three core innovations: (1) A
diffusion-based trajectory generation framework that produces physically
feasible multi-step trajectories, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding
mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions
through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving
long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that
synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the
diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects
optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability
in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating
the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional
control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced
adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in the underwater tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的视频与动作联合预测框架，显著提高了双手机器人操作的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双手机器人操作在工业和家庭服务中至关重要，但高维动作空间和复杂协调需求带来了挑战，视频预测的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 采用多帧潜在预测策略和单向注意力机制，联合优化视频与动作预测，推理时无需视频预测以提高效率。

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，成功率显著提升，ALOHA提高24.9%，RoboTwin提高11.1%，真实实验提高32.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了双手机器人协调问题，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in
industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant
challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination
requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for
representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich
dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual
coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action
prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy
that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving
task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention
mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action
prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to
omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency.
Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a
significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using
our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%}
increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅依赖视觉的飞行控制方法，使用事件相机和神经网络替代传统惯性传感器，实现了无人机的稳定飞行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多飞行生物依赖视觉而非重力感知进行姿态控制，而飞行机器人通常依赖惯性传感器。本研究旨在探索仅依赖视觉的飞行控制方法。

Method: 使用下视事件相机和循环卷积神经网络，通过监督学习训练，从事件流中估计姿态和旋转速率。

Result: 实验证明该方法可替代传统惯性测量单元，实现稳定飞行，并研究了网络在不同环境中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉飞行控制是未来昆虫级飞行机器人自主飞行的有潜力方案。

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

Abstract: Robotic task execution faces challenges due to the inconsistency between

anytime UCT-like Monte Carlo planner (UPOM). We implement RAE+UPOM on a mobile
manipulator in a real-world deployment for an object collection task. Our
experiments demonstrate robust task execution under action failures and sensor
noise, and provide empirical insights into the interleaved acting-and-planning
decision making process.

Motivation: 现有的RoboCup Logistics League专注于生产物流，但未能反映智能制造的近期发展，导致其相关性下降。

Method: 设计新的RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League，包含多个独立但逐步整合的赛道，覆盖工业机器人挑战、人机协作等。

Result: 预期新竞赛将更具吸引力，并聚焦工业机器人的当前和未来挑战。

Conclusion: 新竞赛将提升RoboCup在智能制造领域的相关性和影响力。

Abstract: The RoboCup Logistics League is a RoboCup competition in a smart factory
scenario that has focused on task planning, job scheduling, and multi-agent
coordination. The focus on production logistics allowed teams to develop highly
competitive strategies, but also meant that some recent developments in the
context of smart manufacturing are not reflected in the competition, weakening
its relevance over the years. In this paper, we describe the vision for the
RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League, a new competition designed as a larger
smart manufacturing scenario, reflecting all the major aspects of a modern
factory. It will consist of several tracks that are initially independent but
gradually combined into one smart manufacturing scenario. The new tracks will
cover industrial robotics challenges such as assembly, human-robot
collaboration, and humanoid robotics, but also retain a focus on production
logistics. We expect the reenvisioned competition to be more attractive to
newcomers and well-tried teams, while also shifting the focus to current and
future challenges of industrial robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a state-estimation solution for legged robots that uses a
set of low-cost, compact, and lightweight sensors to achieve low-drift pose and
velocity estimation under challenging locomotion conditions. The key idea is to
leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to
correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the
inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended
Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera
data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a
visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through
comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using
real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion
tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in
scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body
rotations. A C++ implementation, along with a large-scale dataset, is available

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration in surgery represents a significant area of
research, driven by the increasing capability of autonomous robotic systems to
assist surgeons in complex procedures. This systematic review examines the
advancements and persistent challenges in the development of autonomous
surgical robotic assistants (ASARs), focusing specifically on scenarios where
robots provide meaningful and active support to human surgeons. Adhering to the
PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across the
IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, resulting in the selection
of 32 studies for detailed analysis. Two primary collaborative setups were
identified: teleoperation-based assistance and direct hands-on interaction. The
findings reveal a growing research emphasis on ASARs, with predominant
applications currently in endoscope guidance, alongside emerging progress in
autonomous tool manipulation. Several key challenges hinder wider adoption,
including the alignment of robotic actions with human surgeon preferences, the
necessity for procedural awareness within autonomous systems, the establishment
of seamless human-robot information exchange, and the complexities of skill
acquisition in shared workspaces. This review synthesizes current trends,
identifies critical limitations, and outlines future research directions
essential to improve the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of human-robot

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在已知环境中的点对点导航问题，同时避免碰撞和死锁，适应动态环境和异步目标更新。

Method: 采用分层框架：1) 集中式离散路径规划器（基于MAPF）；2) 分散式连续轨迹控制器。结合LaCAM和Freyja实现。

Result: 展示了15架真实多旋翼机器人的动态导航能力，适应随机目标更新和动态障碍物（如行人）。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态环境中表现出鲁棒性和可扩展性，适用于多机器人系统的长期导航任务。

Abstract: We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation
tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and
versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous
and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick
replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations,
including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target
updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and
locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains, such as music performance,
remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique
challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb
coordination over pieces lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot
Drummer, a humanoid system capable of expressive, high-precision drumming
across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as
sequential fulfillment of timed-contacts and transform drum scores in to a
Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical
performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a
single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz
tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high
F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming
strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive sticks assignments,
demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots
into the domain of creative musical performance. Project page:

Result: 在Llama 3.2 11B和Gemma 3 12B上，分类准确率超过60%，能有效区分歧义与非歧义指令。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了手术中人机协作的安全性和可靠性，可提前识别潜在歧义指令。

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in
safety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as
surgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative
surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each
configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,
contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator
is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential
issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal
prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled
calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed
classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from
unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and
reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to
identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.

Motivation: 传统TTTM方法依赖静态配置数据或黄金参考，难以在商业生产线中实现，且不适用于异构设备环境。

Method: 提出基于数据方差和模式数量的新型TTTM分析流程，包括单变量和多变量方法。

Result: 最佳单变量方法在方差和模式数量上的相关系数分别超过0.95和0.5；多变量方法与最佳单变量方法的相关系数超过0.75。

Conclusion: 新方法在工具间匹配中表现有效，尤其在异构设备环境中，同时对算法超参数敏感。

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber
matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional
TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden
reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line.
Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting,
where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different
equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these
issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance
and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves
a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes,
respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best
multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the
top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we
analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm
hyper-parameters.

Motivation: 改进标准交叉熵损失函数，以提升分类任务中优化过程的效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet模型验证，分类准确率优于标准交叉熵损失函数。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持简单性的同时提升了性能，为损失函数设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function. This is a novel
measure derived from the information theory. In comparison to the standard
cross entropy loss function, the proposed one has an additional term that
depends on the predicted probability of the true class. This feature serves to
enhance the optimization process in classification tasks involving one-hot
encoded class labels. The proposed one has been evaluated on a ResNet-based
model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Preliminary results show that the proposed
one consistently outperforms the standard cross entropy loss function in terms
of classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed one maintains simplicity,
achieving practically the same efficiency to the traditional cross entropy
loss. These findings suggest that our approach could broaden the scope for

Motivation: 预定义和自适应学习率调度器可能导致次优泛化，需更有效的动态调整方法。

Method: 基于随机过程波动性概念，计算长短期准确率波动比，动态调整学习率。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，VolSched显著提升ResNet-18和ResNet-34的准确率，并找到更平坦的极值点。

Conclusion: VolSched通过动态学习率调整，有效提升模型泛化性能。

Abstract: Effective learning rate (LR) scheduling is crucial for training deep neural
networks. However, popular pre-defined and adaptive schedulers can still lead
to suboptimal generalization. This paper introduces VolSched, a novel adaptive
LR scheduler inspired by the concept of volatility in stochastic processes like
Geometric Brownian Motion to dynamically adjust the learning rate. By
calculating the ratio between long-term and short-term accuracy volatility,
VolSched increases the LR to escape plateaus and decreases it to stabilize
training, allowing the model to explore the loss landscape more effectively. We
evaluate VolSched on the CIFAR-100 dataset against a strong baseline using a
standard augmentation pipeline. When paired with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, our
scheduler delivers consistent performance gains, improving top-1 accuracy by
1.4 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. Analysis of the loss curves reveals
that VolSched promotes a longer exploration phase. A quantitative analysis of
the Hessian shows that VolSched finds a final solution that is 38% flatter than
the next-best baseline, allowing the model to obtain wider minima and hence
better generalization performance.

Result: 证明了单层Transformer（包含一个自注意力层和一个ReLU激活的前馈网络）可以逼近任何连续序列到序列的映射。

Conclusion: 研究结果推动了Transformer模型的理论理解，并帮助缩小理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Deep learning employs multi-layer neural networks trained via the
backpropagation algorithm. This approach has achieved success across many
domains and relies on adaptive gradient methods such as the Adam optimizer.
Sequence modeling evolved from recurrent neural networks to attention-based
models, culminating in the Transformer architecture. Transformers have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (for example, BERT
and GPT-3) and have been applied in computer vision and computational biology.
However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this
paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and
Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts
from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning,
and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation
algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem
for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one
self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU
activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a
compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a
complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical
implications of this result. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding
of Transformer models and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Conclusion: MH-FSF框架为特征选择方法提供了统一比较平台，推动了方法学一致性和严谨性，为Android恶意软件检测等领域开辟了新研究方向。

Abstract: Feature selection is vital for building effective predictive models, as it
reduces dimensionality and emphasizes key features. However, current research
often suffers from limited benchmarking and reliance on proprietary datasets.
This severely hinders reproducibility and can negatively impact overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce the MH-FSF framework, a
comprehensive, modular, and extensible platform designed to facilitate the
reproduction and implementation of feature selection methods. Developed through
collaborative research, MH-FSF provides implementations of 17 methods (11
classical, 6 domain-specific) and enables systematic evaluation on 10 publicly
available Android malware datasets. Our results reveal performance variations
across both balanced and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the critical need
for data preprocessing and selection criteria that account for these
asymmetries. We demonstrate the importance of a unified platform for comparing
diverse feature selection techniques, fostering methodological consistency and
rigor. By providing this framework, we aim to significantly broaden the
existing literature and pave the way for new research directions in feature
selection, particularly within the context of Android malware detection.

Motivation: 在线学习中，混合类型特征、数据漂移和标签缺失是三大挑战，传统方法难以应对。

Method: OL-MDISF通过构建潜在copula表示、检测漂移和结构感知伪标记来解决这些问题。

Result: 在14个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两种漂移场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: OL-MDISF为复杂、弱监督的流数据学习提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible
learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still
faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data
streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric
modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an
abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often
infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To
address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed,
Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent
copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via
ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware
pseudo-labeling.
  This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF.
It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling,
drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of
experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios.
These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal
ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for

Motivation: 属性缺失图的深度图聚类在实际应用中至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用节点邻域信息，导致结果不可靠。

Method: DTRGC方法包括动态聚类感知特征传播（DCFP）、分层邻域感知填补（HNAI）和多跳表示增强（HRE），通过分层填补和聚类结构优化填补结果。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的图数据集上，DTRGC显著提升了属性缺失图下多种DGC方法的聚类性能。

Conclusion: DTRGC通过分层填补和聚类信息修正，有效解决了属性缺失图的深度图聚类问题，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised
task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct
clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical
applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing
imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the
varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to
unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood.
To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph
Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known
neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to
iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering
information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware
Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting
propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,
Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing
nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood
attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups
with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster
structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.
Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information
across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node
representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show
that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC
methods under attribute-missing graphs.

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking
services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant
challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement.
Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential
solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only
encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios
but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these
challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the
performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive
foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training
strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and
preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through
extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and
achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56%
in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore,
through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content
detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by
14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results
establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating
excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 生成了包含20,000多种布局配置的数据集，显著提升了机器学习任务的准确性。

Conclusion: DALI-PD为物理设计中的机器学习研究提供了高效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in various
physical design (PD) tasks. However, model generalizability remains limited by
the availability of high-quality, large-scale training datasets. Creating such
datasets is often computationally expensive and constrained by IP. While very
few public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate,
and require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD,
a scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML
in PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout
heatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop,
congestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a
dataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts
and placements. These heatmaps closely resemble real layouts and improve ML
accuracy on downstream ML tasks such as IR drop or congestion prediction.

Motivation: 阿联酋依赖海水淡化获取饮用水，但该过程能耗高且受气候变化影响，尤其是AOD对太阳能淡化系统的性能有显著影响。

Method: 研究采用两阶段预测模型：第一阶段预测AOD，第二阶段预测淡化效率损失，并开发了基于AOD的智能控制逻辑。

Result: 模型准确率达98%，并通过SHAP分析揭示了系统退化的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究开发了交互式仪表盘，为气候适应性规划提供决策支持。

Abstract: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) relies heavily on seawater desalination to
meet over 90% of its drinking water needs. Desalination processes are highly
energy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity
consumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2
emissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges
in the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures,
salinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational
and economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through
photovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles.
  This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling
architecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series
and meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other
meteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses.
The framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study
proposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based
on predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to
adjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance
scheduling, and regulate energy source switching.
  To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive
models and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for
scenario and predictive analytics. This provides a management decision-support
system for climate-adaptive planning.

Result: 在真实和合成医学数据集上，FedGSCA在极端和异质噪声场景中表现优于现有方法，显著提升模型稳定性。

Conclusion: FedGSCA适用于现实医学联邦学习场景，有效解决噪声问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image
classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which
arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training
instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with
noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in
noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates
noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity
and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive
Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label
generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class
distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully
managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual
approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during
local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate
FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical
datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,
extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise
scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving
model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for
real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Conclusion: 数据质量和多样性对模型性能至关重要，次优扩展定律能更好地预测次扩展情况下的性能。

Abstract: Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that
increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent
studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where
performance improvements decelerate, which is a phenomenon known as
sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of
data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive
empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and
non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling.
High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information,
while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance
improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts
performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality
and diversity.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm
design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within
search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms.
However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general
coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored
for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how
well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this
paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring
fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank
based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality,
then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM
outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on
Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm
design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform
their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and
match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover,
we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm
design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings.
These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in
algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.

Result: RL在数学领域有轻微提升，但知识密集型任务表现下降；SFT影响更大且可能导致跨领域性能下降。

Conclusion: RL可能放大现有能力，而SFT可能用新技能替换旧技能，但冻结部分模型的效果尚不明确。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code
datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly
popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a
comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same
model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains
on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU,
while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters
across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights
the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer
MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the
out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of
the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with
benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together,
our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing
capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

Abstract: Algorithmic innovation in the pretraining of large language models has driven
a massive reduction in the total compute required to reach a given level of
capability. In this paper we empirically investigate the compute requirements
for developing algorithmic innovations. We catalog 36 pre-training algorithmic
innovations used in Llama 3 and DeepSeek-V3. For each innovation we estimate
both the total FLOP used in development and the FLOP/s of the hardware
utilized. Innovations using significant resources double in their requirements
each year. We then use this dataset to investigate the effect of compute caps
on innovation. Our analysis suggests that compute caps alone are unlikely to
dramatically slow AI algorithmic progress. Even stringent compute caps -- such
as capping total operations to the compute used to train GPT-2 or capping
hardware capacity to 8 H100 GPUs -- could still have allowed for half of the
cataloged innovations.

Conclusion: 元学习是复杂无线系统中智能控制的高效且安全的选择。

Abstract: The dynamic allocation of spectrum in 5G / 6G networks is critical to
efficient resource utilization. However, applying traditional deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is often infeasible due to its immense sample
complexity and the safety risks associated with unguided exploration, which can
cause severe network interference. To address these challenges, we propose a
meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn a robust initial policy
and rapidly adapt to new wireless scenarios with minimal data. We implement
three meta-learning architectures, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML),
recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention-enhanced RNN, and evaluate
them against a non-meta-learning DRL algorithm, proximal policy optimization
(PPO) baseline, in a simulated dynamic integrated access/backhaul (IAB)
environment. Our results show a clear performance gap. The attention-based
meta-learning agent reaches a peak mean network throughput of 48 Mbps, while
the PPO baseline decreased drastically to 10 Mbps. Furthermore, our method
reduces SINR and latency violations by more than 50% compared to PPO. It also
shows quick adaptation, with a fairness index 0.7, showing better resource
allocation. This work proves that meta-learning is a very effective and safer
option for intelligent control in complex wireless systems.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success
in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language
modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by
leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from
optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory
induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several
trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching,
providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive
bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including
reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent
weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting
informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments
demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating
in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and
supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical
application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts,
where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

Result: 在WyScout数据集上，HIGFormer显著优于现有方法，并提供球员表现评估的新视角。

Conclusion: HIGFormer为足球比赛预测和球员评估提供了高效工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Predicting soccer match outcomes is a challenging task due to the inherently
unpredictable nature of the game and the numerous dynamic factors influencing
results. While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep
learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective
player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.
However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of
interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling
match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous
Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep
learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a
multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player
dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a
Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through
heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a
global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which
constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model
historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which
jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match
outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a
large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly
outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide
valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation,
offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language
models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However,
prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training
instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty
mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's
current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled
learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more
resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning
framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive
prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively
balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's
reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,
effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of
approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently
outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning
baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances
both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a
scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning
models.

inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number
of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a
significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method
approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving
expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix.
Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance
comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster
segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.

*Jianing Zhi,Xinghua Li,Zidong Chen*

TL;DR: GeoHopNet是一种基于Hopfield增强的稀疏空间注意力网络，用于解决无人机动态选址问题，通过四项创新显著提升了计算效率和解决方案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市低空无人机经济的快速发展对动态选址提出了新挑战，传统深度强化学习方法在处理大规模问题时存在计算复杂度瓶颈。

Method: 提出GeoHopNet，包括距离偏置多头注意力机制、K近邻稀疏注意力、Hopfield外部记忆模块和记忆正则化策略。

Result: 在1000节点的大规模实例中，GeoHopNet在0.1秒内找到高质量解（0.22%最优性差距），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoHopNet通过创新设计显著提升了动态无人机选址问题的解决能力和效率。

Abstract: The rapid development of urban low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
economy poses new challenges for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points
and supply stations. Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face
computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention
mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper
proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network
specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach
introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention
mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest
neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$
to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory
regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet
extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with
1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3
seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds
high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared
to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method
improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中模型在适应新任务时遗忘旧知识的问题，同时平衡可塑性和稳定性。

Method: 结合ReLUDown（轻量级激活修改）和Decreasing Backpropagation（梯度调度方案）。

Result: 在Continual ImageNet上表现优于或匹配现有方法，同时降低计算成本。

Conclusion: RDBP为持续学习提供了实用解决方案，并为未来方法设定了基准。

Abstract: Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a
continuous stream of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, yet existing
approaches often tip the balance heavily toward either plasticity or stability.
We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two
complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that
preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing
Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that
progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the
Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and
stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP
thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a
clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be
measured.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决温度缩放和流形近似问题，统一不确定性校准和潜在控制。

Method: 使用对角高斯分布logits，最小化预测分布与单位各向同性高斯之间的KL散度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上表现优于softmax分类器，提升鲁棒性、校准性和潜在分离性。

Conclusion: ZClassifier在分类和生成任务中均表现出色，提供了一种概率化的统一框架。

Abstract: We introduce a novel classification framework, ZClassifier, that replaces
conventional deterministic logits with diagonal Gaussian-distributed logits.
Our method simultaneously addresses temperature scaling and manifold
approximation by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted Gaussian distributions and a unit isotropic Gaussian. This unifies
uncertainty calibration and latent control in a principled probabilistic
manner, enabling a natural interpretation of class confidence and geometric
consistency. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that ZClassifier
improves over softmax classifiers in robustness, calibration, and latent
separation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness for classifier-guided
generation by interpreting logits as Gaussian semantic potentials.

Conclusion: 该模型为快速、轻量、可持续、透明且准确的生物声学分析提供了新方案。

Abstract: A growing issue within conservation bioacoustics is the task of analysing the
vast amount of data generated from the use of passive acoustic monitoring
devices. In this paper, we present an alternative AI model which has the
potential to help alleviate this problem. Our model formulation addresses the
key issues encountered when using current AI models for bioacoustic analysis,
namely the: limited training data available; environmental impact, particularly
in energy consumption and carbon footprint of training and implementing these
models; and associated hardware requirements. The model developed in this work
uses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network
to store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify
species. Training is rapid ($3$\,ms), as only one representative signal is
required for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only
$5.4$\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat
recordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with
a small memory footprint of $144.09$\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low
computational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard
personal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing
devices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\%$ precision on the
dataset used to evaluate the model. In fact, we could not find a single case of
disagreement between model and manual identification via expert field guides.
Although a dataset of bat echolocation calls was chosen to demo this
first-of-its-kind AI model, trained on only two representative calls, the model
is not species specific. In conclusion, we propose an equitable AI model that
has the potential to be a game changer for fast, lightweight, sustainable,
transparent, explainable and accurate bioacoustic analysis.

Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human
cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems
with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical
generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement
symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of
radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a
group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining
characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder,
when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our
analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and
we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit
differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks
in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition
using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a
function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can
achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function,
and that learning speed is closely correlated with carry function structure. We
then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的框架，用于从部分观测的SPN轨迹中预测协变量依赖的速率函数系数，解决了传统参数估计的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPN的参数估计在协变量依赖和显式似然不可得时具有挑战性，需要一种高效且准确的方法。

Method: 使用轻量级1D卷积残差网络，通过端到端训练在Gillespie模拟的SPN实现上学习系统动态的反演。

Result: 在20%事件缺失的合成SPN上，RMSE为0.108，且比传统贝叶斯方法更快。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的无似然替代方法能实现复杂、部分观测离散事件系统中的准确、鲁棒和实时参数恢复。

Abstract: Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are an increasingly popular tool of choice for
modeling discrete-event dynamics in areas such as epidemiology and systems
biology, yet their parameter estimation remains challenging in general and in
particular when transition rates depend on external covariates and explicit
likelihoods are unavailable. We introduce a neural-surrogate
(neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework
that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions
directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a
lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on
Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under
realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout
provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On
synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function
coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than
traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven,
likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter
recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.

Result: 在训练数据被ε比例污染的情况下，方法实现了O(√ε)的估计误差。

Conclusion: 该研究首次为数据污染和分布偏移双重挑战下的学习提供了严格的理论保证和高效计算方法。

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a framework for
decision-making under distributional uncertainty, yet its effectiveness can be
compromised by outliers in the training data. This paper introduces a
principled approach to simultaneously address both challenges. We focus on
optimizing Wasserstein-1 DRO objectives for generalized linear models with
convex Lipschitz loss functions, where an $\epsilon$-fraction of the training
data is adversarially corrupted. Our primary contribution lies in a novel
modeling framework that integrates robustness against training data
contamination with robustness against distributional shifts, alongside an
efficient algorithm inspired by robust statistics to solve the resulting
optimization problem. We prove that our method achieves an estimation error of
$O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for the true DRO objective value using only the
contaminated data under the bounded covariance assumption. This work
establishes the first rigorous guarantees, supported by efficient computation,
for learning under the dual challenges of data contamination and distributional
shifts.

Conclusion: 该框架通过数据驱动和形式语言的组合语义，实现了高效的语言关联和行为生成，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Grounding language in complex perception (e.g. pixels) and action is a key
challenge when building situated agents that can interact with humans via
language. In past works, this is often solved via manual design of the language
grounding or by curating massive datasets relating language to elements of the
environment. We propose Ground-Compose-Reinforce, a neurosymbolic framework for
grounding formal language from data, and eliciting behaviours by directly
tasking RL agents through this language. By virtue of data-driven learning, our
framework avoids the manual design of domain-specific elements like reward
functions or symbol detectors. By virtue of compositional formal language
semantics, our framework achieves data-efficient grounding and generalization
to arbitrary language compositions. Experiments on an image-based gridworld and
a MuJoCo robotics domain show that our approach reliably maps formal language
instructions to behaviours with limited data while end-to-end, data-driven
approaches fail.

Abstract: This work aims to address the problem of long-term dynamic forecasting in
complex environments where data are noisy and irregularly sampled. While recent
studies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these
approaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term
extrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,
we propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics
knowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in
complex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture
long-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical
systems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization
ability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially
known physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system
dynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a
Phy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce
a physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align
with system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the
solutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world
applications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and
COVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of
Phy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation
tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/511205787/Phy_SSM-ICML2025.

Result: 在D4RL数据集上表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: Wasserstein距离结合ICNNs是一种有效的离线强化学习正则化方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from a
static dataset, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data
collection is costly, such as robotics. A major challenge in offline RL is
distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset
distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To
mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many
existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the
$f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the
Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures
the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks
(ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the
Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding
adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates
comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL
benchmark dataset. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces the framework of multi-armed sampling, as the sampling
counterpart to the optimization problem of multi-arm bandits. Our primary
motivation is to rigorously examine the exploration-exploitation trade-off in
the context of sampling. We systematically define plausible notions of regret
for this framework and establish corresponding lower bounds. We then propose a
simple algorithm that achieves these optimal regret bounds. Our theoretical
results demonstrate that in contrast to optimization, sampling does not require
exploration. To further connect our findings with those of multi-armed bandits,
we define a continuous family of problems and associated regret measures that
smoothly interpolates and unifies multi-armed sampling and multi-armed bandit
problems using a temperature parameter. We believe the multi-armed sampling
framework, and our findings in this setting can have a foundational role in the
study of sampling including recent neural samplers, akin to the role of
multi-armed bandits in reinforcement learning. In particular, our work sheds
light on the need for exploration and the convergence properties of algorithm
for entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, fine-tuning of pretrained
models and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between event pairs in a temporal sequence is
applicable in many domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and
transportation. Most existing work on causal inference primarily focuses on
event types within the designated domain, without considering the impact of
exogenous out-of-domain interventions. In real-world settings, these
out-of-domain interventions can significantly alter causal dynamics. To address
this gap, we propose a new causal framework to define average treatment effect
(ATE), beyond independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data in classic
Rubin's causal framework, to capture the causal relation shift between events
of temporal process under out-of-domain intervention. We design an unbiased ATE
estimator, and devise a Transformer-based neural network model to handle both
long-range temporal dependencies and local patterns while integrating
out-of-domain intervention information into process modeling. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms baselines in ATE estimation and goodness-of-fit under
out-of-domain-augmented point processes.

Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a theoretical foundation
using contextual bandits, introducing SC-LinUCB and proving it achieves lower
regret and adapts favourably in dynamic action spaces. Second, we provide
parallel empirical validation with Large Language Models, showing that SC is
critical for successful in-context learning in both static (efficient learning)

pipeline, and demonstrate on a benchmark with over 10,000 tools that SC-based
retrieval enables an LLM to effectively orchestrate over a large action space.

Abstract: Assortment optimization involves selecting a subset of substitutable products
(subject to certain constraints) to maximize the expected revenue. It is a
classic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various
industries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial
and non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph concolutional
networks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment
optimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a
graph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the
patterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies
based on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize
across inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale
instances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20
products), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+
optimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within
seconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and
efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a model-free setting where
the underlying choice model is unknown but transaction data is available. We
also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed policies in this setting.

Abstract: Cognitive reappraisal is a key strategy in emotion regulation, involving
reinterpretation of emotionally charged stimuli to alter affective responses.
Despite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world
reappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily
verbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is
often impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the
effectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based
augmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image
diffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we
introduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via
spoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally
congruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned
IP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'
reappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,
externalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we
conducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive
emotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive
images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without
AI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal
significantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control
conditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between
participant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,
suggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These
findings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive
reappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI,
affective computing, and therapeutic technology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图自编码器的潜在动力学替代模型（GALDS），用于高效模拟神经元树状网络中的物质运输，显著提升了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经元树状网络的复杂几何结构对物质运输的模拟提出了高计算要求，传统方法耗时且资源密集。

Method: GALDS结合图自编码器和神经ODE，通过潜在空间表示和动态预测优化模拟过程。

Result: 在八种未见几何结构和四种异常运输案例中，GALDS的平均相对误差为3%，最大误差<8%，速度提升10倍。

Conclusion: GALDS为神经元网络物质运输模拟提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which
play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport.
Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for
understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational
challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional
approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent
properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state
parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for
computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a
Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is
specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in
neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent
representations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration
profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global
graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent
space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration
of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models
with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component
effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in
recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated
through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport
examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum
relative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to
previous surrogate model approaches.

*Souvik Nath,Sumit Wadhwa,Luiz Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于编码器-解码器架构的小型语言模型（SLM），用于准确预测产品和服务的税务代码，解决了多国税务合规中的复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨国企业每天处理大量交易，需遵守不同司法管辖区的税务规定，准确预测税务代码（如HSN或SAC）对避免税务处罚至关重要。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构的SLM，利用非结构化产品和服务数据，生成层次化的税务代码序列，捕捉代码间的依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在结构化税务代码的序列预测任务中优于扁平分类器，且性能优于仅解码器或仅编码器架构。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他政府规定的税务代码（如UNSPSC或NCM），为税务合规提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of
which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often
nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC
is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes
is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive
small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the
enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we
address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using
unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon
encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes
to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our
experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied
to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains
comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat
classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and
achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only
architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also
be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United
Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura
Comum do Mercosul (NCM).

Abstract: System inference for nonlinear dynamic models, represented by ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), remains a significant challenge in many fields,
particularly when the data are noisy, sparse, or partially observable. In this
paper, we propose a Simulation-based Generative Model for Imperfect Data
(SiGMoID) that enables precise and robust inference for dynamic systems. The
proposed approach integrates two key methods: (1) physics-informed neural
networks with hyper-networks that constructs an ODE solver, and (2) Wasserstein
generative adversarial networks that estimates ODE parameters by effectively
capturing noisy data distributions. We demonstrate that SiGMoID quantifies data
noise, estimates system parameters, and infers unobserved system components.
Its effectiveness is validated validated through realistic experimental
examples, showcasing its broad applicability in various domains, from
scientific research to engineered systems, and enabling the discovery of full
system dynamics.

Result: 发现对抗性遗忘的效果取决于多种因素，提出了一种有效保护模型性能的方法。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效防止因遗忘请求（无论是自发还是恶意行为）导致的模型性能下降。

Abstract: AI models need to be unlearned to fulfill the requirements of legal acts such
as the AI Act or GDPR, and also because of the need to remove toxic content,
debiasing, the impact of malicious instances, or changes in the data
distribution structure in which a model works. Unfortunately, removing
knowledge may cause undesirable side effects, such as a deterioration in model
performance. In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial
unlearning, where a malicious party intentionally sends unlearn requests to
deteriorate the model's performance maximally. We show that this phenomenon and
the adversary's capabilities depend on many factors, primarily on the backbone
model itself and strategy/limitations in selecting data to be unlearned. The
main result of this work is a new method of protecting model performance from
these side effects, both in the case of unlearned behavior resulting from
spontaneous processes and adversary actions.

Conclusion: 提出的模型和验证方案为强化学习环境中的库存规划提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of forecasting the number of units fulfilled (or
``drained'') from each inventory warehouse to meet customer demand, along with
the associated outbound shipping costs. The actual drain and shipping costs are
determined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution
of customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be
delivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for
regional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated
into a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be
differentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can
be used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow
and costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this
as a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of
outbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period,
conditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure
robustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution
scenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories. We propose a validation
scheme that leverages production systems to evaluate the drain model on
counterfactual inventory states induced by RL policies. Preliminary results
demonstrate the model's accuracy within the in-distribution setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法假设数据难度在类间均匀分布，忽视了实际应用中类间数据难度的差异，导致性能下降。

Method: 引入类难度可分性系数（CDSC），并提出类比例变体的采样策略（如CCS-CP），以更有效地修剪数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，类比例方法在极端修剪率下性能下降更小，优于类无关方法。例如，在CTU-13数据集上，CCS-CP的精度仅下降0.49%。

Conclusion: 显式建模类难度可分性能显著提升数据修剪的效果，尤其在高风险场景中更具鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient
machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning
the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often
relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most
existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,
overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such
as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often
clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and
introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a
quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with
performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to
overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.
  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple
sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and
medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data
efficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a
class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows
remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and
recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best
method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and
4.11% in recall.
  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,
imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly
modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and
generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: 研究了三种扩散解码器设计、背包束搜索和多种损失函数，并与自回归解码器进行比较。

Result: 最佳扩散解码器设计结合DINOISER损失函数，氨基酸召回率显著提高0.373，但肽段精确率和召回率仍为0。

Conclusion: 扩散解码器在提高模型敏感性和推动肽段从头测序技术进步方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Peptide de novo sequencing is a method used to reconstruct amino acid
sequences from tandem mass spectrometry data without relying on existing
protein sequence databases. Traditional deep learning approaches, such as
Casanovo, mainly utilize autoregressive decoders and predict amino acids
sequentially. Subsequently, they encounter cascading errors and fail to
leverage high-confidence regions effectively. To address these issues, this
paper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data
domain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence
generation to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction
accuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs,
knapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search
did not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer
decoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide
precision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the
DINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in
amino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive
decoder-based Casanovo model. These findings highlight the potential of
diffusion decoders to not only enhance model sensitivity but also drive
significant advancements in peptide de novo sequencing.

Abstract: Stellar flare forecasting, a critical research frontier in astronomy, offers
profound insights into stellar activity. However, the field is constrained by
both the sparsity of recorded flare events and the absence of domain-specific
large-scale predictive models. To address these challenges, this study
introduces StellarF (Stellar Flare Forecasting), a novel large model that
leverages Low-Rank (LoRA) and Adapter techniques to parameter-efficient
learning for stellar flare forecasting. At its core, StellarF integrates an
flare statistical information module with a historical flare record module,
enabling multi-scale pattern recognition from observational data. Extensive
experiments on our self-constructed datasets (derived from Kepler and TESS

Conclusion: ClusterEnv无缝集成到现有RL流程中，支持多种方法，且代码改动极小。

Abstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) workloads often requires distributing
environment simulation across compute clusters. Existing frameworks entangle
simulation, learning logic, and orchestration into monolithic systems, limiting
modularity and reusability. We present ClusterEnv, a lightweight,
learner-agnostic interface for distributed environment execution that mirrors
the Gymnasium API. ClusterEnv introduces the DETACH pattern, which decouples
simulation from training by offloading reset() and step() operations to remote
workers while keeping learning centralized. To address policy staleness in
distributed execution, we propose Adaptive Actor Policy Synchronization (AAPS),
a divergence-triggered update mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead
without sacrificing performance. ClusterEnv integrates cleanly into existing RL
pipelines, supports both on-policy and off-policy methods, and requires minimal
code changes. Experiments on discrete control tasks demonstrate that AAPS
achieves high sample efficiency with significantly fewer weight updates. Source

Method: 通过一个简单的例子展示终端目标与工具目标的混淆如何导致严重的对齐问题，并分析其对强化学习的影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使是轻微的混淆也会导致奖励函数优化失败，性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 论文强调了区分终端目标与工具目标的重要性，并讨论了奖励学习中如何避免这一问题。

Abstract: Reward functions, learned or manually specified, are rarely perfect. Instead
of accurately expressing human goals, these reward functions are often
distorted by human beliefs about how best to achieve those goals. Specifically,
these reward functions often express a combination of the human's terminal
goals -- those which are ends in themselves -- and the human's instrumental
goals -- those which are means to an end. We formulate a simple example in
which even slight conflation of instrumental and terminal goals results in
severe misalignment: optimizing the misspecified reward function results in
poor performance when measured by the true reward function. This example
distills the essential properties of environments that make reinforcement
learning highly sensitive to conflation of instrumental and terminal goals. We
discuss how this issue can arise with a common approach to reward learning and
how it can manifest in real environments.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于VAE的潜在空间扰动方法在表格数据上具有实际应用价值，强调了流形上扰动的重要性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present fundamental challenges distinct
from image or text domains due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical
and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual
similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it
difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional
gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing
adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making
them detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a
mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial
examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical
features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve
statistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to
measure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly
available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method
achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance
compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted
from image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes
hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative
architectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically
on reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient
training data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold
perturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a
robust approach for practical deployment. The source code can be accessed

Conclusion: AdaMuon无需额外调参，可无缝集成到现有Muon训练流程中。

Abstract: We propose AdaMuon, an adaptive learning-rate framework built upon the
recently validated Muon optimizer, which has demonstrated substantial
efficiency gains over AdamW in large-scale model training. AdaMuon augments
Muon with two mutually dependent modules: (1) a per-parameter second-moment
modulation that captures orthogonal gradient updates to ensure update-level
adaptivity, and (2) a RMS-aligned rescaling that regulates the overall update
magnitude by aligning it with the intrinsic structure of the parameter space.
Empirical results on multiple model scales and learning-rate regimes confirm
that AdaMuon consistently outperforms the original Muon, delivering higher
acceleration in convergence while maintaining training stability. Our method
introduces no additional tuning burden and can be seamlessly integrated into

the underlying dynamics. More accurate predictions of TKE were achieved by
employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between
the predictors and the target variable. The results demonstrate significant
success, particularly from regression models, in accurately predicting the TKE.
The findings of this study demonstrate a novel numerical approach to
identifying new relationships between temperature and airflow processes in and

understanding of combustion environment processes and the coupling and
decoupling of fire environment processes necessary for improving fire

TL;DR: FOEM是一种新的PTQ方法，通过显式引入一阶梯度项改进量化误差补偿，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有补偿式权重校准方法假设一阶项可忽略，但实际存在累积偏差，导致假设不成立。

Method: FOEM直接计算潜在权重与全精度权重的差异来近似梯度，避免高成本的反向传播，并利用预计算的Cholesky因子高效恢复Hessian子矩阵的逆。

Result: FOEM在3位量化下显著降低困惑度，提升准确率，接近全精度性能，并能与其他先进技术无缝集成。

Conclusion: FOEM解决了现有PTQ方法的局限性，显著提升了量化模型的性能，且计算开销小。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing
large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and
computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods
often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,
under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained
full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation
process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights
and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally
flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly
incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error
compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference
between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited
generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach
introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages
precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian
submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models
and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical
GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of
Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from
51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.
Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as
GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging
W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision
baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is
available at https://github.com/Xingyu-Zheng/FOEM.

Conclusion: REPPO成功结合了路径策略梯度和在线学习的优势，提供了一种高效稳定的策略优化方法。

Abstract: Score-function policy gradients have delivered strong results in
game-playing, robotics and language-model fine-tuning. Yet its high-variance
often undermines training stability. On the other hand, pathwise policy
gradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by
an accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to
train without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to
construct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training
Q-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using
pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to
balance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for
stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that
facilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we
propose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient
on-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy
gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard
on-policy learning. We demonstrate that REPPO provides strong empirical
performance at decreased sample requirements, wall-clock time, memory footprint
as well as high hyperparameter robustness in a set of experiments on two
standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks.

Conclusion: GATE通过建模非欧几里得噪声和动态图适应，显著提升了室内定位性能。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart
environments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)
fingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its
compatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve
accuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but
they assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to
incorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of
real-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous
mobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS
readings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models
by encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal
relationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise
distributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded
accuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these
challenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive
graph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor
state-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to
mitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces
1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a
novel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind
spot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic
graph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor
spaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices
demonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and
1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor
localization frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MILP缺乏有效的实例相似性度量方法，现有方法依赖标签数据或精度不足，限制了其应用和泛化能力。

Method: 提出数学距离度量，离散化右侧值、权重和变量，利用Earth mover's distance量化权重-变量分布差异，支持实例级比较。

Result: 在StrIPLIB数据集上验证，贪婪版本精度接近精确版本且速度快200倍，优于现有非学习方法，媲美监督分类器。

Conclusion: 该方法为MILP实例相似性比较提供了高效、无监督的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful tool for addressing a
wide range of real-world problems, but it lacks a clear structure for comparing
instances. A reliable similarity metric could establish meaningful
relationships between instances, enabling more effective evaluation of instance
set heterogeneity and providing better guidance to solvers, particularly when
machine learning is involved. Existing similarity metrics often lack precision
in identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits
their applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived
directly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand
sides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws
inspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in
weight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons. This approach
naturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an
exact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings,
using the StrIPLIB dataset. Results show that all components of the metric
contribute to class identification, and that the greedy version achieves
accuracy nearly identical to the exact formulation while being nearly 200 times
faster. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including feature-based,
image-based, and neural network models, our unsupervised method consistently
outperforms all non-learned approaches and rivals the performance of a
supervised classifier on class and subclass grouping tasks.

Conclusion: 基于时间值的BOCPD框架能有效检测漂移规避欺骗攻击，提升无人机导航的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time
localization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to
sophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to
deceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly
perturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without
triggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional
distributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a
threshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and
timely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are
essential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with
alternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy
adversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point
detection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates
from a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural
deviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal
value-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors,
temporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test,
achieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative
rates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.

Conclusion: GRNGC解决了现有模型的局限性，在效率和灵活性上表现优异，适用于基因调控网络重建等实际应用。

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural
network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these
models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most
existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the
construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in
substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing
penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal
relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To
address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural
Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model
and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and
output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific
time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures
such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical
simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC
outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational
overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder
urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in
reconstructing gene regulatory networks.

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables multiple
devices (i.e., agents) to train a shared model cooperatively without exchanging
raw data. This technique keeps data localized on user devices, ensuring privacy
and security, while each agent trains the model on their own data and only
shares model updates. The communication overhead is a significant challenge due
to the frequent exchange of model updates between the agents and the central
server. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient federated learning
scheme that utilizes low-rank approximation of neural network gradients and
quantization to significantly reduce the network load of the decentralized
learning process with minimal impact on the model's accuracy.

Abstract: Heart disease remains a major global health concern, particularly in regions
with limited access to medical resources and diagnostic facilities. Traditional
diagnostic methods often fail to accurately identify and manage heart disease
risks, leading to adverse outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to
significantly enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and speed of heart disease
diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines
classification models for heart disease detection and regression models for
risk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035
cases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an
additional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to
evaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random
Forest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on

demonstrated the highest R2 values of 0.992 and 0.984 on real and synthetic

Explainable AI techniques were employed to enhance the interpretability of the

Abstract: Online collaborative medical prediction platforms offer convenience and
real-time feedback by leveraging massive electronic health records. However,
growing concerns about privacy and low prediction quality can deter patient
participation and doctor cooperation. In this paper, we first clarify the
privacy attacks, namely attribute attacks targeting patients and model
extraction attacks targeting doctors, and specify the corresponding privacy
principles. We then propose a privacy-preserving mechanism and integrate it
into a novel one-shot distributed learning framework, aiming to simultaneously
meet both privacy requirements and prediction performance objectives. Within
the framework of statistical learning theory, we theoretically demonstrate that
the proposed distributed learning framework can achieve the optimal prediction
performance under specific privacy requirements. We further validate the

Abstract: Gradient descent (GD) on logistic regression has many fascinating properties.
When the dataset is linearly separable, it is known that the iterates converge
in direction to the maximum-margin separator regardless of how large the step
size is. In the non-separable case, however, it has been shown that GD can
exhibit a cycling behaviour even when the step sizes is still below the
stability threshold $2/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of
the Hessian at the solution. This short paper explores whether restricting the
data to have equal magnitude is a sufficient condition for global convergence,
under any step size below the stability threshold. We prove that this is true
in a one dimensional space, but in higher dimensions cycling behaviour can
still occur. We hope to inspire further studies on quantifying how common these
cycles are in realistic datasets, as well as finding sufficient conditions to
guarantee global convergence with large step sizes.

Conclusion: 生成模型能够显著提升CTR预测精度，未来将公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models are integral to a myriad of
industrial settings, such as personalized search advertising. Current methods
typically involve feature extraction from users' historical behavior sequences
combined with product information, feeding into a discriminative model that is
trained on user feedback to estimate CTR. With the success of models such as
GPT, the potential for generative models to enrich expressive power beyond
discriminative models has become apparent. In light of this, we introduce a
novel model that leverages generative models to enhance the precision of CTR
predictions in discriminative models. To reconcile the disparate data
aggregation needs of both model types, we design a two-stage training process:
1) Generative pre-training for next-item prediction with the given item
category in user behavior sequences; 2) Fine-tuning the well-trained generative
model within a discriminative CTR prediction framework. Our method's efficacy
is substantiated through extensive experiments on a new dataset, and its
significant utility is further corroborated by online A/B testing results.
Currently, the model is deployed on one of the world's largest e-commerce
platforms, and we intend to release the associated code and dataset in the

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了样本效率，且成本几乎可以忽略。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents excel in solving complex
decision-making tasks across various domains. However, they often require a
substantial number of training steps and a vast experience replay buffer,
leading to significant computational and resource demands. To address these
challenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that
focus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the
factual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is
computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer,
effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments
across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and
SAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents
without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up
to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost.

*Amit Attia,Matan Schliserman,Uri Sherman,Tomer Koren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了随机梯度下降（SGD）在平滑凸目标函数和插值条件下的收敛性，特别是在最优解附近噪声为零或接近零时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SGD在过参数化模型训练、持续学习中的遗忘问题以及随机Kaczmarz方法解线性系统时的收敛行为。

Method: 分析SGD在β-平滑凸损失函数上的表现，步长η≤1/β，计算最后迭代的期望超额风险。

Result: 得到最后迭代的期望超额风险为O~(1/(ηT^(1-βη/2)) + ηT^(βη/2)σ⋆^2)，优化步长下可达O~(1/T + σ⋆/√T)。

Conclusion: 在σ⋆=0时，步长η=1/β下收敛速度为O(1/√T)，优于现有结果。

Abstract: We study population convergence guarantees of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) for smooth convex objectives in the interpolation regime, where the noise
at optimum is zero or near zero. The behavior of the last iterate of SGD in
this setting -- particularly with large (constant) stepsizes -- has received
growing attention in recent years due to implications for the training of
over-parameterized models, as well as to analyzing forgetting in continual
learning and to understanding the convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz method
for solving linear systems. We establish that after $T$ steps of SGD on
$\beta$-smooth convex loss functions with stepsize $\eta \leq 1/\beta$, the
last iterate exhibits expected excess risk $\widetilde{O}(1/(\eta
T^{1-\beta\eta/2}) + \eta T^{\beta\eta/2} \sigma_\star^2)$, where
$\sigma_\star^2$ denotes the variance of the stochastic gradients at the
optimum. In particular, for a well-tuned stepsize we obtain a near optimal
$\widetilde{O}(1/T + \sigma_\star/\sqrt{T})$ rate for the last iterate,
extending the results of Varre et al. (2021) beyond least squares regression;
and when $\sigma_\star=0$ we obtain a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ with
$\eta=1/\beta$, improving upon the best-known $O(T^{-1/4})$ rate recently
established by Evron et al. (2025) in the special case of realizable linear
regression.

### [168] [Guiding LLM Decision-Making with Fairness Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11344)
*Zara Hall,Melanie Subbiah,Thomas P Zollo,Kathleen McKeown,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练通用公平奖励模型（FRM）的框架，用于减少大型语言模型在高风险决策中的偏见，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在高风险决策中可能放大不公平偏见的问题，确保其可信赖性。

Method: 通过训练一个通用的公平奖励模型（FRM），对LLM的推理进行公平性评分，减少偏见轨迹的权重。

Result: FRM无需额外微调即可跨任务、领域和模型家族迁移，并在实际任务中提高公平性，同时保持或超越基线准确性。

Conclusion: FRM框架为高风险决策中公平使用LLM提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to support high-stakes decisions,
potentially influencing who is granted bail or receives a loan. Naive
chain-of-thought sampling can improve average decision accuracy, but has also
been shown to amplify unfair bias. To address this challenge and enable the
trustworthy use of reasoning models in high-stakes decision-making, we propose
a framework for training a generalizable Fairness Reward Model (FRM). Our model
assigns a fairness score to LLM reasoning, enabling the system to down-weight
biased trajectories and favor equitable ones when aggregating decisions across
reasoning chains. We show that a single Fairness Reward Model, trained on
weakly supervised, LLM-annotated examples of biased versus unbiased reasoning,
transfers across tasks, domains, and model families without additional
fine-tuning. Applied to real-world decision-making tasks including recidivism
prediction and social media moderation, we show that our approach consistently
improves fairness while matching, or even surpassing, baseline accuracy.

*Emile van Krieken,Pasquale Minervini,Edoardo Ponti,Antonio Vergari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了神经符号（NeSy）预测器中符号概念独立性假设的局限性，指出其可能导致模型无法正确表示某些概念组合的不确定性，从而忽视推理捷径问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示独立性假设对NeSy预测器学习和不确定性建模的负面影响，并验证其在特定场景下的局限性。

Method: 通过形式化证明，展示独立性假设如何限制模型对某些概念组合不确定性的表示能力。

Result: 结果表明，独立性假设会导致模型无法意识到推理捷径问题，即预测任务正确但理由错误。

Conclusion: 结论指出独立性假设在NeSy系统中存在根本性缺陷，需重新审视其适用性。

Abstract: The ubiquitous independence assumption among symbolic concepts in
neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors is a convenient simplification: NeSy predictors
use it to speed up probabilistic reasoning. Recent works like van Krieken et
al. (2024) and Marconato et al. (2024) argued that the independence assumption
can hinder learning of NeSy predictors and, more crucially, prevent them from
correctly modelling uncertainty. There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy
community around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually
limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle
this question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic
concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain
concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of reasoning shortcuts,
i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct
downstream tasks but for the wrong reasons.

*Daniel Tanneberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种无需反向传播的神经网络训练方法，通过局部信号和层间损失在强化学习（RL）中实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播（BP）需要存储激活值且易出现梯度消失或爆炸问题，影响学习性能和稳定性。

Method: 采用局部信号和层间损失（基于多维标度距离匹配），在正向传播中训练每层网络，无需反向传播。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在RL基准测试中性能与传统BP相当，且稳定性和一致性更优。

Conclusion: 该方法在RL中实现了高效、稳定的训练，尤其适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Training neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) typically relies on
backpropagation (BP), necessitating storage of activations from the forward
pass for subsequent backward updates. Furthermore, backpropagating error
signals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding
gradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a
novel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals
during the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local,
layer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from
multi-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This
method allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed
during forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and
storing intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy
gradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this
backpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their
classical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances
stability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance
especially in challenging environments.

*Gabriel Bo,Koa Chang,Justin Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPaRK是一种新型强化学习框架，通过双目标奖励系统优化答案质量和工具多样性，训练语言模型探索多样化工具使用模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高温采样方法限制了语言模型的工具使用多样性，SPaRK旨在通过强化学习框架解决这一问题。

Method: 采用离线PPO训练Llama-3.1 8B模型，结合双目标奖励系统和稀有工具优先策略，利用GPT-4o评分工具选择。

Result: 在14个MMLU-Pro类别中表现优异，工具选择熵显著高于基线方法，表明工具多样性可提升推理能力。

Conclusion: SPaRK通过显式工具多样性增强推理能力，同时保持准确性，为语言模型工具探索提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present Step-wise Policy for Rare-tool Knowledge (SPaRK), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that teaches large language models to explore
diverse tool usage patterns beyond conventional high-temperature sampling.
Building on recent advances in step-wise reinforcement learning, we introduce a
dual-objective reward system that simultaneously optimizes for answer quality
and tool diversity, training a Llama-3.1 8B model through offline PPO on
synthetically generated trajectories from the MMLU-Pro dataset. Our approach
uniquely employs a rarity-first exploitation strategy where a GPT-4o judge
scores candidate actions across eight distinct tools plus chain-of-thought
reasoning, with the policy favoring less-frequently used but still viable tools
to encourage systematic exploration. Empirical results demonstrate that SPaRK
achieves competitive performance across 14 MMLU-Pro categories while exhibiting
significantly higher entropy in tool selection compared to both baseline and
supervised fine-tuning approaches, suggesting that algorithmic exploration
through explicit tool diversity can enhance reasoning capabilities without
sacrificing accuracy.

### [172] [A Neural Network Model of Complementary Learning Systems: Pattern Separation and Completion for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11393)
*James P Jun,Vijay Marupudi,Raj Sanjay Shah,Sashank Varma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合变分自编码器（VAE）和现代Hopfield网络（MHN）的持续学习模型，以减少神经网络中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够学习新知识而不遗忘旧知识，而神经网络存在灾难性遗忘问题。互补学习系统（CLS）理论为这一现象提供了生物学解释。

Method: 利用VAE的泛化能力和MHN的稳健记忆存储特性，构建了一个神经合理的持续学习模型。

Result: 在Split-MNIST任务中，模型达到了接近最先进的准确率（约90%），显著减少了遗忘。

Conclusion: 该模型为生物和人工系统中的记忆巩固、泛化和持续学习提供了功能模板。

Abstract: Learning new information without forgetting prior knowledge is central to
human intelligence. In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic
forgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned
tasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS)
theory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain
has distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and
pattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture
these complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization
capabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage
properties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally
plausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST
task, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to
state-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting.
Representational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the
VAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By
capturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work
provides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation,
generalization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial
systems.

*Seyedsaman Emami,Gonzalo Martínez-Muñoz,Daniel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的多任务梯度提升框架（R-MTGB），通过建模任务异质性并分块处理，有效隔离异常任务并提升多任务学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中异常任务会降低模型性能，需一种能自动检测并处理这些任务的方法。

Method: R-MTGB分三阶段：学习共享模式、正则化参数划分异常任务、微调任务特定预测器。

Result: 实验表明R-MTGB能隔离异常任务、促进知识迁移，并降低各任务预测误差。

Conclusion: R-MTGB在多任务学习中表现出鲁棒性、适应性和可靠收敛性。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared
information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share
similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms
have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems,
primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and
iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for
learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve
tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which
do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate
the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose
Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that
explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB
structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning
shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with
regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This
architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks
while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method
integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing
robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers
knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task
individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These
results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB
in challenging MTL environments.

### [174] [Toward Improving fNIRS Classification: A Study on Activation Functions in Deep Neural Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11436)
*Behtom Adeli,John McLinden,Pankaj Pandey,Ming Shao,Yalda Shahriari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了不同激活函数在fNIRS分类任务中的表现，发现对称激活函数（如Tanh和Abs(x））在某些架构中优于ReLU，并强调了选择适合fNIRS信号特性的激活函数的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fNIRS领域中的非线性、低信噪比和信号变异性对模型准确性提出了挑战，但激活函数对深度学习性能的影响尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 使用多种深度学习架构（如fNIRSNet、AbsoluteNet等）评估传统和领域特定的激活函数，并在单一数据集上进行标准化测试。

Result: 对称激活函数（如Tanh和Abs(x））在某些架构中表现优于ReLU，且对称性分析进一步支持其性能提升。

Conclusion: 选择与fNIRS信号特性匹配的激活函数对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks,
particularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),
where nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability
poses significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of
activation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain
remains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current
literature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific
activation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep
learning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,
MDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset
recorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks
were trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent
training parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions
such as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly
used functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the
architecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was
conducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further
supporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance
gains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation
functions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iTransformer是目前多变量时间序列预测中最受欢迎的模型之一，但其倒置框架存在局限性。作者提出了一种新的数据增强方法DAIF，通过频率过滤和跨变量修补策略解决了这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iTransformer虽然能有效捕捉多变量相关性，但其倒置框架削弱了时间依赖性信息，并在变量相关性不显著时引入噪声。

Method: 提出DAIF方法，包括频率过滤和跨变量修补两种策略，专门针对倒置框架设计。

Result: 在多个数据集和倒置模型上的实验证明了DAIF的有效性。

Conclusion: DAIF成功解决了iTransformer倒置框架的局限性，提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Currently, iTransformer is one of the most popular and effective models for
multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Thanks to its inverted framework,
iTransformer effectively captures multivariate correlation. However, the
inverted framework still has some limitations. It diminishes temporal
interdependency information, and introduces noise in cases of nonsignificant
variable correlation. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel data
augmentation method on inverted framework, called DAIF. Unlike previous data
augmentation methods, DAIF stands out as the first real-time augmentation
specifically designed for the inverted framework in MTS forecasting. We first
define the structure of the inverted sequence-to-sequence framework, then
propose two different DAIF strategies, Frequency Filtering and Cross-variation
Patching to address the existing challenges of the inverted framework.
Experiments across multiple datasets and inverted models have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our DAIF.

TL;DR: LRMR框架通过两阶段LLM方法提升直肠癌淋巴结转移评估的准确性和可解释性，优于传统深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI评估和现有AI模型在淋巴结转移诊断中表现有限且缺乏可解释性，LRMR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LRMR采用两阶段方法：1) 多模态LLM生成淋巴结的放射学特征报告；2) 文本LLM进行患者间特征比较和风险排序。

Result: 在117例患者中，LRMR的AUC为0.7917，F1-score为0.7200，优于ResNet50等基线模型。

Conclusion: LRMR通过分离视觉感知与认知推理，为淋巴结转移评估提供了高效、可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Accurate preoperative assessment of lymph node (LN) metastasis in rectal
cancer guides treatment decisions, yet conventional MRI evaluation based on
morphological criteria shows limited diagnostic performance. While some
artificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black
boxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these
models typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level
context. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven
Relational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic
task from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and
ranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal
large language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a
patient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological
features. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these
reports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based
on the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a
retrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under
the curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of
deep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies
confirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational
ranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant
performance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our
work demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning
through a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and
effective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备的普及，处理分布式的非线性时间序列数据成为关键挑战，传统集中式方法存在延迟和通信成本问题。

Result: 实验表明，联邦学习在非线性数据分布下表现较差，但合适的去趋势技术能显著提升其性能。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在处理非线性时间序列数据时需结合去趋势技术以优化性能。

Abstract: With advancements in computing and communication technologies, the Internet
of Things (IoT) has seen significant growth. IoT devices typically collect data
from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of
this data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is
centralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased
communication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective
alternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the
need to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and
environmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different
locations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.
Accurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is
crucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather
forecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction
accuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how
non-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized
extreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.
(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series
data influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated
several synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and
trained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL
approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world
datasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental
results show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when
dealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate
detrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different
data distributions.

Result: 结合RL与Oracle的方法在多种数据集上表现稳健，准确性优于传统技术。

Conclusion: RL结合Oracle的框架为纤维追踪提供了可靠解决方案，IRT进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Tractography algorithms leverage diffusion MRI to reconstruct the fibrous
architecture of the brain's white matter. Among machine learning approaches,
reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
tractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects.
TractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by
incorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based
mechanism. In this paper, we investigate four extensions of the original
TractOracle-RL framework by integrating recent advances in RL, and we evaluate
their performance across five diverse diffusion MRI datasets. Results
demonstrate that combining an oracle with the RL framework consistently leads
to robust and reliable tractography, regardless of the specific method or
dataset used. We also introduce a novel RL training scheme called Iterative
Reward Training (IRT), inspired by the Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) paradigm. Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages
bundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout
training. Experimental results show that RL methods trained with oracle
feedback significantly outperform widely used tractography techniques in terms
of accuracy and anatomical validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数在深度神经网络中存在梯度传播和稳定性问题，Wendland RBFs因其紧支撑性、平滑性和正定性，有望改进这些问题。

Method: 结合标准Wendland组件与线性和指数项，提出增强型Wendland激活函数，具有可调局部性、改进的梯度传播和训练稳定性。

Result: 在合成任务（如正弦波逼近）和基准数据集（MNIST、Fashion-MNIST）上表现优异，尤其在回归任务中精度更高。

Conclusion: Wendland激活函数将经典RBF理论与现代深度学习结合，能缓解过拟合并提升泛化能力，未来可探索混合架构和领域适配。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel parametric activation function based on
Wendland radial basis functions (RBFs) for deep neural networks. Wendland RBFs,
known for their compact support, smoothness, and positive definiteness in
approximation theory, are adapted to address limitations of traditional
activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The proposed enhanced
Wendland activation combines a standard Wendland component with linear and
exponential terms, offering tunable locality, improved gradient propagation,
and enhanced stability during training. Theoretical analysis highlights its
mathematical properties, including smoothness and adaptability, while empirical
experiments on synthetic tasks (e.g., sine wave approximation) and benchmark
datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate competitive performance. Results
show that the Wendland-based activation achieves superior accuracy in certain
scenarios, particularly in regression tasks, while maintaining computational
efficiency. The study bridges classical RBF theory with modern deep learning,
suggesting that Wendland activations can mitigate overfitting and improve
generalization through localized, smooth transformations. Future directions
include hybrid architectures and domain-specific adaptations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上运行大型语言模型（LLMs）面临通信带宽和计算资源限制，现有LoRA方法采用固定或启发式秩配置且传输效率低。

Method: AirLLM将秩配置建模为结构化动作向量，结合PPO生成粗粒度决策，并通过DDIM细化生成高分辨率秩向量，两者交替优化。

Result: 实验表明，AirLLM在不同信噪比下均能提升微调性能并显著减少传输开销。

Conclusion: AirLLM通过强化驱动和扩散优化的秩适应，实现了高效、可扩展的远程微调。

Abstract: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly
challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and
memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.
Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ
fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air
transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address
this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework
for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank
configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted
projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential
decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates
coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic
complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The
two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.
Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM
consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing
transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,
diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning
over the air.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经群体的动态结构和外部未观测影响需要模型捕捉，现有方法可能不足。

Method: 使用Langevin方程驱动的变分自编码器，结合物理先验（如惯性和阻尼）和局部耦合振荡器网络。

Result: 在合成数据和NLB基准测试中表现优异，解码行为指标（如手速）也优于或匹配其他方法。

Conclusion: LangevinFlow是一个灵活且高性能的框架，适用于复杂神经动态建模。

Abstract: Neural populations exhibit latent dynamical structures that drive
time-evolving spiking activities, motivating the search for models that capture
both intrinsic network dynamics and external unobserved influences. In this
work, we introduce LangevinFlow, a sequential Variational Auto-Encoder where
the time evolution of latent variables is governed by the underdamped Langevin
equation. Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia,
damping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent
both autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the
potential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled
oscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors
observed in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent
encoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent
space. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
synthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching
ground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model
achieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward
prediction accuracy across four challenging datasets. It also matches or
surpasses alternative methods in decoding behavioral metrics such as hand
velocity. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, physics-inspired,
high-performing framework for modeling complex neural population dynamics and
their unobserved influences.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research
and applications in other domains.

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the
3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of
1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different
datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in
providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor
segmentation.
