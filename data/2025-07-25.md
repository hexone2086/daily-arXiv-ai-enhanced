### [1] [Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801)
*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个独立的解码器自回归模型，通过从头训练实现高质量图像生成，性能媲美扩散模型，支持多任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视并振兴自回归范式，以提供高质量的图像生成和多任务处理能力，同时避免依赖预训练组件或混合架构。

Method: 采用从头训练的自回归模型，统一的分词方案支持多任务处理，结合高效解码策略（如推理时间缩放和推测性Jacobi采样）。

Result: 在文本到图像基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越扩散模型，同时在Graph200K基准测试中展现出强大的多任务能力。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个强大且灵活的统一多模态生成基础模型。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [2] [SV3.3B: A Sports Video Understanding Model for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17844)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B是一个轻量级的3.3B参数视频理解模型，用于自动化体育视频分析，结合了新颖的时间运动差异采样和自监督学习，显著提升了动作描述的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体育视频分析模型计算量大且缺乏对运动细节的理解，无法捕捉关键的运动阶段（如准备、执行和后续动作）。

Method: 采用DWT-VGG16-LDA关键帧提取机制和V-DWT-JEPA2编码器，结合LLM解码器生成动作描述。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集上表现优异，信息密度、动作复杂性和测量精度显著提升，性能优于GPT-4o等大模型。

Conclusion: SV3.3B在体育视频分析中表现出色，计算效率高，适合设备端部署。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++是一个无需训练的框架，通过渐进式细节注入策略（PDI）解决文本到图像生成中复杂提示的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理涉及多个主体和属性的复杂提示时表现不佳，受人类绘画过程的启发，提出了Detail++。

Method: 将复杂提示分解为简化子提示，分阶段生成，利用自注意力机制控制布局，并通过交叉注意力机制和质心对齐损失减少绑定噪声。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新构建的风格组合基准测试中，Detail++显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Detail++通过分阶段生成和优化绑定机制，有效提升了复杂提示下的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M是一个统一的水下鱼类检测基准，整合了13个公开数据集，评估了28种目标检测模型，并提出了基于CLIP的模型选择框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下鱼类检测中数据集碎片化、成像条件多样和评估协议不一致的问题。

Method: 整合13个数据集，使用COCO风格标注，评估28种模型，引入CLIP框架进行模型选择。

Result: 模型性能差异显著，CLIP框架实现了高效零-shot选择。

Conclusion: FishDet-M为水下计算机视觉提供了标准化评估平台。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究利用生成式AI（GenAI）模型LightningDiT评估皮肤癌分类器的公平性，发现合成数据在公平性评估中具有潜力，但需注意训练数据与合成数据的匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤癌筛查中的应用潜力巨大，但存在潜在偏见问题，评估和改进公平性至关重要。

Method: 利用先进的生成式AI模型LightningDiT生成高度真实的合成数据，评估公开可用的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性。

Result: 合成数据在公平性评估中表现出潜力，但若评估模型与合成数据训练数据不匹配，验证公平性会变得困难。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种利用合成数据评估和改进医疗影像AI系统公平性的新方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restormer使用通道自注意力解决Transformer在图像恢复中的高计算成本问题，但可能忽略局部伪影。DiNA结合滑动窗口和混合膨胀因子平衡全局与局部信息，但直接应用于去模糊任务效果不佳。DiNAT-IR通过通道感知模块整合全局上下文，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在图像恢复任务中因自注意力机制高计算成本导致的效率与质量权衡问题，同时弥补Restormer忽略局部伪影的不足。

Method: 提出Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA)结合滑动窗口和混合膨胀因子，并引入通道感知模块以整合全局上下文。

Result: DiNAT-IR在多个基准测试中取得竞争性结果，为低层次计算机视觉问题提供高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR通过平衡全局与局部信息，有效提升了图像恢复任务的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应特征细化（AFR）模块，用于无监督域自适应语义分割（UDA-SS），通过结合高低分辨率特征和高频组件提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法难以平衡局部细节与全局上下文信息，导致复杂区域分割错误。

Method: 引入AFR模块，利用低分辨率logits的语义先验细化高分辨率特征，并整合高频组件和不确定性驱动的注意力机制。

Result: 在GTA V→Cityscapes和Synthia→Cityscapes上分别提升1.05%和1.04%的mIoU。

Conclusion: AFR模块轻量且高效，显著提升了UDA-SS的性能。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OPEN数据集，用于AI驱动的老年人虚拟学习参与度识别，填补了老年人在虚拟康复学习中数据和研究不足的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟学习中参与度的准确测量对老年人在线教育和康复至关重要，但现有研究多关注年轻群体，缺乏针对老年人的数据和上下文相关方法。

Method: 通过收集11名老年人六周虚拟学习数据，提取面部、手部和身体关节特征，并标注参与度、情感和行为标签。

Result: 训练多种机器学习模型，参与度识别准确率达81%。

Conclusion: OPEN数据集为老年人个性化参与度建模提供了可扩展的基础，推动了参与度识别研究。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于YOLO模型的自动化系统，用于实时监测鬃狮蜥的行为，解决了传统方法耗时且易出错的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监测鬃狮蜥行为的方法效率低且易出错，需要一种更高效、准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用五种YOLO变体（v5-v12）训练自定义数据集，通过视频分析和规则逻辑分类行为，YOLOv8s因平衡准确性和速度被选为最优模型。

Result: 系统在监测鬃狮蜥的晒太阳行为上表现可靠，但捕猎行为检测因蟋蟀识别准确率低（mAP@0.5=0.392）而不理想。

Conclusion: 该系统为控制环境下的爬行动物行为监测提供了可扩展方案，未来需提升蟋蟀检测以优化性能。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注地面视角，存在遮挡和覆盖范围有限的问题，空中视角能解决这些问题。

Method: 提出TCC-VPReID三流架构，通过风格鲁棒特征学习、基于记忆的跨视角适应和中间引导的时间建模。

Result: 实验表明AG-VPReID.VIR数据集具有独特挑战性，TCC-VPReID框架在多个评估协议中表现优异。

Conclusion: AG-VPReID.VIR数据集和TCC-VPReID框架为跨模态行人重识别提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了医学影像数据中标签偏差对深度学习模型特征学习和性能的影响，发现偏差子群的大小和可分性对模型特征表示和性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨医学影像数据中标签偏差（特别是影响特定子群的偏差）对医学AI系统公平性的影响。

Method: 使用EMBED数据集训练深度学习模型进行二元组织密度分类，模拟可分离和不可分离子群的标签偏差。

Result: 标签偏差导致模型特征表示显著偏移，偏移程度取决于子群大小和可分性；验证集标签是否干净对子群性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为理解医学影像AI中标签偏差对子群公平性的影响提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文首次推导出可优化的Grassmannian特征距离函数，用于刚性变换（R和t），并证明高维线性子空间的基可作为成本的显式表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能测量Grassmannian特征的接近性，但无法将距离表示为刚性变换的显式函数，限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 通过数学证明，利用高维线性子空间的基作为显式表示，提出基于变换基的可优化成本函数。

Result: 提出的成本函数及其扩展在计算机视觉任务中优于现有方法，提高了收敛性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接最小化测地距离，避免了表示模糊性，并能找到全局最优解。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

*Jake R. Patock,Nicole Catherine Lewis,Kevin McCoy,Christina Gomez,Canling Chen,Lorenzo Luzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRR-CoCa改进CoCa模型，结合LLM先进架构，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型架构落后于LLM，需改进以提升性能。

Method: 引入高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入。

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练和微调任务中显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa架构改进在多模态任务中表现优异且泛化能力强。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅的3D场景修复框架，通过自动掩膜优化和不确定性引导优化，显著提升了修复效果的多视角一致性和细节保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景修复任务面临多视角一致性和结构不规则性的挑战，现有方法难以有效解决。

Method: 结合自动掩膜优化（包括高斯场景过滤和反向投影）和不确定性引导的细粒度优化策略，修复稀疏视角下的3D场景。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和视角一致性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架为3D场景修复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，显著提升了修复结果的多视角一致性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Result: 总结了现有数据集和方法，提出了统一分类法，并展示了在心理健康评估中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 骨骼动作情感识别是一个快速发展的领域，但仍面临挑战，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁媒体真实性，传统检测方法对复杂定制伪造内容泛化能力不足。

Method: ViGText通过分块图像、构建图像和文本图，并利用图神经网络进行多级特征提取，结合空间和频域分析。

Result: 实验显示ViGText在泛化性评估中F1分数从72.45%提升至98.32%，鲁棒性方面召回率提高11.1%。

Conclusion: ViGText通过详细视觉与文本分析，为深度伪造检测设定了新标准，保障媒体真实性与信息完整性。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TAV的数据集，用于改进AI生成视频中多场景转换的连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频模型在单场景短片段上表现良好，但在多场景转换的长视频生成中存在困难，主要因为无法从提示中推断何时需要场景转换。

Method: 提出Transition-Aware Video (TAV)数据集，包含多场景转换的预处理视频片段，并通过后训练提升模型对场景转换的理解。

Result: 实验表明，使用TAV数据集后训练能提升场景转换理解能力，缩小生成与需求场景间的差距，并保持图像质量。

Conclusion: TAV数据集为多场景视频生成提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型的场景转换能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Dual-Scale-Former（DSFormer）和块聚类策略的新框架，用于提升视觉地点识别（VPR）的鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉地点识别在移动机器人定位中至关重要，但在环境变化和视角变化下性能不稳定。

Method: DSFormer通过双向信息传递和自注意力机制增强特征表示；块聚类策略优化数据集分区以提升鲁棒性。

Result: 方法在多个基准数据集上达到最优性能，减少30%训练数据需求，并显著提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为VPR提供了鲁棒的全局嵌入，适用于环境变化，并在性能和效率上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型合成具有透明度的真实前景，解决了可扩展配对数据不足的问题。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Result: 在多样场景中，VLM-IMI在定量指标和感知质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VLM-IMI通过语义指导和迭代优化，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌预后差，超声内镜（EUS）分割因噪声和低对比度问题依赖大量专家标注数据，现有方法效果不佳。

Method: 结合BiomedCLIP文本编码器和LoRA适配的SAM架构，通过文本提示学习实现自动分割，仅调整0.86%参数。

Result: 在公开数据集上，自动提示的Dice为82.69%，NSD为85.28%；手动提示性能更高，优于现有SOTA模型。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS首次将提示学习引入SAM医学图像分割，为EUS分割提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat

of these techniques for urban planners and policymakers.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

Result: 在Fishyscapes等真实基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了语义明确且计算高效的解决方案，适用于不确定性感知分割。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用RGB和红外图像的互补特性提升目标检测性能。

Method: 提出WaveMamba融合方法，包括WaveMamba Fusion Block（WMFB）和改进的检测头，通过低/高频子带融合和门控注意力机制实现特征整合。

Result: 在四个基准测试中平均mAP提升4.5%，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: WaveMamba通过高效的多频带融合策略，显著提升了跨模态目标检测性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

Result: 在从SemanticKITTI到SemanticPOSS和SemanticSlamantic的实验中，分割精度显著优于直接迁移和单模型UDA方法。

Conclusion: 结合对比学习和伪标签策略能有效解决复杂域差距问题，无需目标域标注。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba结合UNet和mamba机制，通过噪声抑制模块提升医学图像分割的泛化能力，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在数据稀缺时因过拟合噪声和无关模式而泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出Diff-UMamba架构，集成UNet和mamba机制，并引入噪声抑制模块（NRM）过滤无关特征。

Result: 在多个公开数据集（如MSD、AIIB23）上性能提升1-3%，在BraTS-21和内部NSCLC数据集上提升4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在低数据条件下显著提升分割精度和鲁棒性，适用于临床相关任务。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL是一种简化的自监督学习架构，通过门控特征融合有效整合多级表示，解决了金属材料显微图像分析中监督方法依赖大量标注数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料显微图像分析依赖监督方法，需为每个新数据集重新训练且在小样本下表现不稳定。自监督学习虽有望利用无标签数据，但多数方法仍需大规模数据集。MatSSL旨在克服这一限制。

Method: MatSSL采用门控特征融合整合多级表示，先在小规模无标签数据集上进行自监督预训练，再在多个基准数据集上微调模型。

Result: MatSSL在MetalDAM上达到69.13% mIoU，优于ImageNet预训练编码器的66.73%，并在EBC数据集上平均mIoU提升近40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL仅需少量无标签数据即可有效适应金相领域，同时保留从大规模自然图像预训练中学到的丰富可迁移特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Result: 学生模型推理速度提升6倍，图像质量与教师模型相当。

Conclusion: TeEFusion在保持高质量生成的同时，显著提升了效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Method: 提出LEAF模型，在微调阶段直接预测分割图以减少结果方差，并通过特征蒸馏对齐卷积层与基于Transformer的视觉编码器特征。

Result: 实验表明，LEAF在多种疾病类型的分割数据集上提升了原始扩散模型的性能，且未增加推理时的参数或计算量。

Conclusion: LEAF在不改变模型架构或增加推理负担的情况下，显著提升了医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D测试时适应方法依赖计算昂贵的空间域优化，且可能需要额外训练数据，难以处理点云的无序结构。

Method: 将点云表示为异常感知图，通过图傅里叶变换（GFT）转换到图谱域，仅优化低频分量（10%），再通过逆变换（IGFT）重建点云，结合特征图引导的自训练策略迭代优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上，GSDTTA优于现有3D测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: GSDTTA通过图谱域适应和低频优化，实现了高效且高性能的3D点云分类。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 龋齿对肺癌风险具有因果作用，建议将口腔护理和肺功能监测纳入癌症预防策略。

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

TL;DR: FieldLVLM框架通过结合领域感知语言生成和数据压缩多模态模型调优，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在科学领域数据理解上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在科学领域（如自然科学的复杂现场数据）的应用尚未充分探索，需要一种新方法来提升其理解能力。

Method: FieldLVLM包含两部分：1) 领域感知语言生成策略，提取关键物理特征并转换为结构化文本；2) 数据压缩多模态模型调优，简化输入并保留关键信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，FieldLVLM在新基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型视觉语言模型在科学研究中的应用提供了新可能性，缩小了大模型与领域特定发现之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个半监督语义分割（SemiSeg）在心电图（ECG）分割中的系统基准，通过整合多个公开数据集，评估了五种代表性算法，并发现Transformer架构优于卷积网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG分割对临床诊断至关重要，但公开标注数据稀缺，半监督学习可解决这一问题。

Method: 整合多个公开数据集，采用五种半监督语义分割算法，在两种架构（卷积网络和Transformer）和两种设置（域内和跨域）下评估，并提出ECG特定的训练配置和增强策略。

Result: Transformer在半监督ECG分割中表现优于卷积网络。

Conclusion: 该基准为半监督ECG分割方法的进一步发展奠定了基础，并促进了该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的核范数（MNN）框架，通过变换矩阵并应用核范数，同时捕获局部信息和全局低秩性，无需调参，并提供理论恢复保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统核范数（NN）在矩阵恢复问题中仅关注全局低秩性，忽略了局部信息。MNN旨在结合两者，提供更灵活和高效的方法。

Method: 定义MNN族范数，通过对矩阵进行适当变换后应用核范数，无需调参，且支持多种变换。

Result: 在Robust PCA和矩阵补全任务中，MNN提供了理论恢复保证，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: MNN框架是一种通用且灵活的方法，能够有效结合局部和全局信息，适用于结构化低秩恢复问题。

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空业的气候影响不仅包括CO2排放，还包括非CO2效应（如尾迹）。现有模型依赖大气输入数据和假设，但缺乏验证数据。GVCCS数据集旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用地面全天空相机记录尾迹，生成包含122个视频序列（24,228帧）的数据集，并开发了一个基于全景分割的深度学习框架进行尾迹分析。

Result: GVCCS数据集提供了高质量的时空分辨注释，支持尾迹生命周期的详细分析，并作为模型评估的基准。

Conclusion: 该工作为更准确的气候影响评估奠定了基础，有助于改进尾迹监测和物理模型校准。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Motivation: 传统方法将体素的感受野限制在图像的固定位置，缺乏灵活性和效率。SGCDet旨在通过自适应区域集成几何和上下文信息，提升体素特征的表达能力。

Method: 引入几何和上下文感知聚合模块，动态调整多视角贡献；提出稀疏体积构建策略，选择高占用概率的体素进行特征优化。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SGCDet通过自适应体积构建和稀疏优化，实现了高效且准确的3D物体检测，且仅需3D边界框监督。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 通过将频率信息嵌入到声谱图中，提出了一种改进鸟类物种分类的方法，显著提升了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决鸟类叫声分类中因环境噪声、重叠发声和标签缺失导致的挑战，现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中表现不佳。

Method: 通过可视化鸟类的音高模式、速度和重复（称为motifs），并将频率信息嵌入声谱图中以增强物种区分。

Result: 提出的方法在F1、ROC-AUC和CMAP指标上分别提升了7.3%、6.2%和6.6%，超越了BirdCLEF 2024的冠军模型。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化嵌入频率信息能有效提升鸟类物种分类的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Motivation: 人类能够通过跨视角学习传递知识，但目前的多模态大语言模型在此能力上尚未被探索。

Method: 构建EgoExoBench基准，包含7,300多个问答对，覆盖11个子任务，分为语义对齐、视角关联和时间推理三大挑战。

Result: 评估13个先进模型发现，它们在单视角任务表现优秀，但在跨视角语义对齐、视角关联和时间推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: EgoExoBench为研究具有跨视角智能的具身代理和智能助手提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various

development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Method: 使用注意力机制和前馈网络学习子像素位移场，自适应地扭曲特征图，实现全局特征变形和解耦卷积核大小与学习网络。基于此模块设计了GDCUnet模型用于眼底血管分割。

Conclusion: 提出的可变形卷积模块适用于具有复杂全局自相似特征的机器视觉任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Conclusion: MVG4D为从最小输入高效可控生成4D内容提供了新方向。

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Result: 在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和真实数据上验证了方法的优越性，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集和改进模型，显著提升了材料估计和渲染的真实感。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,

Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image

enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于V-JEPA的自监督学习方法，用于超声视频数据的分割任务，并通过引入3D定位辅助任务提升ViT模型的局部性理解，显著提高了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像数据获取和标注困难，自监督学习（SSL）可以利用未标注数据学习有用表示，V-JEPA框架因其对噪声不敏感且能利用时序信息，适合超声成像。

Method: 采用V-JEPA框架进行自监督预训练，并引入3D定位辅助任务以增强ViT模型的局部性理解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同训练数据量下显著提升分割性能，最高提升8.35%（仅使用10%训练数据）。

Conclusion: V-JEPA结合3D定位辅助任务是一种有效的超声视频分割方法，尤其在数据有限时表现优异。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

<details>

Motivation: 头部姿态估计在计算机视觉应用中至关重要，但现有数据集标注不准确且训练数据有限，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合张量分解（Tucker分解）和神经网络，将头部姿态估计建模为回归问题，通过余弦曲线建模流形。

Result: 生成精确的2D头部姿态数据集，实现了有限训练数据下的实时性能。

Conclusion: NLML-HPE方法在有限数据下高效且准确，适用于实时头部姿态估计。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Conclusion: PDB-Eval能有效弥合MLLMs与驾驶领域的差距，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Result: 成功将仿真攻击转移到真实LiDAR系统，并分析了影响攻击成功的因素。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了公平比较和加速研究，增进了对真实LiDAR感知中对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Conclusion: CRUISE为V2X场景的数据增强和仿真提供了有效工具，推动了自动驾驶技术的发展。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We
release the code and models at https://github.com/emirhanbayar/QFAE.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

Method: 采用多步目标平衡即时预测精度与预测熵最小化，结合不确定性导向的奖励机制优化策略。

Result: 实验显示Rein-EAD显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持标准精度，并能泛化至未见攻击。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD适用于复杂任务（如3D分类、人脸识别和自动驾驶），具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Conclusion: 通过车辆运动状态自适应集成地图不确定性，显著提升了轨迹预测性能，且具有可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Conclusion: EDA通过引入任意噪声模式，显著提升了扩散模型在图像恢复任务中的表现，且计算效率高。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these

TL;DR: SynC是一个专为零样本图像描述（ZIC）设计的框架，通过重新分配语义对齐的图像-标题对来优化合成数据集，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像（T2I）模型生成的合成数据中图像与标题语义不对齐的问题，提升ZIC模型的训练效果。

Method: 采用一对多映射策略，通过检索候选图像并利用循环一致性对齐评分器选择最佳图像-标题对。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（MS-COCO、Flickr30k、NoCaps）中显著提升了ZIC模型的性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SynC为优化合成数据提供了一种有效策略，显著提升了ZIC模型的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基础模型在高度杂乱场景中进行语义对象分割的能力，提出基于注视点生成提示的方法，并在真实数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标应用是视觉引导的上肢神经假肢，需在自然场景中实现对象分割。

Method: 提出基于注视点生成提示的方法，指导Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行分割，并在自我中心视觉数据上微调。

Result: 在Grasping-in-the-Wild数据集上，IoU分割质量指标提升了0.51点。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自然场景中无需微调即可实现对象分割，结合注视点提示的方法显著提升了分割效果。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data
of Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus which is made available on the RoboFlow Platform

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SIDA的新型零样本域适应方法，利用合成图像替代文本描述，显著提升了适应效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本描述的方法难以捕捉复杂现实变化且适应时间较长，因此探索利用图像数据提供更细粒度的风格线索。

Method: 通过生成合成图像（源图像+目标风格转换），并引入Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块，建模真实世界变化。

Result: 在多种零样本适应场景中表现优异，尤其在挑战性领域，同时显著减少适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA通过合成图像和高效模块设计，实现了更高效、更准确的零样本域适应。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要精确的环境理解和导航，传统密集网格方法效率低，多模态传感器融合可提供互补信息。

Method: 使用3D高斯表示和模态无关的可变形注意力机制，融合相机、LiDAR和雷达数据，优化高斯属性。

Result: 在多种传感器组合测试中表现优异，超越了现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc通过多模态融合和高斯表示，实现了高效、精确的语义占据预测。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Result: 方法在多个开源模型上达到最优，并在IntentVC挑战中排名第二。

Conclusion: IntentVCNet有效提升了模型在视频序列中建模空间细节和生成意图导向描述的能力。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is
available on https://github.com/thqiu0419/IntentVCNet.

Conclusion: 早期结构特征对最终质量影响显著，重采样效果因生成尺度而异，TTS-VAR有效提升了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了高精度的无位姿重建，成为该领域的新标杆。

Conclusion: 该方法通过全局对齐和联合优化，显著提升了无位姿3DGS重建的效率和精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

Result: 方法显著优于现有方法，生成高保真度的去变形面部图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为变形攻击检测提供了更强大的工具，能够处理多样化的变形技术和面部风格。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

Motivation: DMD依赖反向KL散度可能导致模式崩溃，需改进。

Method: 提出ADM框架，利用扩散判别器在潜空间和像素空间对抗对齐，结合分布损失优化预训练。

Result: DMDX在SDXL上表现优于DMD2，GPU时间更少，并在多步蒸馏中设新基准。

Conclusion: DMDX为高效图像和视频合成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scenethesis是一种新型的3D软件合成方法，通过领域特定语言ScenethesisLang实现用户需求与生成软件的精确对应，解决了现有方法无法精细修改和控制3D元素的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D软件生成方法无法精细控制单个元素且难以处理复杂空间和语义约束，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 提出Scenethesis，基于ScenethesisLang（一种领域特定语言），将3D软件合成分解为多个阶段，支持独立验证和约束满足。

Result: Scenethesis能准确捕捉80%以上用户需求，满足90%以上硬约束，并在视觉评估中比现有方法提升42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis通过ScenethesisLang实现了3D软件生成的精细控制和约束满足，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基准测试，用于通过图像识别被调用的艺术家名称，评估了多种方法，并发现不同方法在不同场景下的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像模型中明确调用艺术家名称的争议性使用，并开发一个基准测试以促进负责任的模型管理。

Method: 构建包含110位艺术家的1.95M图像数据集，评估特征相似性、对比风格描述符、数据归因方法、监督分类器和少样本原型网络。

Result: 监督和少样本模型在已知艺术家和复杂提示下表现最佳，风格描述符在艺术家风格明显时表现更好，多艺术家提示最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 基准测试揭示了改进空间，并提供了公开数据集以推动文本到图像模型的负责任管理。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化电影生成提供了高质量和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

Abstract: Designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that enables a mobile robot
to safely navigate through an obstacle-filled environment is a complicated yet
essential task in robotics. In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring
that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions
with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This
report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements.
Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC
(LMPC) \cite{bemporad2007robust,kouvaritakis2016model}, NMPC
\cite{rawlings2017model,allgower2004nonlinear,mayne2014model,grune2017nonlinear,saltik2018outlook},
and their applications in various domains, including robotics
\cite{nascimento2018nonholonomic,nguyen2021model,shi2021advanced,wei2022mpc}.
This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it
focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation.
The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical
concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and
performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and
practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations
and real-world robotic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在常识推理方面表现优异，但在开放世界中实现语言描述到机器人动作的转换仍具挑战性。

Method: 利用MLLMs的跨模态理解和代码生成能力，结合视觉语言感知模型生成2D鸟瞰价值图，整合语义与空间信息。

Result: 在户外导航任务中验证了零样本视觉语言导航框架的多样性指令执行能力，并在室内外场景中展示了系统的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MLLMs能够有效解析复杂指令并生成导航轨迹，为开放世界机器人导航提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

Result: 在机器人-地标定位问题的仿真中，模块化方法性能优于联合状态滤波器，且在通信受限时表现稳健。

Conclusion: 模块化方法在多子系统状态估计中有效且灵活，适用于通信资源受限的场景。

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升控制性能，还增强了名义控制器对参数调整的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that combines the advantages of both
model-based and learning-based frameworks to achieve robust locomotion. The
residual modules are integrated with each corresponding part of the model-based
framework, a footstep planner and dynamic model designed using heuristics, to
complement performance degradation caused by a model mismatch. By utilizing a
modular structure and selecting the appropriate learning-based method for each
residual module, our framework demonstrates improved control performance in
environments with high uncertainty, while also achieving higher learning
efficiency compared to baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that our
proposed methodology not only enhances control performance but also provides
additional benefits, such as making nominal controllers more robust to
parameter tuning. To investigate the feasibility of our framework, we
demonstrated residual modules combined with model predictive control in a real
quadrupedal robot. Despite uncertainties beyond the simulation, the robot
successfully maintains balance and tracks the commanded velocity.

Conclusion: 系统具备实时搜救潜力，下一步将进行大规模无人机实验并整合GPS导航。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a subsystem, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
for search and rescue missions, focusing on people detection, face recognition
and tracking of identified individuals. The proposed solution integrates a UAV
with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system
parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to
estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.
The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that
the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step
involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and
integrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations
planning.

Result: 实验表明，MoRPI-PINN的导航精度比其他方法提高超过85%，且轻量级设计适用于边缘设备。

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN是一种高效、轻量的解决方案，适用于移动机器人在复杂环境中的精确导航。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

Result: 手术灯光下检测准确性提升，但大角度偏转时标准偏差增加。

Conclusion: MediaPipe算法在医疗程序中有潜在应用价值，但需解决标准偏差问题。

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

Result: 在丰富的家庭环境和稀疏的化学实验室环境中进行的实验表明，ReSem3D在零样本条件下能够完成多样化的操作任务，表现出强大的适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReSem3D通过结合VFMs和MLLMs的协同作用，显著提升了语义多样性环境中的机器人操作性能，为实时和动态任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

Method: 提出AdaRPG框架，利用基础模型提取部件并构建部件级功能标注数据集，生成高级控制代码调用功能技能。

Result: 仿真和真实实验表明AdaRPG在新关节物体类别中具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AdaRPG通过部件级功能推理和基础模型知识，实现了跨类别关节物体的自适应操纵。

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

Conclusion: AF-RLIO通过多传感器融合显著提升了复杂环境中的导航稳定性和安全性。

Abstract: In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in
complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges
such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the
performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the
overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges,
we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D
millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to
leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry
estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules.
Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in
removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are
degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects
appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it
with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor
graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data,
constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been
evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments,
demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in
challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel geometry-aware RGB-D Gaussian Splatting
SLAM system, named G2S-ICP SLAM. The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D
reconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing
each scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local
tangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk
aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth
interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D
ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this
representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian
disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance
prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we
propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal
consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that G2S-ICP SLAM outperforms prior SLAM systems
in terms of localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, while
maintaining the rendering quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种残差库普曼模型预测控制（RKMPC）框架，结合线性MPC和神经网络补偿输入，优化车辆轨迹跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统纯追踪控制和模型预测控制在车辆轨迹跟踪中因模型精度不足或计算效率低而导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用双线性MPC架构：基于车辆运动学模型的线性MPC计算基线输入，神经网络补偿输入；两者相加得到最终控制命令。

Result: 实验表明，RKMPC仅需传统KMPC 20%的训练数据，横向误差减少11.7%-22.1%，航向误差减少8.9%-15.8%，前轮转向稳定性提升27.6%。

Conclusion: RKMPC在保持传统模型可靠性的同时，通过残差建模实现性能优化，适用于车辆轨迹跟踪任务。

Abstract: In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure
Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy
fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control
actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its
control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.
Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between
capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often
resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.
This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a
Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input
based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC
calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by
adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and
interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance
optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the
Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH
racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the
training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)
while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC,
RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by
8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%. The
implementation code is available at: https://github.com/ZJU-DDRX/Residual

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种机器人辅助穿衣前的展开衣物步骤（pre-dressing），结合模仿学习和视觉分类器，评估了动态动作组合的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗环境中衣物通常折叠存放，现有研究假设衣物已展开，因此需要解决展开步骤以提高机器人辅助穿衣的效率。

Method: 利用模仿学习学习三种操作动作（包括高低加速度动作），并使用视觉分类器判断衣物状态（闭合、部分展开、完全展开）。

Result: 动态动作组合能有效提升展开效果，而高动态动作对刚拆封衣物的展开效果不佳。

Conclusion: 结合多种动作能高效完成衣物展开，为机器人辅助穿衣提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly aid both
patients as well as healthcare personnel, reducing the workload and improving
the efficiency in clinical settings. While substantial progress has been made
in robotic dressing assistance, prior works typically assume that garments are
already unfolded and ready for use. However, in medical applications gowns and
aprons are often stored in a folded configuration, requiring an additional
unfolding step. In this paper, we introduce the pre-dressing step, the process
of unfolding garments prior to assisted dressing. We leverage imitation
learning for learning three manipulation primitives, including both high and
low acceleration motions. In addition, we employ a visual classifier to
categorise the garment state as closed, partly opened, and fully opened. We
conduct an empirical evaluation of the learned manipulation primitives as well
as their combinations. Our results show that highly dynamic motions are not
effective for unfolding freshly unpacked garments, where the combination of
motions can efficiently enhance the opening configuration.

Abstract: In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a
technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements
than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous
robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular
tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including
measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,
this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into
how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design
optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We
propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement
matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the
signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is
the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying
transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the
number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution
maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce
robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while
improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to
traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by
a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)
methods.

Result: 实验结果表明，两种控制器在非理想条件下表现出不同的性能特点，各有优缺点。

Conclusion: 结论是两种控制器各有优势，需根据具体应用场景选择合适的控制方法。

Abstract: This paper studies the experimental comparison of two different whole-body
control formulations for humanoid robots: inverse dynamics whole-body control
(ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC). The two controllers
fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task
acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity
considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal
conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction,
sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact
conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the
two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and
orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights,
and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic
differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's
advantages and disadvantages.

TL;DR: QuaRC框架通过核心集选择和级联层校正策略，在边缘设备上高效进行量化感知训练，显著提升低比特量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上低比特量化模型的需求增加，但隐私问题限制了数据使用，传统QAT计算成本高，现有核心集方法在小规模数据集上性能下降。

Method: 提出QuaRC框架，包括基于相对熵评分的核心集选择和级联层校正策略，以减少量化误差。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，2-bit量化的ResNet-18使用1%数据子集时，Top-1准确率提升5.72%。

Conclusion: QuaRC有效解决了边缘设备上量化模型训练中的性能和隐私问题。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: 因果不变知识确保跨设备一致性，分类任务表现优异，数据重建PSNR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义通信中表现出高效、鲁棒的数据重建能力，适用于多样化数据场景。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Motivation: LLM在排序和评估任务中存在位置偏差和重复一致性低的问题，传统重复调用方法计算成本高。

Method: 引入动态早停方法，根据实例需求自适应确定重复次数，并提出基于置信度的改进。

Result: 动态策略平均减少81%的LLM调用，置信度改进后减少87%，准确性损失小。

Conclusion: 动态早停方法有效减少计算成本，适用于不同规模和任务的LLM。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Conclusion: CICME通过结合全局和个体领域数据，有效提升了因果机制推断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Motivation: 现有预测方法在不同城市环境中的适应性不足，且因个人流量模式的高不确定性和环境上下文缺失导致预测不准确。

Method: 结合扩散模型的生成能力和Transformer的自适应学习能力，利用LLM捕捉多模态环境信息。

Conclusion: LSDM在移动流量预测中表现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性，为网络效率和服务质量提升提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（点对点或成对比较）未能充分利用LLM的比较能力或在大规模采样时效率低下。

Method: 提出GenSelect方法，通过LLM的长推理从多个候选方案中选择最佳方案。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，GenSelect表现优于现有评分方法。

Conclusion: GenSelect有效结合了LLM的比较优势和高效率的并行采样扩展能力。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）进行降水降尺度，生成视觉真实的降水场，并通过批评器评分评估数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率降水预测对减少局部强降雨灾害至关重要，但传统数值天气预报模型在此方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用WGAN进行降水降尺度，利用最优传输成本生成降水场，并与传统均方误差训练的神经网络对比。

Result: WGAN生成的降水场视觉更真实，尽管在传统评估指标上表现略低，批评器评分与人类感知真实性相关。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提升降水降尺度的感知真实性，还为降水数据集评估和质量控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的‘黑盒’特性及其难以捕捉节点间复杂交互模式的问题。

Method: 利用合作博弈理论和社会外部性，将节点分组成联盟，分解子图，并通过Shapley值量化节点重要性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，GraphEXT在多种GNN架构中表现优于基线方法，显著提升了模型解释性。

Conclusion: GraphEXT通过强调节点交互和结构变化对预测的影响，有效提升了GNN的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

TL;DR: 提出分子任务算术方法，通过负样本训练生成正向分子，无需正向数据，实验显示其多样性和性能优于传统方法。

Result: 在20个零样本实验中，生成更多样且成功的分子设计，双目标和少样本任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 分子任务算术因其简单、高效和性能，有望成为分子设计的标准迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Conclusion: MFNO在理论和实证上均表现出色，为随机系统动态学习提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Motivation: 探讨公开数据和私有数据在分布偏移情况下的互补价值，填补现有理论空白。

Method: 扩展了现有的下限理论，针对高斯均值估计和线性回归中的分布偏移进行分析。

Result: 发现偏移较小时，公开或私有数据需足够多；偏移较大时，公开数据无益。

Conclusion: 分布偏移大小决定了公开数据在差分隐私学习中的价值。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Result: FL为云机器人操作提供了灵活性和可靠性，但也面临效率和可扩展性等挑战。

Conclusion: FL在云机器人操作中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以解决实际应用中的问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过减少计算成本的方法，高效生成具有特定水力特性的多孔超材料。

Method: 结合变分自编码器（VAE）和回归器，利用卷积神经网络（CNN）预测水力特性，并通过潜在空间实现结构-属性映射。

Result: pVAE框架成功生成了具有定制特性的新材料，并显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为多孔超材料的逆向设计提供了高效工具，并支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Motivation: 解释SOTA神经网络的性能，并验证HTSR理论中的关键量。

Method: 结合统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学方法，推导出新的学习数学前提条件（如ERG指标），并在3层MLP和SOTA NNs上验证。

Result: SETOL理论与实验数据高度吻合，HTSR的alpha和SETOL的ERG指标在MLP和SOTA NNs上表现一致。

Conclusion: SETOL为神经网络性能提供了理论解释，并提出了新的学习指标ERG，与HTSR理论一致。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对抗性提示生成方法存在人类生成规模小、机器生成缺乏真实性的问题，需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出Seed2Harvest方法，通过引导扩展人类生成的对抗性提示种子，结合机器计算能力生成多样化提示。

Result: 生成的提示集具有更高的多样性（535个地理位置，香农熵7.48）和可比的攻击成功率（0.31-0.36）。

Conclusion: 人机协作在文本到图像模型安全评估中至关重要，Seed2Harvest展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Result: 在高仿真Gazebo环境中表现优于传统方法，适应性强。

Conclusion: ARBoids框架在拦截任务中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)
concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target
region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario
arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the
defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this
challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual
reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this
framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline
policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to
adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is
validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating
superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure
force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned
policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability
profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code
of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse通过高效迁移学习，为高分辨率AI城市预测在多样化城市中的实际部署迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Method: MFTRR将帖子质量评估重构为排序任务，包含两个关键模块：局部-全局语义关联推理模块和多层次证据关系推理模块。

Result: 在三个新构建的多模态数据集和公开数据集上，MFTRR显著优于现有方法，NDCG@3指标最高提升9.52%。

Conclusion: MFTRR通过多模态细粒度推理，有效提升了帖子质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗等领域的表格数据偏移问题，同时满足隐私保护和去噪需求。

Method: SIFOTL方法包括提取隐私合规统计摘要、使用双XGBoost模型和LLM辅助去噪，并通过Pareto加权决策树合并输出。

Result: 在MEPS数据集上F1得分为0.85，优于基线方法；在18个EHR数据集上F1得分稳定在0.86-0.96（无噪声）和≥0.75（有噪声）。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种可解释、隐私保护且对噪声鲁棒的工作流程。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of

Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式TSEP-Machine Unlearning，旨在解决交通状态估计与预测中隐私、数据安全和数据新鲜度问题，通过选择性遗忘敏感数据提升模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的交通状态估计与预测（TSEP）依赖敏感数据，但隐私、网络安全和数据新鲜度问题可能削弱公众对智能交通系统的信任。

Method: 提出TSEP-Machine Unlearning范式，使训练后的TSEP模型能够选择性遗忘隐私敏感、被污染或过时的数据。

Result: 通过选择性遗忘，提升数据驱动TSEP的可信度和可靠性。

Conclusion: TSEP-Machine Unlearning为解决TSEP中的隐私和数据安全问题提供了有效方法，增强了模型的信任度。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种预测框架，用于优化基于GRPO的大型语言模型微调的资源使用，通过实验总结出奖励轨迹的规律，并建议提前停止训练以减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型（LLMs）进行推理任务的计算成本高昂，需要优化资源使用。

Method: 提出预测框架，建模训练动态，并通过实验在Llama和Qwen模型上验证，总结出基于模型规模、初始性能和训练进度的经验缩放规律。

Result: 识别出三个一致的训练阶段（缓慢启动、快速提升、平台期），并发现超过一定训练轮次后收益甚微。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到不同模型类型，为基于GRPO的高效微调提供实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率海洋数据对沿海管理、环境监测和海上安全至关重要，但现有卫星数据（如Copernicus）和全球海洋模型的空间分辨率不足。

Method: 采用监督深度学习框架，基于神经算子解决偏微分方程，并提出降尺度模型应用于Copernicus海洋数据。

Result: 模型在真实Copernicus海洋数据和合成Navier-Stokes模拟数据集上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该方法能够建模替代偏微分方程，并在任意输入分辨率下预测解。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

TL;DR: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器和ADPCM技术，有效保护可穿戴设备数据的隐私，同时保持活动识别性能，并减少数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的加速度计和陀螺仪数据可能泄露用户身份，隐私保护在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器（AAE）和自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM），先通过AAE提取活动特征并抑制身份信息，再用ADPCM进一步隐藏身份并压缩数据。

Result: 在MotionSense和PAMAP2数据集上，C-AAE将用户重识别F1分数降低10-15%，活动识别F1分数保持在未保护基线的5%以内，数据量减少约75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE在医疗传感器数据中实现了隐私保护和实用性的平衡。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM是一种分阶段混合精度的后训练量化框架，通过将80%的权重量化为1位、20%为4位，平均每权重1.6位，显著减少存储和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）部署因参数庞大和计算成本高而具有挑战性，极端压缩（如平均位宽≤2）通常导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出Squeeze10-LLM框架，包含Post-Binarization Activation Robustness（PBAR）和Full Information Activation Supervision（FIAS）两项创新，PBAR改进权重重要性度量，FIAS保留激活信息以减少误差传播。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2上实验显示，Squeeze10-LLM在子2位权重量化中达到最先进性能，零样本分类任务平均准确率从43%提升至56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM通过混合精度量化和创新方法，显著提升了低比特量化下的模型性能。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练数据有限的情况下，如何利用额外的监督信息（如置信度）提升分类模型的准确性是一个关键问题。

Method: 将硬标签和额外监督视为概率分布，通过它们的仿射组合构建软标签，并分析其对泛化性能的影响。

Result: 理论分析表明，额外监督的核心是非硬标签类别的分布信息，而非硬标签的置信度。实验证明该方法能提升分类准确性。

Conclusion: 额外监督和混合系数在软标签优化中起互补作用，合理设计额外监督可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Method: 基于大数定律设计奖励函数，提出PDA-DRL算法，并引入基于性能的个性化模型共享机制。

Result: PDA-DRL比基线方法平均延迟降低38%，个性化模型共享优于传统聚合方法。

Conclusion: PDA-DRL在资源分配和延迟优化方面表现优异，个性化模型共享提升了多MVNO场景的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Motivation: 现实数据集中噪声标签会影响深度神经网络的泛化性能，现有方法未能充分利用学习过程中的时序动态信息。

Result: 理论证明框架在噪声条件下的收敛性和稳定性，实验验证其在合成和真实数据集上的先进性能。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect通过动态时序分析显著提升了噪声标签下的学习效果，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 在跨数据集评估中（Argoverse2训练，NuScenes测试）验证了目标选择过程的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型在未知场景中的泛化性能。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Motivation: 现有FGL方法依赖同步通信效率低，而异步联邦学习方法未考虑图数据的拓扑特性，可能导致语义漂移和表示不一致。

Method: 提出FedSA-GCL框架，结合客户端间标签分布差异和图拓扑特性，利用ClusterCast机制进行高效训练。

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL在效率和鲁棒性上表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Motivation: 尽管基于线性规划的完全校正提升方法在理论上具有吸引力，但其在实证研究中关注有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在20个多样化数据集上评估了六种LP提升方法，包括NM-Boost和QRLP-Boost，并比较了启发式和最优基学习器的使用。

Result: 完全校正方法在浅层树时表现优于或匹配XGBoost和LightGBM，且能生成更稀疏的集成模型，还能在不牺牲性能的情况下精简预训练集成。

Conclusion: 完全校正方法在特定场景下具有优势，但使用最优决策树时存在局限性。

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实事件日志的低变异性和小规模限制了深度学习在预测过程监控中的应用。

Method: 提出SiamSA-PPM框架，结合Siamese学习和统计增强，利用三种基于控制流语义和频繁行为模式的转换方法生成新轨迹变体。

Result: 在真实事件日志上的实验表明，SiamSA-PPM在下一活动和最终结果预测任务中表现优于或与现有技术相当，统计增强显著优于随机转换。

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM为过程预测中的数据增强提供了一种有前景的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Motivation: 恶意软件快速演变，传统全量重训练不现实，持续学习成为替代方案，但安全回归问题（如已检测到的恶意软件在更新后逃逸）被忽视，可能威胁系统安全。

Method: 通过形式化和量化安全回归，提出回归感知惩罚方法，并调整Positive Congruent Training（PCT）以适应持续学习场景。

Result: 在ELSA、Tesseract和AZ-Class数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减少回归，同时保持检测性能。

Conclusion: 回归感知方法能显著降低安全回归风险，提升持续学习在恶意软件检测中的可靠性。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

Result: 在NASA数据集上，TIDSIT将预测误差降低50%以上，SoH误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT在电池健康监测中表现优异，且适用于其他不规则时间序列任务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法依赖简单约定而非有效信号恢复，并通过案例研究揭示其脆弱性，呼吁设计更合理的测试环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前MARL算法在Dec-POMDP框架下的局限性，尤其是其依赖简单约定而非真实推理的问题。

Method: 通过案例研究分析智能体在合作任务中的行为，揭示其学习到的约定在非适应性伙伴下的脆弱性。

Result: 研究发现智能体可以学习到脆弱的约定，但也能在任务设计合理时学习到基于观察的策略。

Conclusion: 提出需要设计新的测试环境，强调基于观察和记忆的真实推理能力，而非依赖脆弱约定。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Motivation: HyperDeepONets虽提升了表达能力，但因其高内存和计算成本而受限。

Method: 引入PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets，利用LoRA将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵，减少参数并正则化主干网络权重。

Result: 在常微分和偏微分方程实验中，PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets参数减少70%，预测精度和泛化能力优于常规HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets在降低复杂度的同时提升了性能，适用于物理信息机器学习。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLMs在不确定性量化方面存在挑战，传统方法计算成本高，需多次前向传播。

Method: 通过蒸馏技术将需要多次前向传播的教师模型压缩为学生模型，使用LoRA微调，并比较了两种输出策略（softmax和Dirichlet分布）。

Result: 实验表明，学生模型在单次前向传播下能达到与教师模型相当或更好的预测和不确定性量化性能。

Conclusion: 首次证明通过证据蒸馏可在LLMs中实现即时且鲁棒的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

Motivation: 许多地区缺乏足够的河流流量观测数据，限制了降雨-径流分析的准确性，现有模型在数据稀缺条件下难以同时满足高精度、可解释性和计算效率。

Method: HYPER结合贝叶斯模型平均（BMA）和储层计算（RC），通过线性回归校正BMA输出误差，适用于无测站流域。

Result: 在日本87个流域的测试中，HYPER在数据丰富和数据稀缺条件下均表现优异，计算效率显著高于LSTM基准模型。

Conclusion: HYPER为无测站流域提供了一种高效、稳健且可推广的流量预测解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Conclusion: 改进的双仿真度量在理论和实验上均表现出优越性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Conclusion: GLANCE为异质图提供了轻量、适应性强且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Motivation: 揭示不同学习算法、优化方法和自然选择背后的共同数学结构，为理解和设计跨学科的学习算法提供理论基础。

Conclusion: FMB定律为跨学科的学习算法提供了统一的理论框架，有助于理解和设计新的算法。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Conclusion: GPTQ的理论基础得到巩固，为未来量化算法的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理空间数据在自动驾驶任务中至关重要，现有方法因显式计算所有对象对的相对位姿而需要二次内存，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种SE(2)不变性的缩放点积注意力机制，仅需线性内存，并基于此构建了SE(2)不变性Transformer架构。

Result: 实验证明该方法易于实现，且性能优于非不变性架构。

Conclusion: 该SE(2)不变性Transformer架构具有线性内存需求，为自动驾驶任务提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了模型和评估指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 新框架和评估指标为功能导向的蛋白质设计提供了高效可靠的方法。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决物理约束下人机协作的复杂性，如连续状态-动作空间和受限动态。

Method: 提出了BASS方法（行为增强、模拟和选择），通过增强行为多样性和理解动作结果来应对挑战。

Result: 实验表明，BASS在AI-AI和人机协作中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结论是Moving Out基准和BASS方法有效提升了AI在物理环境中的协作能力。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Abstract: This project presents the development of a gait recognition system using Tiny
Machine Learning (Tiny ML) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The
system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.
