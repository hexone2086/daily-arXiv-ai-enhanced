### [1] [Med-GRIM: Enhanced Zero-Shot Medical VQA using prompt-embedded Multimodal Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06496)
*Rakesh Raj Madavan,Akshat Kaimal,Hashim Faisal,Chandrakala S*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIND和Med-GRIM通过密集编码和图检索改进医疗VQA任务，减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在复杂领域（如医疗）中缺乏精确性，需改进。

Method: BIND通过密集编码优化嵌入空间；Med-GRIM结合图检索和提示工程，使用小语言模型。

Result: Med-GRIM以低计算成本实现高性能，并发布DermaGraph数据集支持研究。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，适用于零样本医疗应用。

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

### [2] [DiTalker: A Unified DiT-based Framework for High-Quality and Speaking Styles Controllable Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06511)
*He Feng,Yongjia Ma,Donglin Di,Lei Fan,Tonghua Su,Xiangqian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTalker提出了一种基于DiT的统一框架，用于控制说话风格的肖像动画，解决了现有方法在动态风格（如头部运动）上的不足，并通过模块化设计优化了同步和细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的肖像动画方法主要关注唇同步或静态情感转换，忽略了动态风格（如头部运动），且双U-Net架构增加了计算开销。DiTalker旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DiTalker设计了风格-情感编码模块（分别提取身份相关风格和身份无关情感特征）和音频-风格融合模块（通过并行交叉注意力层解耦音频与说话风格），并采用优化约束提升唇同步和细节保留。

Result: 实验表明DiTalker在唇同步和说话风格可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiTalker通过模块化设计和优化约束，实现了高质量的动态风格可控肖像动画。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

### [3] [BigTokDetect: A Clinically-Informed Vision-Language Model Framework for Detecting Pro-Bigorexia Videos on TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06515)
*Minh Duc Chu,Kshitij Pawar,Zihao He,Roxanna Sharifi,Ross Sonnenblick,Magdalayna Curry,Laura D'Adamo,Lindsay Young,Stuart B Murray,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BigTokDetect框架，用于检测TikTok上促进肌肉畸形的有害内容，通过多模态方法显著提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体难以检测伪装成健身内容的肌肉畸形行为宣传，传统文本检测方法效果有限。

Method: 开发BigTokDetect框架，使用专家标注的多模态数据集BigTok，结合视觉语言模型进行检测。

Result: 多模态融合方法比纯文本检测性能提升5-10%，视频特征最具区分性，分类准确率达82.9%。

Conclusion: 该研究为心理健康领域的有害内容检测提供了新工具和方法框架。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

### [4] [Frequency Prior Guided Matching: A Data Augmentation Approach for Generalizable Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06517)
*Haoran Xi,Chen Liu,Xiaolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM是一种基于频率先验的半监督学习框架，通过利用息肉边缘的频率特征提升跨域分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决息肉分割中标注数据有限和跨域性能下降的问题。

Method: FPGM通过两阶段过程：学习域不变频率先验，并对未标注图像进行频谱扰动以对齐频率特征。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上优于十种方法，零样本泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: FPGM为临床部署提供了高效的息肉分割解决方案。

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

### [5] [Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525)
*Guoyuan An,JaeYoon Kim,SungEui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型多模态模型（LMMs）中视觉反射的可解释性，发现通过提示LMM验证专用视觉模型的预测可提高识别精度，并分析了视觉反射的内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示LMMs在视觉任务中的表现机制，探索如何通过视觉反射提升其识别能力和可解释性。

Method: 通过实验验证LMMs在视觉任务中的表现，分析视觉-语言连接器的工作原理，并测试无训练连接器在细粒度识别任务中的效果。

Result: 发现LMMs通过将视觉特征映射为文本概念进行推理，且依赖少量文本表示而非原始视觉特征；无训练连接器可提升细粒度识别性能。

Conclusion: 视觉反射是提升LMMs识别能力和可解释性的有效策略，为视觉-语言模型的研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

### [6] [A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528)
*Xiuliang Zhang,Tadiwa Elisha Nyamasvisva,Chuntao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D CNN和Transformer的混合框架，用于视频行为识别，解决了传统方法在长程依赖和高计算成本上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频行为识别在公共安全、智能监控等领域至关重要，但传统3D CNN难以建模长程依赖，而Transformer计算成本高。

Method: 混合框架中，3D CNN提取低级时空特征，Transformer捕获长程时间依赖，并通过融合机制整合两者。

Result: 在基准数据集上，该模型优于传统3D CNN和单独Transformer，识别精度更高且复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 混合框架为视频行为识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要高精度和实时性的全景驾驶感知，现有方法在多任务处理中存在负迁移和标签不一致问题。

Method: 提出RMT-PPAD模型，采用门控适配器融合共享和任务特定特征，设计自适应分割解码器自动学习多尺度特征权重，并解决车道线分割中的标签不一致问题。

Result: 在BDD100K数据集上，目标检测mAP50为84.9%，召回率95.4%；可行驶区域分割mIoU为92.6%；车道线分割IoU为56.8%，准确率84.7%；推理速度32.6 FPS。

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD在性能和实时性上均达到先进水平，并通过实际场景验证了稳定性，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at
https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

### [8] [What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06530)
*Ming-Kun Xie,Jia-Hao Xiao,Gang Niu,Lei Feng,Zhiqiang Kou,Min-Ling Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了HOPE基准测试，用于更严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的幻觉问题，相比现有POPE基准，HOPE通过内容感知和描述性搜索生成更具误导性的干扰项，显著提升了评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POPE基准在评估LVLMs的幻觉问题时效果逐渐减弱，因其采样策略过于简单且忽视图像特定信息，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: HOPE通过内容感知幻觉搜索（利用CLIP选择高预测可能性的负样本）和描述性幻觉搜索（配对真实对象与错误描述）生成误导性干扰项。

Result: 实验显示，HOPE使多种先进LVLMs的精度下降9%至23%，显著优于POPE。

Conclusion: HOPE是一种更有效的评估LVLMs幻觉问题的基准测试，能够更全面地暴露模型的弱点。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了常见目标检测模型在稀疏天体摄影数据集MobilTelesco上的表现，揭示了特征不足条件下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测模型基于日常物体数据集（如ImageNet、COCO等），缺乏对稀疏信号（如天体摄影）的适应性。

Method: 使用智能手机拍摄的稀疏天体图像数据集MobilTelesco，对多种目标检测模型进行基准测试。

Result: 在特征不足条件下，现有模型表现不佳，揭示了新的挑战。

Conclusion: 需要开发更适合稀疏信号的目标检测模型。

Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet,
COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack
signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

### [10] [MILD: Multi-Layer Diffusion Strategy for Complex and Precise Multi-IP Aware Human Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06543)
*Jinghan Yu,Zhiyuan Ma,Yue Ma,Kaiqi Liu,Yuhan Wang,Jianjun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MILD的新方法，用于解决复杂多实例场景下的人像擦除问题，通过多层扩散和空间解耦技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多实例场景（如人-人遮挡、人-物体纠缠和背景干扰）中表现不佳，主要由于数据集限制和缺乏空间解耦能力。

Method: 提出Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD)策略，将生成过程分解为语义分离的路径，并引入Human Morphology Guidance和Spatially-Modulated Attention。

Result: MILD在挑战性的人像擦除基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MILD通过数据集和方法的创新，有效解决了复杂场景下的人像擦除问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

*Qi Xun Yeo,Yanyan Li,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用多视角RGB图像进行3D语义场景图估计的方法，通过语义掩码和邻域信息增强特征，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏3D标注数据的情况下，探索如何仅利用多视角RGB图像实现准确的3D语义场景图估计。

Method: 利用语义掩码过滤背景噪声，设计新方法结合邻域节点信息，并利用统计先验优化节点和边的预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仅使用多视角图像作为输入时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义和空间信息增强特征，结合邻域关系和统计先验，实现了高效的3D场景图估计。

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our
project page is available at https://qixun1.github.io/projects/SCRSSG.

### [12] [Slice or the Whole Pie? Utility Control for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551)
*Ye Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNObfuscator是一种新型的实用控制机制，允许AI模型根据预设条件动态调整性能，避免了为不同用户需求训练多个模型的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中为满足不同用户需求需训练多个模型的资源浪费和维护困难问题。

Method: 提出NNObfuscator机制，使单个模型能实时调整性能，支持分层访问控制。

Result: 实验验证了NNObfuscator在多种任务（如图像分类、语义分割等）中的有效性，单个模型可适应广泛需求。

Conclusion: NNObfuscator提高了资源分配效率，减少了不必要计算，支持可持续的AI部署商业模式。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

Result: 实验表明，基于新数据集的模型在年龄组间表现更公平，整体准确率和泛化能力均有提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为公平的深度伪造检测提供了可复现的数据集和模型流程，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment.
Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for
personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs
are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback
spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy.
Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop
mechanism that enhances recommendation quality.To assess the performance, we
introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency,
visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized
designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative
feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化的标签错误修正框架REC✓D，通过结合现有检测器和众包微任务，系统性修正目标检测数据集中的标签错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测数据集中标签错误（如缺失标签、分类错误或定位不准确）会影响训练和评估效果，但目前缺乏系统性修正方法。

Method: REC✓D框架结合现有错误检测器和众包微任务，通过多标注者独立验证候选边界框，聚合响应以估计模糊性并提升标签质量。

Result: 在KITTI数据集的“行人”类中应用REC✓D，发现原始标注中至少24%的缺失和不准确标注，并生成高质量修正标注。

Conclusion: REC✓D框架能高效修正标签错误，但现有方法仍会遗漏大量错误，需进一步研究。修正后的数据集将作为新基准发布。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态特权知识蒸馏（MMPKD）方法，利用训练时额外的模态数据指导单模态视觉模型，提升注意力图的零样本能力，但效果不跨域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中部署深度学习模型常需多模态数据，但推理时并非所有模态都可用，需利用训练时的额外模态提升模型性能。

Method: 提出MMPKD策略，基于文本和表格元数据的教师模型（分别用于胸片和乳腺X光片）向视觉Transformer学生模型蒸馏知识。

Result: MMPKD提升了注意力图的零样本定位能力，但效果不跨域。

Conclusion: MMPKD能有效利用训练时的额外模态提升单模态模型性能，但跨域泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VEGA机制通过心理学理论和多感官整合提升了多模态情感识别的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

TL;DR: Surformer v1是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于结合视觉和触觉输入进行表面材料分类，在准确性和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面材料识别是机器人感知和物理交互的关键，尤其是在结合视觉和触觉输入时。

Method: 提出Surformer v1，结合结构化触觉特征和PCA降维的视觉嵌入，使用模态特定编码器和跨模态注意力层。

Result: Surformer v1在准确率（99.4%）和推理时间（0.77 ms）上表现优异，优于多模态CNN。

Conclusion: Surformer v1在表面材料识别中提供了准确性和效率的平衡，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ContextGuard-LVLM框架，利用增强学习改进视觉语言大模型，解决跨模态细粒度一致性（FCCC）问题，显著优于现有零样本基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字新闻媒体激增需要验证内容真实性，传统方法难以解决视觉与文本的细粒度一致性（FCCC）问题。

Method: 基于视觉语言大模型（LVLM），结合多阶段上下文推理机制，通过增强或对抗学习提升模型能力。

Result: ContextGuard-LVLM在细粒度一致性任务中表现优异，尤其在复杂逻辑推理和上下文理解上显著提升，且对扰动更鲁棒。

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM能有效识别复杂上下文脱节，优于现有零样本基线，适用于真实场景中的内容验证。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Conclusion: VL-MedGuide提供了高清晰度、完整性和可信度的解释，提升了AI在皮肤病临床实践中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence
of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates
diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

Conclusion: 该分解范式为神经场景表示中复杂外观建模提供了灵活有效的方向。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

Conclusion: CausalNet通过结合完整序列输入和因果学习，显著提升了微表情识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising method that modulates
user-defined waveforms with digital holograms. An efficient and fast pipeline
framework is proposed to synthesize CGH using initial point cloud and MRI data.
This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input

and quasi-Netwton methods. Comparison of reconstruction performance of these
algorithms as measured by MSE, RMSE, and PSNR is analyzed as well as to HoloNet
deep learning CGH. Performance metrics are shown to be improved by using 2D
median filtering to remove artifacts and speckled noise during optimization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Restage4D的方法，通过利用真实视频的运动先验，生成物理一致的4D内容，解决了生成模型在物理真实性和运动动态性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像和图像到视频生成模型在语义外观上表现良好，但缺乏物理真实性和运动动态性。真实视频提供了物理基础的几何和运动线索，因此论文探索如何利用这些线索生成物理一致的4D内容。

Method: Restage4D是一种几何保持的流程，通过视频重放训练策略，将真实基础视频和合成驱动视频通过共享运动表示连接起来。此外，还引入了遮挡感知的刚性损失和遮挡回溯机制，以提升结构和几何一致性。

Result: 在DAVIS和PointOdyssey数据集上的实验表明，Restage4D在几何一致性、运动质量和3D跟踪性能上均有提升。

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统侵入性方法无法捕捉肿瘤的空间异质性，且深度学习模型因标注数据稀缺而受限。

Method: 采用SWIN-UNETR架构，结合Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding（TAFE）和Cross-Modality Differential（CMD）模块，从多参数MRI中提取特征。

Result: 在多个独立测试集上AUC达65.41%-90.58%，显著优于基线方法（p <= 0.05）。

Conclusion: FoundBioNet通过大规模预训练和任务微调，提高了胶质瘤诊断的准确性和可解释性，有望实现个性化治疗。

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视频基准数据集VOccl3D，用于解决现有3D人体姿态和形状估计方法在复杂遮挡场景下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂姿态或严重遮挡情况下表现不佳，且现有数据集缺乏真实遮挡场景。

Method: 通过计算机图形渲染技术构建VOccl3D数据集，并微调HPS方法CLIFF和BEDLAM-CLIFF，以及YOLO11检测器。

Result: 在多个公共数据集和VOccl3D测试集上，方法表现出显著提升。

Conclusion: VOccl3D为未来研究提供了更真实的遮挡场景基准。

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

Result: 实验表明，SafePLUG在区域问答、像素级分割、时间事件定位和事故理解等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SafePLUG为复杂交通场景的细粒度理解奠定基础，有望提升智能交通系统的安全性和情境感知能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

Result: 在ReMIND数据集上验证了DiffUS从脑MRI生成解剖学准确超声图像的能力。

Conclusion: DiffUS为术中导航提供了高质量的超声模拟工具，支持下游优化任务。

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

Conclusion: 该方法生成的精确边缘图能有效提升医学图像任务的性能，具有临床价值。

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Motivation: 解决多源域自适应（MSDA）方法中参数和计算成本高的问题，同时保持高准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 训练源特定的低秩适配器（LoRA），并通过轻量级门控网络动态融合这些适配器。

Result: 在Market-1501、DukeMTMC-reID和MSMT17等基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: SAGE-reID是一种高效、低成本的MSDA方法，适用于人员重识别任务。

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision
remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a
methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling
research.

Motivation: 多视图聚类（MC）旨在利用不同视图的一致和互补信息对样本进行分组，而子空间聚类作为MC的基础技术，需要更有效的方法来提取局部和全局结构信息。

Method: 提出了一种联合稀疏自表示学习模型，使用基数约束（ℓ0范数）替代图拉普拉斯正则化，提取视图特定局部信息，并通过低秩约束揭示全局一致结构。采用交替二次惩罚（AQP）方法解决非凸非光滑模型的收敛问题。

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型噪声抑制特征金字塔网络（NS-FPN），通过低频引导特征净化（LFP）和螺旋感知特征采样（SFS）模块，显著减少红外小目标检测中的误报问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测因目标暗淡、形状模糊及背景干扰严重而具有挑战性，现有CNN方法虽能增强特征表示但导致误报增加。

Method: NS-FPN结合LFP模块（抑制噪声）和SFS模块（螺旋采样融合目标相关特征），轻量且易集成。

Result: 在公开数据集上实验表明，NS-FPN显著减少误报并提升性能。

Conclusion: NS-FPN通过噪声抑制和特征融合，有效解决了红外小目标检测中的误报问题。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

*Jianting Tang,Yubo Wang,Haoyu Cao,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BASIC方法，通过直接视觉监督优化视觉嵌入，提升多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将视觉嵌入作为上下文线索，缺乏直接视觉监督，限制了视觉嵌入的精细对齐。

Method: BASIC利用LLM浅层中精炼的视觉嵌入作为监督，从嵌入方向和语义匹配两个角度优化初始视觉嵌入。

Result: BASIC显著提升了MLLM在多个基准测试中的性能，无需额外监督模型或人工标注。

Conclusion: 直接视觉监督是提升视觉嵌入对齐的有效方法，BASIC展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of
generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we
conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches
based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research
background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了eMotions数据集和AV-CANet模型，用于短视频情感分析，解决了多模态复杂性和情感表达不一致的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频情感分析面临多模态复杂性和数据不足的挑战，需要高质量数据集和有效模型。

Method: 提出eMotions数据集和多阶段标注流程，设计AV-CANet网络和EP-CE Loss，结合局部-全局特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了AV-CANet的有效性，并通过消融实验分析了关键组件。

Conclusion: AV-CANet为短视频情感分析提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的实例感知提示框架（IAPF），通过多模态大语言模型和区域约束点提示生成精细实例掩码，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有训练免费COS方法因语义级提示导致掩码粗糙、无法处理多离散实例的问题。

Method: IAPF框架包含文本提示生成器、实例掩码生成器和自一致性投票，结合MLLM和Grounding DINO生成精细实例掩码。

Result: 在标准COS基准测试中显著优于现有训练免费方法。

Conclusion: IAPF通过实例级提示和自一致性投票，首次实现了无需训练的精细COS预测。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiRef-bench评估框架，用于多视觉参考图像生成任务，发现现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成框架主要依赖单源输入，无法满足设计师从多视觉参考中获取灵感的需求。

Method: 引入MultiRef-bench评估框架，包含合成和真实样本，并构建MultiRef数据集。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进模型（如OmniGen）在多参考条件下表现有限，合成样本准确率66.6%，真实样本79.0%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更灵活、类人的创意工具提供了方向，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行人重识别模型在多模态数据（如RGB、热成像、红外、素描等）中泛化能力差，而现有方法未充分利用MLLMs的推理和跨模态理解能力。

Method: 引入MMReID-Bench基准，包含20,710个多模态查询和库图像，覆盖10种行人重识别任务，评估MLLMs的性能。

Result: 实验证明MLLMs在行人重识别中表现优异，但在处理热成像和红外数据时存在局限。

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench有望推动开发更鲁棒和通用的多模态基础模型。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成任务多关注单轮场景，难以处理迭代式、多轮创意任务，且单代理系统容易导致意图漂移和编辑不连贯。

Method: Talk2Image通过三个关键组件实现：对话历史的意图解析、任务分解与专业代理协作执行，以及基于多视角评估机制的反馈驱动优化。

Result: 实验表明，Talk2Image在可控性、连贯性和用户满意度方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Talk2Image在多轮图像生成和编辑任务中实现了逐步对齐用户意图和一致的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large

training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

TL;DR: CannyEdit是一种无需训练的图像编辑框架，通过选择性Canny控制和双提示引导，平衡文本遵从性和上下文保真度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编辑区域文本遵从性、未编辑区域上下文保真度及编辑无缝性方面存在不足。

Method: 采用选择性Canny控制（保留未编辑区域细节）和双提示引导（结合局部和全局提示）。

Result: 在真实图像编辑任务中，CannyEdit在文本遵从性和上下文保真度平衡上提升2.93%至10.49%，用户研究中仅49.2%普通用户和42.0%专家能识别其AI编辑痕迹。

Conclusion: CannyEdit通过创新方法显著提升了图像编辑的质量和自然度。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCOPE的新方法，通过动态增强空间域中的细节和语义特征，解决了频率域方法在细粒度视觉分类中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频率域方法基于固定基函数，缺乏对图像内容的适应性，无法动态调整特征提取。SCOPE旨在突破这一限制。

Method: SCOPE包含两个模块：Subtle Detail Extractor（SDE）动态增强浅层细节，Salient Semantic Refiner（SSR）学习高层语义特征。两者级联结合局部细节与全局语义。

Result: 在四个流行的细粒度图像分类基准测试中，SCOPE达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过动态增强多尺度特征，显著提升了细粒度视觉分类的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2VR攻击主要关注降低视频排名，而提升视频排名的攻击未被充分研究，这种攻击可能带来更大的经济利益和传播（错误）信息的风险。

Method: 提出Video Promotion攻击（ViPro）和Modal Refinement（MoRe）方法，通过细粒度模态交互增强攻击的黑盒迁移性。

Result: ViPro在白盒、灰盒和黑盒场景下平均分别优于基线方法30%、10%和4%。

Conclusion: ViPro揭示了T2VR的潜在漏洞，提供了攻击的上下界分析，并为防御措施提供了参考。

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at

Conclusion: ForeSight通过联合学习和无跟踪设计，显著提升了3D感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

### [58] [Evaluating Fisheye-Compatible 3D Gaussian Splatting Methods on Real Images Beyond 180 Degree Field of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06968)
*Ulas Gunes,Matias Turkulainen,Juho Kannala,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文首次评估了基于鱼眼镜头的3D高斯泼溅方法Fisheye-GS和3DGUT在真实图像中的表现，覆盖了超过180度视场的场景，并分析了极端畸变的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索鱼眼镜头在3D重建中的潜力，尤其是在极端畸变和稀疏输入条件下的实际应用。

Method: 通过不同视场（200、160、120度）评估性能，提出基于UniK3D预测的深度初始化策略以解决SfM在强畸变下的失效问题。

Result: Fisheye-GS在160度视场表现最佳，3DGUT在200度下保持稳定且高质量。UniK3D策略在困难场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 鱼眼3DGS方法在宽角度3D重建中具有实际可行性，适用于稀疏和畸变严重的输入。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试和真实实验中表现领先，尤其在少样本场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式模仿人类动作能有效提升视觉机器人操作的性能，尤其在数据稀缺时。

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

Motivation: 复杂天气和光照条件对自动驾驶场景的理解和重建提出了挑战，现有方法难以控制和缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出WeatherDiffusion框架，利用预测的内在图（由文本描述引导）进行高质量逆向渲染，并引入Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA)。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，并在下游任务（如目标检测和图像分割）中表现出显著价值。

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion在自动驾驶场景中实现了高质量的渲染和编辑，提升了在复杂天气条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角约束和法线对齐，有效解决了多视角几何偏差问题，提升了重建精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

Result: 模型在多个基准测试中表现出强鲁棒性和优越性。

Conclusion: 动态建模和TADoc框架有效提升了文档图像去扭曲的效果，DLS指标弥补了现有评估的不足。

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OctreeNCA，一种基于八叉树数据结构的轻量级神经细胞自动机，用于高效分割高分辨率医学图像和视频，显著降低VRAM消耗并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像和视频分割需要全局上下文信息，但传统模型（如UNet或Vision Transformers）因VRAM消耗大而无法一次性处理大输入，导致全局一致性和推理速度受限。

Method: 通过八叉树数据结构扩展神经细胞自动机（NCA）的邻域定义，实现全局知识的高效传递，并开发CUDA实现的NCA推理函数以优化VRAM和速度。

Result: OctreeNCA在评估时比UNet节省90%的VRAM，并能一次性分割184兆像素的病理切片或1分钟的手术视频。

Conclusion: OctreeNCA是一种高效且轻量级的解决方案，适用于高分辨率医学图像和视频的实时分割任务。

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

Motivation: 现有自监督图像分割模型的多阶段预训练过程耗时且难以扩展，导致优化不连续。

Method: 提出快速伪掩码算法UniAP和自监督模型S2-UniSeg，结合QuerySD任务进行连续预训练。

Result: S2-UniSeg在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，如COCO上AP提升6.9。

Conclusion: UniAP和S2-UniSeg有效解决了预训练效率问题，并在性能上取得显著提升。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

Result: 实验证明HiMat能生成结构一致且高频细节丰富的4K SVBRDF贴图，并可推广到内在分解等任务。

Conclusion: HiMat为高效生成高质量SVBRDF提供了一种轻量级解决方案，同时保持了模型的先验能力。

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

Conclusion: TerraMAE为高光谱图像分析提供了一种高效的自监督表示学习方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies

Conclusion: FOCUS-Med展示了AI辅助结肠镜检查的临床潜力，为息肉分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

Motivation: 现有3D表示（如点云、网格和3D高斯）在渲染质量、表面定义和压缩性方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的3D表示方法。

Method: TeSO将3D场景表示为八叉树组织的立方体边界surfel，每个surfel关联一个纹理贴图，并通过压缩方案高效编码几何和纹理。

Result: TeSO在较低比特率下实现了比点云和3D高斯基线更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TeSO是一种高效且高质量的3D表示方法，适用于3D流媒体和AR/VR应用。

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

Motivation: 现有基于提升的3D姿态估计方法在新数据集和实际场景中泛化能力差，需改进。

Method: AugLift在标准2D关键点坐标基础上，稀疏地加入置信度分数和深度估计，利用预训练模型计算。

Result: 实验表明，AugLift在未见数据集上平均提升10.1%，在分布内数据上提升4.0%。

Conclusion: AugLift通过稀疏增强输入信号，显著提升姿态估计模型的泛化能力，且易于集成到现有架构中。

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

Result: 扩散模型生成图像更真实，但GAN在特定条件下（如无ECS）更准确。

Conclusion: GAN和扩散模型各有优势，需进一步优化以可靠增强AI诊断系统的训练数据。

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: CMAMRNet为壁画修复提供了一种高效且艺术真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

Conclusion: DPAL通过动态模式对齐学习，成功实现了轻量级HVM的高效训练和强大泛化能力，适用于多种人本视觉任务。

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模行人意图，显著提高了轨迹预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

Result: 模型成功生成了保留草图外观并模仿参考视频动态的视频，在单次运动定制挑战中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SketchAnimator为草图动画提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，适用于创意表达。

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

Conclusion: 解耦建模和接触一致性约束显著提升了3D人-物交互预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale

multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

Motivation: 现有RVOS方法忽视引用表达式的语义结构，而视频引用表达式还包含事件属性和事件间时间关系，传统方法难以处理。

Method: EventRR分为对象摘要和引用推理两部分：摘要阶段通过瓶颈令牌汇总帧信息；推理阶段构建REG图，通过TCRR逐步累积引用分数。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，EventRR在定量和定性上均优于现有RVOS方法。

Conclusion: EventRR通过结构化事件推理有效解决了视频引用分割的复杂性，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到未见过的植物图像。

Conclusion: DGN方法有效且鲁棒，深度信息显著提升了图像修复质量。

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督方法通过更真实的退化建模，有效解决了真实世界超分辨率的挑战。

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 实验表明CMB-Net优于现有大多数IML模型。

Conclusion: CMB-Net通过结合语义和视觉信息，有效提升了篡改定位的准确性，并保留了边界信息。

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

TL;DR: ASM-UNet是一种基于Mamba的新型架构，用于细粒度分割（FGS），通过自适应扫描分数动态调整扫描顺序，结合群体共性和个体差异，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有粗粒度分割方法在细粒度分割中表现不佳，且传统Mamba模型依赖固定扫描顺序，难以适应个体差异。

Method: 提出ASM-UNet，利用自适应扫描分数动态调整扫描顺序，结合群体共性和个体差异。

Result: 在ACDC、Synapse和BTMS数据集上，ASM-UNet在粗粒度和细粒度分割任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ASM-UNet通过动态扫描顺序解决了细粒度分割的挑战，为临床提供了更精准的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

TL;DR: MiraMo框架通过线性注意力、运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化，提升图像动画的效率、一致性和平滑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像动画中外观一致性和运动平滑性的挑战，同时降低计算资源需求。

Method: 采用线性注意力替代传统自注意力，引入运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化策略。

Result: 实验证明MiraMo在生成一致性、平滑性和可控性动画方面优于现有方法，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: MiraMo为图像动画提供了一种高效、一致且平滑的解决方案，并展示了在运动迁移和视频编辑中的潜力。

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用Transformer和集合论原理改进高光谱视频跟踪的方法，通过建模光谱交互和引入光谱损失，显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模板与搜索区域的空间交互，忽略了光谱交互，导致性能不佳。

Method: 在架构层面，使用Transformer建立带间长程空间关系，并基于集合论的包含-排除原理建模光谱交互；在训练层面，引入光谱损失以增强材料分布对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合空间和光谱信息，显著提升了高光谱视频跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D填补了动态场景理解的空白，提出的框架为细粒度时空推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Result: 实验证明SLC在多种基准和大型VLM中有效，支持开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: SLC是首个训练高效且支持广泛个性化应用的框架，代码将开源。

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

Motivation: 现有方法（如OOD检测和增量学习）在开放世界场景中存在局限性，无法同时实现知识更新和自主性。

Method: 提出OpenHAIV框架，将OOD检测、新类别发现和增量持续微调统一为一个流程。

Result: 框架使模型能在开放世界环境中自主获取和更新知识。

Conclusion: OpenHAIV为开放世界识别提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

Result: 在SSL、WSL和BSL设置下表现优异，尤其在BSL中显著优于现有方法，如5%标注下性能提升29.71%。

Conclusion: SynMatch通过合成图像匹配伪标签，有效提升医学图像分割性能，尤其在标注极少的场景下。

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

Conclusion: BEVANet在实时语义分割中表现优异，兼具高效性和性能。

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

into four categories: fresh, immature, mature, and defective fruits to ensure
robust model training. The proposed model achieves an impressive 93.98%

Conclusion: EviGRPO框架有效提升多页文档理解能力，且数据标注和训练策略支持高质量模型构建。

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述生成方法依赖对象检测器或GCN，存在冗余信息、GCN构建困难和训练成本高的问题。

Method: RORPCap利用图像-文本检索提取对象和关系词，结合提示模板生成提示嵌入，并通过Mamba网络快速映射图像嵌入，最终用GPT-2生成描述。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上，RORPCap仅需2.6小时训练，CIDEr得分120.5%，SPICE得分22.0%，性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: RORPCap是一种高效且性能优越的图像描述生成替代方案。

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner框架有效解决了视频语言对齐的复杂性问题，展示了在长查询任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAR提出了一种新颖的框架，通过冻结预训练参数，仅调整少量参数实现定制化图像生成，解决了现有方法的过拟合和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定制化生成方法依赖全微调或适配器，成本高且易过拟合或灾难性遗忘，CoAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning策略，学习有效且特定的主题表示，并引入正则化防止过拟合和语言漂移。

Result: CoAR在主题和风格个性化任务中表现优异，计算和内存效率显著提升，仅调整0.05%参数。

Conclusion: CoAR是一种高效、轻量级的定制化生成框架，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

TL;DR: SODiff是一种新颖的一步扩散模型，用于JPEG伪影去除，通过语义导向的预训练扩散模型和自适应去噪策略，显著提升了恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JPEG高压缩比会导致严重视觉伪影，现有深度学习方法难以恢复复杂纹理细节，导致输出过度平滑。

Method: 提出SODiff模型，结合语义对齐的图像提示提取器（SAIPE）和质量因子感知时间预测器，优化扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，SODiff在视觉质量和定量指标上优于现有领先方法。

Conclusion: SODiff通过语义导向和自适应策略，有效解决了JPEG伪影问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2DGS在大规模复杂城市场景中表现不佳，导致建筑重建不完整。GS4Buildings旨在通过语义3D建筑模型提供几何指导，改进重建效果。

Method: GS4Buildings直接从低细节语义3D建筑模型初始化高斯，并利用平面几何生成的深度和法线图优化重建过程。还提供建筑区域限制模式以减少高斯基元数量。

Result: 实验显示，GS4Buildings将重建完整性提升20.5%，几何精度提升32.8%，同时减少71.8%的高斯基元。

Conclusion: GS4Buildings展示了语义建筑模型在提升高斯泼溅重建效果方面的潜力，适用于智慧城市和数字孪生等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征裁剪器的跨传感器泛化方法，显著提升了泛化能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上泛化能力差的问题，避免耗时或需额外数据的现有方法。

Method: 通过模块分解揭示关键接口，引入特征裁剪器，采用物理感知无监督损失高效训练，并采用分块并行推理。

Result: 在跨传感器情况下显著提升性能，训练和推理速度极快（如512x512x8图像仅需0.2秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法在质量和效率上均达到最优，适用于实际应用中的跨传感器问题。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: DIP-GS结合Deep Image Prior与3D高斯泼溅，提升稀疏视图重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在多视图下表现优异，但在稀疏视图重建中效果不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出DIP-GS，利用DIP先验和粗到细策略，无需预训练模型。

Result: 在稀疏视图重建任务中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: DIP-GS在稀疏视图场景下优于传统3DGS，且无需外部模型。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

TL;DR: LET-US是一个用于长事件流-文本理解的框架，通过自适应压缩机制减少输入事件量，同时保留关键视觉细节，提升了跨模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs无法有效解释事件流或仅能处理短序列，因此需要一种新方法来处理长事件流与文本的跨模态理解。

Method: 采用两阶段优化范式，结合文本引导的跨模态查询、层次聚类和相似性计算，以及大规模事件-文本对齐数据集训练。

Result: 实验表明，LET-US在长事件流的描述准确性和语义理解上优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: LET-US为长事件流与文本的跨模态理解设立了新标准，并提供了公开的数据集、代码和模型。

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

TL;DR: ForensicsSAM提出了一种对抗性鲁棒的图像伪造检测与定位框架，通过注入伪造和对抗专家，显著提升了模型在对抗攻击下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调（PEFT）方法在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1) 注入伪造专家增强图像编码器；2) 设计轻量级对抗检测器；3) 注入对抗专家修正特征偏移。

Result: ForensicsSAM在多个基准测试中表现出卓越的对抗鲁棒性，并在伪造检测与定位任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM为对抗性攻击下的图像伪造检测与定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

Conclusion: CharacterShot是一种高效且高质量的4D角色动画生成框架，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current

Conclusion: CLUE为伪造检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly

Method: 采用反事实数据增强（CDA）和基于刻板印象程度的新方法（DAUDoS）进行去偏。

Result: CDA减少性别差距6%，DAUDoS减少3%且仅需三分之一数据；两种方法均提升性别识别准确率3%。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器（CLIP）和文本编码器（PaliGemma2）的偏见来源不同，未来可针对性优化。

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

Motivation: 传统方法假设训练数据无异常，但实际数据可能被污染，导致模型将异常误认为正常，影响检测性能。

Method: 第一阶段利用学习偏差（正常样本统计优势和特征空间差异）划分训练集并过滤纯净数据；第二阶段在纯净数据上训练最终检测器。

Result: 在Real-IAD基准测试中表现出优异的异常检测和定位性能，且对噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 框架具有模型无关性，适用于实际场景中不完美的训练数据。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅关注英语文档检索或单页图像的多语言问答，缺乏对长文档多模态检索的评估。

Method: 引入VisR-Bench，包含高质量QA对和多语言文档，评估文本、多模态编码器和MLLM等检索模型。

Result: MLLM显著优于其他模型，但在结构化表格和低资源语言上表现不佳。

Conclusion: VisR-Bench填补了多语言视觉检索的空白，揭示了模型在复杂场景中的挑战。

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Motivation: 传统的手动视觉评估方法耗时、费力且主观，自动化物种和损害识别能显著提高效率和一致性。

Method: 结合通用自监督视觉模型和植物分类学的层次推理，使用多国多年数据集训练，并在不同设备和年份的数据上进行测试。

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

Result: 提出了一种支持全局到局部编辑的鲁棒方法，适用于多种MM-DiT变体。

Conclusion: 研究填补了U-Net方法与新兴架构之间的空白，提供了对MM-DiT行为模式的深入理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法能有效检测和减少异常实例，提升诊断的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: 结合拒绝模块的top-rank学习方法显著提升了医学图像诊断的性能。

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注英文文本，对复杂脚本（如中文）的超分辨率研究较少，需要一种能够恢复精确笔画的方法。

Method: 结合结构先验和StyleGAN模型，使用代码本机制限制生成空间，生成高分辨率结构先验以指导恢复。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效恢复低分辨率中文字符的清晰笔画，适用于不规则布局的真实场景。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为中文文本图像超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

Motivation: 医学图像共享需遵守隐私法规（如HIPAA和DICOM PS3.15），确保患者隐私的同时保持数据的可用性。

Method: 应用了像素掩码、日期偏移、哈希、文本识别、替换和移除等方法。

Result: 算法在挑战中正确执行99.92%的任务，排名第二。

Conclusion: 分析了当前方法的局限性并提出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Method: 通过聚类非肿瘤区域的WSI特征作为域，采用两阶段对比学习（WSI级和patch级）减少域间差异。

Result: 有效减少了病理图像中的域偏移问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为病理图像域泛化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

Result: 实验表明，CoT-Pose模型能从抽象文本输入生成语义对齐且合理的3D姿态。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了高层次理解在姿态生成中的重要性，为推理增强的姿态生成方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

Result: MatchVoice展现出良好的泛化能力，但仍需结合更广泛的视频-语言领域技术以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了MatchVoice在足球集锦解说中的潜力，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pseudo-labeling method for medical image

effective pseudo-labels. We introduce Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU
learning), which uses only positive and unlabeled data for binary

foreground and background regions on each unlabeled image. Our PU learning
makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The

Motivation: 端到端模型的中间功能模块缺乏显式监督信号，导致机制不透明且可解释性有限。

Method: 构建了双粒度动态加权评分系统（DG-DWSS）和基于CLIP的特征图质量评估网络（CLIP-FMQE-Net），实现特征图的实时质量分析。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，集成评估模块后3D目标检测性能提升，NDS增益3.89%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特征表示质量和整体模型性能。

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

TL;DR: ACE框架通过动态缓存和自适应决策边界提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移下性能下降，现有缓存方法因不可靠置信度和刚性决策边界而受限。

Method: 提出ACE框架，通过动态阈值和探索增强更新构建鲁棒缓存，实现自适应决策边界。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上，ACE表现优于现有TTA方法，具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ACE通过自适应缓存和决策边界，显著提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Vision Transformers（ViTs）中LayerNorm在数据稀缺和领域转移下的微调动态，提出了Fine-tuning Shift Ratio（FSR）和一种简单的重缩放机制，以优化LayerNorm的微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LayerNorm在ViTs中至关重要，但其在数据稀缺和领域转移下的微调动态尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索LayerNorm参数的变化如何反映源域和目标域之间的转移，并提出优化方法。

Method: 提出了Fine-tuning Shift Ratio（FSR）量化目标训练样本的代表性，并设计了一个基于标量λ的重缩放机制，结合循环框架优化LayerNorm微调。

Result: 实验表明，OOD任务通常具有较低的FSR和较高的λ，表明目标训练样本代表性不足；病理数据上的微调更接近ID设置，支持保守的LayerNorm更新。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LayerNorm在迁移学习中的动态特性，并提供了实用的微调策略，尤其在数据稀缺和领域转移场景下表现优异。

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

TL;DR: GAPNet是一种基于粒度感知范式的轻量级网络，用于图像和视频显著目标检测（SOD），通过多尺度解码器输出和高效特征融合模块实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOD模型依赖重型主干网络，计算成本高，限制了在边缘设备上的实际应用。

Method: 采用粒度感知连接、粒度金字塔卷积（GPC）和跨尺度注意力（CSA）模块，结合自注意力模块优化特征利用和语义解释。

Result: 在轻量级图像和视频SOD模型中达到新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: GAPNet通过高效设计和监督策略，显著提升了轻量级SOD模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声音病理诊断方法侵入性强且主观，需要非侵入、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 使用MFCCs、chroma特征和Mel频谱图分析声学数据，结合RNN（LSTM和注意力机制）分类，并通过数据增强提高泛化能力。

Result: 框架能有效分类正常与病理声音，为非侵入性诊断提供工具。

Conclusion: 该框架为声音病理早期检测提供自动化支持，有望改善医疗效果。

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

TL;DR: DF-P2E是一个多模态框架，通过视觉、语义和叙述层解释，使深度伪造检测更具可解释性和可访问性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字完整性构成严重威胁，现有检测系统缺乏透明度和可解释性，限制了其在实际决策中的实用性。

Method: DF-P2E包含三个模块：基于Grad-CAM的深度伪造分类器、视觉描述模块和叙述优化模块，结合LLM生成用户敏感的解释。

Result: 在DF40基准测试中，系统实现了竞争性的检测性能，并提供与Grad-CAM激活一致的高质量解释。

Conclusion: DF-P2E通过统一预测和解释，为可解释的深度伪造检测提供了可扩展的方法，推动了透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Method: 结合双镜头生成与循环视频技术，生成长对话视频并保持角色一致性。

Result: 在镜头切换布局、空间连续性和对话长度灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShoulderShot为实用对话视频生成提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and
advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional
connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely
underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

Result: LaVieID能够生成高保真个性化视频，并实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LaVieID通过空间和时间优化，显著提升了身份保持视频生成的效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

Result: 模型编辑性能优异，数据集优于现有开源数据集。

Conclusion: X2Edit为图像编辑提供了高质量数据集和高效训练方法，开源资源促进社区发展。

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The
open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段方法，通过隐式神经表示（INR）生成先验图像并校正投影数据，以减少牙科CBCT中的截断伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型探测器导致视野截断，传统迭代重建方法会因截断误差累积而降低图像质量。

Method: 第一阶段使用INR生成扩展区域的先验图像，第二阶段用校正后的投影数据进行迭代重建。

Result: 数值结果表明该方法有效抑制了截断伪影，提高了图像质量。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法显著改善了牙科CBCT的图像质量。

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

Motivation: 房颤消融手术效果差异大，需改进消融效果评估和优化方法。

Method: 提出SOFA框架，模拟消融后瘢痕形成并预测复发风险，优化消融参数。

Result: SOFA准确合成消融后图像，优化方案使模型预测复发风险降低22.18%。

Conclusion: SOFA首次整合模拟、预测和优化，为个性化房颤消融提供新工具。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的后期处理框架，利用物体间的空间关系修正检测异常，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在静态环境中，物体的空间布局通常一致，但现有检测模型未能充分利用这一先验，导致检测不一致或错误。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）建模物体间的空间关系，修正异常检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了检测性能，mAP@50最高提升4%。

Conclusion: 通过利用环境的空间结构，可以显著提升物体检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

Conclusion: TER通过引入置信模块和新的评估标准，显著提升了情感识别模型的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示或布局控制遮挡，但缺乏精确性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型和体积渲染原理，在潜在空间中根据遮挡关系和透射率渲染场景。

Result: 在遮挡精度上显著优于现有方法，并能调整物体透明度、密度等效果。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，实现了物理基础的精确遮挡控制，扩展了图像生成的应用范围。

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

Motivation: 由于SAR数据标注需要专业知识，噪声标签不可避免，导致ATR性能下降。现有研究主要针对图像数据，SAR的非直观视觉特性使其难以实现噪声鲁棒学习。

Method: 设计了多模型特征融合框架，将散射特征与深度特征结合；利用动态图结构数据建模散射中心，通过高斯混合模型（GMM）划分干净和噪声标签样本，并进行半监督学习。

Result: 在MSTAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同噪声条件下均能取得最优性能。

Conclusion: CLSDF方法通过融合物理特征和深度学习，有效提升了SAR ATR在噪声标签下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

Conclusion: TAR-TVG通过时间戳锚点和自蒸馏策略，显著提升了视频片段定位的准确性和推理过程的可解释性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户希望在不破坏3D内容几何的情况下进行颜色、风格和光照的编辑，但现有2D编辑工具直接应用于3D生成会导致信息丢失。

Method: 通过几何保持模块和注入切换器，利用原始法线潜在信息指导多视图生成，确保编辑颜色与法线视图的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多视图一致性和网格质量上均有提升，适用于多种多视图扩散模型和编辑方法的组合。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D内容编辑中的几何对齐问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

Conclusion: 提出的模型在星形分割任务中表现出色，能够适应多种复杂场景。

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于三重连接的样本重加权方法TriReWeight，用于解决生成数据增强中噪声图像的问题，并在理论和实验上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉模型在医疗诊断等应用中因图像稀缺而性能受限，生成数据增强是解决方案，但生成过程不可控可能导致噪声图像。

Method: 提出TriReWeight方法，通过三重连接的样本重加权优化生成数据增强，理论上兼容所有生成方法且性能不降。

Result: 实验表明，TriReWeight在六个自然图像数据集上平均优于现有方法7.9%，在三个医疗数据集上平均优于3.4%。

Conclusion: TriReWeight能有效提升生成数据增强的性能，具有理论和实验的双重验证。

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的加速方法GSD，通过动态分组策略显著提升自回归图像模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像模型推理速度慢，传统Speculative Decoding方法未能充分利用图像令牌的冗余性和多样性。

Method: 提出Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD)，动态评估视觉有效令牌簇而非单一目标令牌。

Result: GSD平均加速3.7倍，且保持图像质量。

Conclusion: GSD为自回归图像模型提供了一种高效、无需训练的加速方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Contrastive Inversion的新方法，通过对比输入图像提取共同概念，无需额外信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定制化图像生成需求增加，现有方法依赖额外指导（如文本提示或空间掩码），可能导致辅助特征分离不完整，影响生成质量。

Method: 通过对比学习训练目标标记和图像辅助文本标记，提取解耦的真实语义；应用解耦交叉注意力微调以提高概念保真度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在概念表示和编辑方面表现均衡且高效，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Contrastive Inversion无需额外信息即可有效提取共同概念，生成质量高。

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

Motivation: 现有参考分割方法依赖元学习，数据与计算成本高，需轻量级解决方案。

Method: 将参考-目标图像对的对应关系表示为伪视频，利用SAM2的iVOS能力，结合DBST和TTGA模块。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，分割性能提升超5%。

Conclusion: CAV-SAM为轻量级适应下游任务提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

Method: 构建UniSVG数据集（525k数据项），用于MLLM训练与评估，支持文本提示和图像到SVG的转换。

Result: UniSVG显著提升开源MLLM在SVG U&G任务上的性能，超越GPT-4V等闭源模型。

Conclusion: UniSVG为SVG U&G任务提供了首个综合性数据集，推动了多模态模型在该领域的发展。

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

Conclusion: 协同设计框架对于将基础模型适应于密集感知任务至关重要。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

Motivation: 当前方法在保持视角一致性和处理复杂场景动态时存在困难，尤其是在大规模多元素交互环境中。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：先通过少样本学习从单张图像预测最佳相机轨迹，再通过姿态条件扩散过程生成几何一致的多视角序列，最终转换为持久4D表示。

Result: 在mPSNR和mSSIM等指标上优于现有方法，显著提升了4D生成质量。

Conclusion: Dream4D首次结合了视频扩散模型的时间先验和重建模型的几何感知能力，为4D内容合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

Motivation: 现有的零样本学习方法依赖于手动定义的语义原型，这些原型可能因实例级不匹配和类级不精确性而引入噪声监督，影响知识迁移效果。

Result: 在AWA2、SUN和CUB基准数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLZSL通过动态调整原型和课程学习策略，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该方法为旋转动力学建模提供了一种通用且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于未知物理参数的场景。

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality

Conclusion: 片段化方法为步态识别提供了新的视角，展示了多尺度时间上下文的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

TL;DR: PrIINeR是一种基于INR的MRI重建方法，通过整合预训练深度学习模型的知识，解决了高加速因子下图像质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速MRI扫描会降低图像质量，现有INR方法在高加速因子下表现不佳，导致结构丢失和伪影。

Method: PrIINeR结合了预训练模型的先验知识和实例优化，同时强制执行双重数据一致性。

Result: 在NYU fastMRI数据集上，PrIINeR优于现有INR和部分学习型方法，显著提升结构保留和保真度，有效消除伪影。

Conclusion: PrIINeR结合深度学习和INR技术，为高质量加速MRI重建提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,
accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TSDF的两阶段防御框架，旨在通过双功能对抗扰动持久防御深度伪造技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动防御策略缺乏持久性，攻击者可通过重新训练模型绕过防御，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了强度分离机制，利用双功能对抗扰动直接扭曲伪造结果并破坏攻击者的数据准备过程。

Result: 实验表明，TSDF具有强大的双重防御能力，显著提升了防御的持久性。

Conclusion: TSDF通过阻断攻击者模型的适应能力，实现了长期有效的防御。

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练模型的类增量学习方法通常冻结预训练网络并使用轻量级模块（如适配器）适应增量任务，但模块选择错误和任务特定模块忽视共享知识导致性能下降。

Method: 论文提出训练任务特定适配器捕获关键特征，并引入基于熵的选择机制；同时通过适配器融合策略构建通用适配器，结合两者预测以利用专业和通用知识。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TUNA方法通过结合任务特定和通用适配器，有效提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Conclusion: MambaTrans通过结合文本、掩码和图像的长期依赖关系，显著改善了多模态融合图像在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

Result: 在多个姿态生成基准测试中，Pose-RFT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合动作强化微调在3D姿态生成任务中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

Motivation: 传统回归方法生成不真实细节且需大量配对数据，而生成扩散模型难以保证时间一致性。DiTVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DiTVR采用扩散变换器与轨迹感知注意力机制，结合光流轨迹对齐令牌，并通过小波引导的流一致性采样器注入数据一致性。

Result: DiTVR在视频修复基准测试中达到零样本最优性能，表现出卓越的时间一致性和细节保留能力。

Conclusion: DiTVR通过创新注意力机制和采样器设计，有效解决了视频修复中的时间一致性和细节保留问题。

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAR-光学图像匹配方法依赖像素级标注，耗时且难以获取足够标注数据，因此需要一种更高效的半监督方法。

Method: 设计半监督匹配流程，利用伪标签生成相似性热图，并结合跨模态特征增强模块，通过无监督目标分离模态共享和特定特征。

Result: S2M2-SAR在基准数据集上表现优于现有半监督方法，并与全监督SOTA方法竞争。

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR高效且实用，为SAR-光学图像匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

Motivation: 现有无参考图像质量评估方法在全局表示或区域特征均匀加权方面存在不足，无法充分捕捉语义显著区域或局部质量变化。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model动态分割图像为语义区域，结合多模态大语言模型提取内容和感知失真，并通过区域感知语义注意力机制整合局部信息。

Result: 实验证明RSFIQA在多个基准数据集上表现出色，具有鲁棒性和竞争力。

Conclusion: RSFIQA通过细粒度区域分析和注意力机制，显著提升了无参考图像质量评估的性能。

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,

We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，CBDES MoE在3D目标检测中表现优于单专家模型，mAP提高1.6点，NDS提升4.1点。

Conclusion: CBDES MoE是一种有效的模块化混合专家框架，显著提升了BEV感知系统的性能。

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: Deep SWM为太阳耀斑预测提供了高效可靠的解决方案，并开源了新的基准数据集。

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

Motivation: 研究Ge表面微结构的形态特性如何受离子束辐照参数（角度和通量）的影响。

Method: 处理电子显微镜图像提取拓扑特征为骨架图，用图卷积网络嵌入，PCA分析嵌入结果，并用Davies-Bouldin指数评估聚类可分性。

Result: 辐照角度的变化对Ge表面形态特性的影响比辐照通量的变化更显著。

Conclusion: 辐照角度是影响Ge表面微结构形态特性的主要因素。

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge
surfaces by ion beam irradiation were processed to extract topological features
as skeleton graphs, which were then embedded using a graph convolutional
network. The resulting embeddings were analyzed using principal component
analysis, and cluster separability in the resulting PCA space was evaluated
using the Davies-Bouldin index. The results indicate that variations in
irradiation angle have a more significant impact on the morphological
properties of Ge surfaces than variations in irradiation fluence.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive
structures, and enable context-aware robotic assistance during complex
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue
tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for
accurate, markerless 3D tracking in challenging surgical scenarios.

Motivation: 现有图像令牌剪枝方法主要针对单图像任务，忽视了多模态ICL中更大的冗余和效率需求，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出CATP方法，通过两阶段渐进剪枝处理多模态ICL中的跨模态交互，无需训练。

Result: 剪除77.8%的图像令牌后，CATP在四个LVLM和八个基准测试中平均性能提升0.6%，推理延迟平均降低10.78%。

Conclusion: CATP提升了多模态ICL的实用价值，为未来图像-文本交错场景的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效将激活从无关区域转移到有意义的功能线索上。

Conclusion: 该方法在多视角学习中显著提升了功能部分定位的准确性。

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

Result: 仅增加约1%参数，视频质量和身份保留效果优于全参数训练方法，并可无缝集成其他任务。

Conclusion: Stand-In框架高效且多功能，为身份保留视频生成提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

Motivation: 动态场景的单目视频重建面临内存需求困境：静态结构需要长期稳定性，而动态运动需要快速高保真细节保留。现有方法难以兼顾两者。

Method: Mem4D采用双内存架构：瞬态动态内存（TDM）捕捉高频运动细节，持久结构内存（PSM）保留长期空间信息。通过交替查询实现静态几何和动态元素的高保真重建。

Result: 实验表明，Mem4D在保持高效的同时，实现了静态几何的全局一致性和动态元素的高保真重建，性能达到或优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mem4D通过解耦静态和动态建模，有效解决了内存需求困境，为动态场景重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Result: 在Charades-STA和ActivityNet Captions基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TAG方法简单有效，解决了现有问题且不依赖LLMs，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long

Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline

TL;DR: Omni-Effects是一个统一框架，能够生成提示引导的效果和空间可控的复合效果，解决了多VFX联合训练中的干扰和空间不可控问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在VFX生产中受限于单效果生成，无法满足需要空间可控复合效果的应用需求。

Method: 提出LoRA-MoE和SAP两项创新，结合IIF模块，实现多样效果集成和精确空间控制。

Result: 实验表明，Omni-Effects能够实现精确空间控制和多样效果生成。

Conclusion: Omni-Effects为VFX生产提供了高效、可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

*Xiantao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文指出多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在盲人和视障人士（BVI）辅助技术中存在‘电梯问题’——无法感知电梯运行方向，揭示了‘隐式运动盲区’的深层限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs作为辅助技术潜力巨大，但在实际应用中存在信任问题，尤其是对连续低信号运动的感知不足。

Method: 通过分析现有视频理解中的帧采样范式，指出其将视频视为静态图像序列的局限性。

Result: 提出‘隐式运动盲区’概念，并探讨其对用户信任的影响。

Conclusion: 呼吁从语义识别转向物理感知，开发以人为中心的新基准，优先考虑动态环境中的安全和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGraD提出了一种基于Vision Foundation Models的群体活动检测方法，通过可学习的群体提示和轻量级Transformer提升性能，尤其在多群体场景中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision Foundation Models（如DinoV2）虽在对象中心数据上表现优异，但未充分探索群体动态建模，直接替换CNN骨干网络效果有限，需结构化群体感知推理。

Method: ProGraD结合1）可学习的群体提示引导VFM注意力，2）轻量级两层GroupContext Transformer推断参与者-群体关联和集体行为。

Result: 在Cafe和Social-CAD基准测试中超越现有方法，多群体场景下提升6.5%（Group mAP@1.0）和8.2%（Group mAP@0.5），仅需10M可训练参数。

Conclusion: ProGraD不仅性能优越，还生成可解释的注意力图，为群体推理提供洞察，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: SRA是一种无需搜索的自动数据增强方法，通过动态调整增强策略和启发式评分模块，显著提升了性能，并在ImageNet上达到了78.31%的Top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主流AutoDA方法搜索耗时过长或性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA)，结合启发式评分模块和非对称增强策略。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率，并展示了良好的兼容性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SRA为更简单、高效且实用的AutoDA设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 手术室中标准化服装掩盖了识别标志，导致模型依赖无关视觉线索（如鞋子、眼镜等），影响任务准确性。需要避免这种偏差以开发更智能的手术辅助系统。

Method: 通过梯度显著性分析揭示CNN模型的偏差，并提出使用3D点云序列编码人员信息，分离形状和运动模式与外观干扰。

Result: 实验显示，在真实临床环境中，RGB模型准确性下降12%，而几何方法表现更稳定，表明其能捕捉更有意义的生物特征。

Conclusion: 几何表示能更有效地建模手术室中的人员特征，为开发鲁棒的人类建模方法提供了方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

Conclusion: TRIDE通过多模态融合和天气适应机制显著提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在生成高质量单目视频方面表现优异，但生成3D立体和空间视频仍是一个未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 利用深度信息将单目视频变形到预定义视角，采用帧矩阵修复框架合成缺失内容，并通过双更新方案提升修复质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种生成模型（如Sora、Lumiere等）上显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成沉浸式3D视频提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息瓶颈的因果注意力方法（IBCA），用于医学图像的多标签分类，通过高斯混合多标签空间注意力过滤无关信息，并通过对比增强因果干预减少虚假注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医学图像多标签分类中难以区分因果和无关特征，导致诊断准确性受限。

Method: 提出结构因果模型（SCM）和IBCA方法，结合高斯混合多标签空间注意力和对比增强因果干预。

Result: 在Endo和MuReD数据集上，IBCA在多个指标上显著优于其他方法，如CR、OR和mAP。

Conclusion: IBCA能有效学习类特异性注意力，提升医学图像多标签分类的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在性能上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ME-TST和ME-TST+通过时序动态建模和任务协同，显著提升了微表情分析的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

Conclusion: Matrix-3D通过全景表示和高效重建方法，实现了高质量、广覆盖的3D世界生成。

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

Motivation: 植物根系结构复杂且缺乏纹理信息，传统2D研究难以满足需求，3D信息对研究遗传性状至关重要。

Result: 提取的3D骨架与真实结构高度相似，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可提升育种效率，减少人工干预，推动现代农业智能化。

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态理解与生成提供了一种高效且深入的统一框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged

instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练和掩码的框架Follow-Your-Shape，通过轨迹差异图（TDM）和KV注入机制，实现精确可控的形状编辑，同时保持非目标内容不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式图像编辑模型在大规模形状变换任务中表现不佳，容易改变非目标区域或无法实现预期形状变化。

Method: 通过计算反转和去噪路径的轨迹差异图（TDM），定位可编辑区域，并结合KV注入机制实现稳定编辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在形状编辑任务中表现出更高的可编辑性和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Shape框架有效解决了大规模形状编辑中的挑战，并提出了新的评估基准ReShapeBench。

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

Method: 提出Multi-View Frequency Consistency增强视角一致性，并设计Controllable Stylized Distillation通过负引导抑制内容泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景和风格下均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: FantasyStyle通过扩散模型蒸馏和优化策略，显著提升了3D风格迁移的效果。

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

Result: 实验表明，ReconDreamer-RL在端到端自动驾驶训练中优于模仿学习方法，碰撞率降低5倍。

Conclusion: ReconDreamer-RL通过创新方法有效缩小仿真与现实的差距，提升自动驾驶训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Result: 在流体和大气模拟数据集上验证了CD-TVD的准确性和高效性。

Conclusion: CD-TVD显著提升了大规模科学模拟的数据增强能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前医学影像中的区域定位方法依赖于显式空间提示，无法处理临床实践中的隐式查询，因此需要一种结合推理和定位的新方法。

Method: 提出了MedReasoner框架，将推理与分割分离：通过强化学习优化MLLM推理模块，同时使用冻结的分割专家生成掩码，并通过格式和准确性奖励实现对齐。

Conclusion: 强化学习在可解释的医学定位中具有显著潜力，MedReasoner框架为医学影像的推理和定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Motivation: RGBD相机虽提供深度数据但未充分利用，现有数据集小且多样性不足，需解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 利用MoCap数据集生成单视角模拟深度数据，训练掩码自编码器完成部分网格，推理时匹配深度数据生成完整网格。

Result: 在SURREAL、CAPE和BEHAVE数据集上分别达到16.8 mm、22.0 mm和70.9 PVE，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M$^3$方法有效利用深度数据，显著提升3D人体网格估计精度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Result: PP-Motion在物理对齐和人类感知方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PP-Motion为运动生成提供了更全面的评估标准，同时考虑了物理可行性和人类感知。

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在超光谱图像融合中存在令牌冗余和多尺度特征建模不足的问题，且难以保留高频成分和局部细节。

Method: 提出THAT框架，包括Pivotal Token Selective Attention（PTSA）和Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network（MVFN），以优化令牌选择和高频细节学习。

Result: 实验表明，THAT在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提升了重建质量和效率。

Conclusion: THAT通过改进高频特征表示和令牌选择，显著提升了超光谱图像融合的效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future

Motivation: 现有方法依赖多模态数据学习空间关系，但手术室通常缺乏多传感器支持，且仅用2D数据难以捕捉复杂场景的细节。

Method: 引入Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block，将2D输入与3D空间知识结合，通过端到端MLLM框架实现3D场景推理。

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM为手术室空间建模提供了高效且无需额外标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SAGOnline为实时3D场景理解和AR/VR应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

### [216] [OMGSR: You Only Need One Mid-timestep Guidance for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08227)
*Zhiqiang Wu,Zhaomang Sun,Tong Zhou,Bingtao Fu,Ji Cong,Yitong Dong,Huaqi Zhang,Xuan Tang,Mingsong Chen,Xian Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMGSR提出了一种基于DDPM/FM的一步式Real-ISR框架，通过在中时间步注入LQ图像潜在分布，并引入潜在分布细化损失和重叠分块LPIPS/GAN损失，显著提升了图像超分辨率的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Real-ISR方法在初始时间步注入LQ图像潜在分布时存在与高斯噪声潜在分布的根本差距，限制了生成先验的有效利用。

Method: OMGSR在中时间步注入LQ图像潜在分布，结合潜在分布细化损失和重叠分块LPIPS/GAN损失，设计了两种变体OMGSR-S和OMGSR-F。

Result: OMGSR-S/F在512分辨率下表现优异，OMGSR-F在所有参考指标中占据主导地位，1k分辨率版本在细节生成上表现突出。

Conclusion: OMGSR通过优化潜在分布对齐和消除伪影，显著提升了一步式Real-ISR的性能，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Next Shot Generation (NSG)的方法，通过Cut2Next框架生成符合专业编辑模式和严格电影连续性的高质量镜头，解决了现有方法在叙事流畅性和电影完整性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多注重基本视觉一致性，忽视了推动叙事流畅的关键编辑模式（如正反打镜头、插入镜头等），导致输出缺乏叙事复杂性和电影完整性。

Method: 提出Cut2Next框架，采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)和Hierarchical Multi-Prompting策略，结合Relational Prompts和Individual Prompts，并通过Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI)和Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM)整合信号。

Result: 实验表明Cut2Next在视觉一致性和文本保真度上表现优异，用户研究显示其更符合编辑模式和电影连续性。

Conclusion: Cut2Next能够生成高质量、叙事表达丰富且电影连贯的后续镜头，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

TL;DR: StableAvatar是一种端到端的视频扩散变换器，能够生成无限长度的高质量视频，解决了现有模型在音频同步和身份一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动的虚拟化身视频生成模型难以生成长视频且音频同步和身份一致性差，主要原因是音频建模不足。

Method: 提出Time-step-aware Audio Adapter防止误差累积，Audio Native Guidance Mechanism增强音频同步，Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy提升视频平滑度。

Result: 实验证明StableAvatar在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableAvatar通过创新的音频适配器和动态策略，实现了高质量无限长度视频生成。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: R3DGS任务和ReferSplat框架为3D多模态理解提供了新方向，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成物理合理的动画，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从单张图像生成物理一致的4D场景，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

Abstract: The increasing demand for critical raw materials has revitalized interest in
abandoned underground mines, which pose extreme challenges for conventional
drilling machinery due to confined, unstructured, and infrastructure-less
environments. This paper presents the Stinger Robot, a novel compact robotic
platform specifically designed for autonomous high-force drilling in such
settings. The robot features a mechanically self-locking tri-leg bracing
mechanism that enables stable anchoring to irregular tunnel surfaces. A key
innovation lies in its force-aware, closed-loop control strategy, which enables
force interaction with unstructured environments during bracing and drilling.
Implemented as a finite-state machine in ROS 2, the control policy dynamically
adapts leg deployment based on real-time contact feedback and load thresholds,
ensuring stability without external supports. We demonstrate, through
simulation and preliminary hardware tests, that the Stinger Robot can
autonomously stabilize and drill in conditions previously inaccessible to
nowadays mining machines. This work constitutes the first validated robotic
architecture to integrate distributed force-bracing and autonomous drilling in
underground environments, laying the groundwork for future collaborative mining

novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and
interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical
vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical

with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates
end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial
generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level
execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum
of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines,
end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle
modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments,
with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla.
A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible
environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables
real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from
drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial
conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for
adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.

Abstract: Inspection of aquaculture net pens is essential for ensuring the structural

Traditional methods, typically based on manually operated or single-ROV
systems, offer limited adaptability to real-time constraints such as energy
consumption, hardware faults, and dynamic underwater conditions. This paper
introduces AquaChat++, a novel multi-ROV inspection framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive mission planning, coordinated task
execution, and fault-tolerant control in complex aquaculture environments. The
proposed system consists of a two-layered architecture. The high-level plan
generation layer employs an LLM, such as ChatGPT-4, to translate natural
language user commands into symbolic, multi-agent inspection plans. A task
manager dynamically allocates and schedules actions among ROVs based on their
real-time status and operational constraints, including thruster faults and
battery levels. The low-level control layer ensures accurate trajectory
tracking and integrates thruster fault detection and compensation mechanisms.
By incorporating real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning, AquaChat++
enhances system robustness and operational efficiency. Simulated experiments in
a physics-based aquaculture environment demonstrate improved inspection
coverage, energy-efficient behavior, and resilience to actuator failures. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven frameworks to support scalable,

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper presents a new adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) framework for
quadrotors that achieves robust and agile flight under tight computational
constraints. The proposed controller addresses key limitations of prior SMC
formulations, including (i) the slow convergence and almost-global stability of
$\mathrm{SO(3)}$-based methods, (ii) the oversimplification of rotational
dynamics in Euler-based controllers, (iii) the unwinding phenomenon in
quaternion-based formulations, and (iv) the gain overgrowth problem in adaptive
SMC schemes. Leveraging nonsmooth stability analysis, we provide rigorous
global stability proofs for both the nonsmooth attitude sliding dynamics
defined on $\mathbb{S}^3$ and the position sliding dynamics. Our controller is
computationally efficient and runs reliably on a resource-constrained nano
quadrotor, achieving 250 Hz and 500 Hz refresh rates for position and attitude
control, respectively. In an extensive set of hardware experiments with over
130 flight trials, the proposed controller consistently outperforms three
benchmark methods, demonstrating superior trajectory tracking accuracy and
robustness with relatively low control effort. The controller enables
aggressive maneuvers such as dynamic throw launches, flip maneuvers, and
accelerations exceeding 3g, which is remarkable for a 32-gram nano quadrotor.
These results highlight promising potential for real-world applications,
particularly in scenarios requiring robust, high-performance flight control
under significant external disturbances and tight computational constraints.

Abstract: We propose a novel concept of operations using optimal planning methods and
machine learning (ML) to collect spaceborne data that is unprecedented for
monitoring wildfires, process it to create new or enhanced products in the
context of wildfire danger or spread monitoring, and assimilate them to improve
existing, wildfire decision support tools delivered to firefighters within
latency appropriate for time-critical applications. The concept is studied with
respect to NASA's CYGNSS Mission, a constellation of passive microwave
receivers that measure specular GNSS-R reflections despite clouds and smoke.
Our planner uses a Mixed Integer Program formulation to schedule joint
observation data collection and downlink for all satellites. Optimal solutions
are found quickly that collect 98-100% of available observation opportunities.
ML-based fire predictions that drive the planner objective are greater than 40%
more correlated with ground truth than existing state-of-art. The presented
case study on the TX Smokehouse Creek fire in 2024 and LA fires in 2025
represents the first high-resolution data collected by CYGNSS of active fires.
Creation of Burnt Area Maps (BAM) using ML applied to the data during active
fires and BAM assimilation into NASA's Weather Research and Forecasting Model
using ML to broadcast fire spread are novel outcomes. BAM and CYGNSS obtained
soil moisture are integrated for the first time into USGS fire danger maps.
Inclusion of CYGNSS data in ML-based burn predictions boosts accuracy by 13%,
and inclusion of high-resolution data boosts ML recall by another 15%. The
proposed workflow has an expected latency of 6-30h, improving on the current
delivery time of multiple days. All components in the proposed concept are
shown to be computationally scalable and globally generalizable, with
sustainability considerations such as edge efficiency and low latency on small
devices.

TL;DR: ORCA-FL通过模糊逻辑控制器改进ORCA，以更好地处理路径规划中的不确定性和不精确性，在特定条件下减少碰撞次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞避免算法（如DWA、TEB、RVO和ORCA）存在路径次优、计算成本高或动态适应性不足的问题，ORCA-FL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑控制器（FLCs）改进ORCA，并结合模糊Q强化学习（FQL）优化FLCs。

Result: 实验表明，ORCA-FL在特定速度条件下优于ORCA，减少了碰撞次数。

Conclusion: ORCA-FL通过模糊逻辑和强化学习优化，提高了动态多环境中的避障性能。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance enables autonomous agents and robots to operate safely and
efficiently in dynamic and complex environments, reducing the risk of
collisions and damage. For a robot or autonomous system to successfully
navigate through obstacles, it must be able to detect such obstacles. While
numerous collision avoidance algorithms like the dynamic window approach (DWA),
timed elastic bands (TEB), and reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO) have been
proposed, they may lead to suboptimal paths due to fixed weights, be
computationally expensive, or have limited adaptability to dynamic obstacles in
multi-agent environments. Optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), which
improves on RVO, provides smoother trajectories and stronger collision
avoidance guarantees. We propose ORCA-FL to improve on ORCA by using fuzzy
logic controllers (FLCs) to better handle uncertainty and imprecision for
obstacle avoidance in path planning. Numerous multi-agent experiments are
conducted and it is shown that ORCA-FL can outperform ORCA in reducing the
number of collision if the agent has a velocity that exceeds a certain
threshold. In addition, a proposed algorithm for improving ORCA-FL using fuzzy
Q reinforcement learning (FQL) is detailed for optimizing and tuning FLCs.

Result: 模型能够学习机器人动态，结合采样规划器完成新任务，并在仿真和真实环境中验证了其适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型对输入损坏和环境变化的鲁棒性，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Structural causal models describe how the components of a robotic system
interact. They provide both structural and functional information about the
relationships that are present in the system. The structural information
outlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional
information describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned
models. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while
accounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more
robust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using
significantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common
model-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage
the sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating
a causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that
inform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder
probabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics
of a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform
new tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new
requirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile
robots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the
learned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and
changes in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world
robotics scenarios. Video: https://youtu.be/X6k5t7OOnNc.

Abstract: Safety-critical control using high-dimensional sensory feedback from optical
data (e.g., images, point clouds) poses significant challenges in domains like
autonomous driving and robotic surgery. Control can rely on low-dimensional
states estimated from high-dimensional data. However, the estimation errors
often follow complex, unknown distributions that standard probabilistic models
fail to capture, making formal safety guarantees challenging. In this work, we
introduce a novel characterization of these general estimation errors using
sub-Gaussian noise with bounded mean. We develop a new technique for
uncertainty propagation of proposed noise characterization in linear systems,
which combines robust set-based methods with the propagation of sub-Gaussian
variance proxies. We further develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework
that provides closed-loop safety guarantees for linear systems under the
proposed noise assumption. We apply this MPC approach in an
ultrasound-image-guided robotic spinal surgery pipeline, which contains
deep-learning-based semantic segmentation, image-based registration, high-level
optimization-based planning, and low-level robotic control. To validate the
pipeline, we developed a realistic simulation environment integrating real
human anatomy, robot dynamics, efficient ultrasound simulation, as well as
in-vivo data of breathing motion and drilling force. Evaluation results in
simulation demonstrate the potential of our approach for solving complex
image-guided robotic surgery task while ensuring safety.

Abstract: Bipedal robots demonstrate potential in navigating challenging terrains
through dynamic ground contact. However, current frameworks often depend solely
on proprioception or use manually designed visual pipelines, which are fragile
in real-world settings and complicate real-time footstep planning in
unstructured environments. To address this problem, we present a vision-based
hierarchical control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning
high-level footstep planner, which generates footstep commands based on a local
elevation map, with a low-level Operational Space Controller that tracks the
generated trajectories. We utilize the Angular Momentum Linear Inverted
Pendulum model to construct a low-dimensional state representation to capture
an informative encoding of the dynamics while reducing complexity. We evaluate
our method across different terrain conditions using the underactuated bipedal
robot Cassie and investigate the capabilities and challenges of our approach
through simulation and hardware experiments.

Conclusion: D3P通过动态去噪步骤分配，显著提升实时性能，适用于复杂机器人任务。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at learning complex action distributions for robotic
visuomotor tasks, yet their iterative denoising process poses a major
bottleneck for real-time deployment. Existing acceleration methods apply a
fixed number of denoising steps per action, implicitly treating all actions as
equally important. However, our experiments reveal that robotic tasks often
contain a mix of \emph{crucial} and \emph{routine} actions, which differ in
their impact on task success. Motivated by this finding, we propose
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{D}enoising \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{(D3P)}, a diffusion-based policy that adaptively allocates denoising
steps across actions at test time. D3P uses a lightweight, state-aware adaptor
to allocate the optimal number of denoising steps for each action. We jointly
optimize the adaptor and base diffusion policy via reinforcement learning to
balance task performance and inference efficiency. On simulated tasks, D3P
achieves an averaged 2.2$\times$ inference speed-up over baselines without
degrading success. Furthermore, we demonstrate D3P's effectiveness on a
physical robot, achieving a 1.9$\times$ acceleration over the baseline.

Conclusion: 该方法在针头不可见时仍能有效恢复对齐，提高了超声引导针头插入的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in
robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as
speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust
needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In
this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound
imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many
existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound
images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the
needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based
energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of
plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the
ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the
needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted
on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided
needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and
the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.

Conclusion: SGImagineNav通过想象性场景图和自适应策略，显著提升了语义导航的成功率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantic navigation requires an agent to navigate toward a specified target
in an unseen environment. Employing an imaginative navigation strategy that
predicts future scenes before taking action, can empower the agent to find
target faster. Inspired by this idea, we propose SGImagineNav, a novel
imaginative navigation framework that leverages symbolic world modeling to
proactively build a global environmental representation. SGImagineNav maintains
an evolving hierarchical scene graphs and uses large language models to predict
and explore unseen parts of the environment. While existing methods solely
relying on past observations, this imaginative scene graph provides richer
semantic context, enabling the agent to proactively estimate target locations.
Building upon this, SGImagineNav adopts an adaptive navigation strategy that
exploits semantic shortcuts when promising and explores unknown areas otherwise
to gather additional context. This strategy continuously expands the known
environment and accumulates valuable semantic contexts, ultimately guiding the
agent toward the target. SGImagineNav is evaluated in both real-world scenarios
and simulation benchmarks. SGImagineNav consistently outperforms previous
methods, improving success rate to 65.4 and 66.8 on HM3D and HSSD, and
demonstrating cross-floor and cross-room navigation in real-world environments,
underscoring its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: EGS-SLAM显著提升了GS-SLAM在运动模糊场景下的性能。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) offers a notable improvement over
traditional SLAM methods, enabling photorealistic 3D reconstruction that
conventional approaches often struggle to achieve. However, existing GS-SLAM
systems perform poorly under persistent and severe motion blur commonly
encountered in real-world scenarios, leading to significantly degraded tracking
accuracy and compromised 3D reconstruction quality. To address this limitation,
we propose EGS-SLAM, a novel GS-SLAM framework that fuses event data with RGB-D
inputs to simultaneously reduce motion blur in images and compensate for the
sparse and discrete nature of event streams, enabling robust tracking and
high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Specifically, our system
explicitly models the camera's continuous trajectory during exposure,
supporting event- and blur-aware tracking and mapping on a unified 3D Gaussian
Splatting scene. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable camera response function
to align the dynamic ranges of events and images, along with a no-event loss to
suppress ringing artifacts during reconstruction. We validate our approach on a
new dataset comprising synthetic and real-world sequences with significant
motion blur. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EGS-SLAM
consistently outperforms existing GS-SLAM systems in both trajectory accuracy
and photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. The source code will

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Embodied agents have shown promising generalization capabilities across
diverse physical environments, making them essential for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, building versatile embodied agents poses
critical challenges due to three key issues: dynamic environment perception,
open-ended tool usage, and complex multi-task planning. Most previous works
rely solely on feedback from tool agents to perceive environmental changes and
task status, which limits adaptability to real-time dynamics, causes error
accumulation, and restricts tool flexibility. Furthermore, multi-task
scheduling has received limited attention, primarily due to the inherent
complexity of managing task dependencies and balancing competing priorities in
dynamic and complex environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
$\mathcal{P}^3$, a unified framework that integrates real-time perception and
dynamic scheduling. Specifically, $\mathcal{P}^3$ enables 1) \textbf Perceive
relevant task information actively from the environment, 2) \textbf Plug and
utilize any tool without feedback requirement, and 3) \textbf Plan multi-task
execution based on prioritizing urgent tasks and dynamically adjusting task
order based on dependencies. Extensive real-world experiments show that our
approach bridges the gap between benchmarks and practical deployment,
delivering highly transferable, general-purpose embodied agents. Code and data
will be released soon.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful strategy for planning and
control in autonomous mobile robot navigation. However, ensuring safety in
real-world deployments remains challenging due to the presence of disturbances
and measurement noise. Existing approaches often rely on idealized assumptions,
neglect the impact of noisy measurements, and simply heuristically guess
unrealistic bounds. In this work, we present an efficient and modular robust
MPC design pipeline that systematically addresses these limitations. The
pipeline consists of an iterative procedure that leverages closed-loop
experimental data to estimate disturbance bounds and synthesize a robust
output-feedback MPC scheme. We provide the pipeline in the form of
deterministic and reproducible code to synthesize the robust output-feedback
MPC from data. We empirically demonstrate robust constraint satisfaction and
recursive feasibility in quadrotor simulations using Gazebo.

Abstract: Safe navigation in pedestrian-rich environments remains a key challenge for
autonomous robots. This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based
Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested
across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a
traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and
closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction -
reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and
motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals
discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI
model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the
importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's
promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated
environments.

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging is of great challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs),
since they have to proactively interact with surrounding vehicles to enter the
main road safely within limited time. However, existing decision-making
algorithms fail to adequately address dynamic complexities and social
acceptance of AVs, leading to suboptimal or unsafe merging decisions. To
address this, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic (EGT) merging
decision-making framework, grounded in the bounded rationality of human
drivers, which dynamically balances the benefits of both AVs and main-road
vehicles (MVs). We formulate the cut-in decision-making process as an EGT
problem with a multi-objective payoff function that reflects human-like driving
preferences. By solving the replicator dynamic equation for the evolutionarily
stable strategy (ESS), the optimal cut-in timing is derived, balancing
efficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and MVs. A real-time driving style
estimation algorithm is proposed to adjust the game payoff function online by
observing the immediate reactions of MVs. Empirical results demonstrate that we
improve the efficiency, comfort and safety of both AVs and MVs compared with
existing game-theoretic and traditional planning approaches across multi-object
metrics.

Abstract: DexFruit is a robotic manipulation framework that enables gentle, autonomous
handling of fragile fruit and precise evaluation of damage. Many fruits are
fragile and prone to bruising, thus requiring humans to manually harvest them
with care. In this work, we demonstrate by using optical tactile sensing,
autonomous manipulation of fruit with minimal damage can be achieved. We show
that our tactile informed diffusion policies outperform baselines in both
reduced bruising and pick-and-place success rate across three fruits:
strawberries, tomatoes, and blackberries. In addition, we introduce FruitSplat,
a novel technique to represent and quantify visual damage in high-resolution 3D
representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing metrics for measuring
damage lack quantitative rigor or require expensive equipment. With FruitSplat,
we distill a 2D strawberry mask as well as a 2D bruise segmentation mask into
the 3DGS representation. Furthermore, this representation is modular and
general, compatible with any relevant 2D model. Overall, we demonstrate a 92%
grasping policy success rate, up to a 20% reduction in visual bruising, and up
to an 31% improvement in grasp success rate on challenging fruit compared to
our baselines across our three tested fruits. We rigorously evaluate this
result with over 630 trials. Please checkout our website at

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of novel-view synthesis and motion
reconstruction of dynamic scenes from monocular video, which is critical for
many robotic applications. Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable success in rendering
static scenes, extending them to reconstruct dynamic scenes remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines 3DGS
with a motion trajectory field, enabling precise handling of complex object
motions and achieving physically plausible motion trajectories. By decoupling
dynamic objects from static background, our method compactly optimizes the
motion trajectory field. The approach incorporates time-invariant motion
coefficients and shared motion trajectory bases to capture intricate motion
patterns while minimizing optimization complexity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both
novel-view synthesis and motion trajectory recovery from monocular video,
advancing the capabilities of dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous exploration and navigation remains a critical
challenge in robotics, requiring integrated solutions for localisation,
mapping, decision-making and motion planning. Existing approaches either rely
on strict navigation rules lacking adaptability or on pre-training, which
requires large datasets. These AI methods are often computationally intensive
or based on static assumptions, limiting their adaptability in dynamic or
unknown environments. This paper introduces a bio-inspired agent based on the
Active Inference Framework (AIF), which unifies mapping, localisation, and
adaptive decision-making for autonomous navigation, including exploration and
goal-reaching. Our model creates and updates a topological map of the
environment in real-time, planning goal-directed trajectories to explore or
reach objectives without requiring pre-training. Key contributions include a
probabilistic reasoning framework for interpretable navigation, robust
adaptability to dynamic changes, and a modular ROS2 architecture compatible
with existing navigation systems. Our method was tested in simulated and
real-world environments. The agent successfully explores large-scale simulated
environments and adapts to dynamic obstacles and drift, proving to be
comparable to other exploration strategies such as Gbplanner, FAEL and
Frontiers. This approach offers a scalable and transparent approach for
navigating complex, unstructured environments.

Abstract: Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) such as wires and cables is
crucial in various applications like electronics assembly and medical
surgeries. However, it faces challenges due to DLOs' infinite degrees of
freedom, complex nonlinear dynamics, and the underactuated nature of the
system. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid force-position
strategy for DLO shape control. The framework, combining both force and
position representations of DLO, integrates state trajectory planning in the
force space and Model Predictive Control (MPC) in the position space. We
present a dynamics model with an explicit action encoder, a property extractor
and a graph processor based on Graph Attention Networks. The model is used in
the MPC to enhance prediction accuracy. Results from both simulations and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
achieving efficient and stable shape control of DLOs. Codes and videos are

Result: 仿真实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了无碰撞、平滑、高效且无振荡的轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来与反应控制策略和实际硬件部署的集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Robotic trajectory planning in dynamic and cluttered environments remains a
critical challenge, particularly when striving for both time efficiency and
motion smoothness under actuation constraints. Traditional path planner, such
as Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer
from local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and
oscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address
this limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is
proposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent
potential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local
minima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed
framework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly
minimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints,
ensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is
validated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic
manipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient,
and oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the
efficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle
avoidance approach. This work lays the foundation for future integration with
reactive control strategies and physical hardware deployment in real-world
manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的碰撞模型，利用噪声深度估计作为上下文输入，通过联合训练优化碰撞风险预测，显著提升了单RGB相机在复杂环境中的导航成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单RGB相机在未知环境中导航时缺乏深度信息，导致碰撞检测不可靠。现有方法使用估计的深度构建碰撞地图，但深度估计噪声大，难以直接用于零样本导航。

Method: 提出一种替代方法：将噪声深度估计作为学习碰撞模型的上下文输入，预测机器人执行控制序列时的最小障碍物间隙分布。通过联合训练优化碰撞模型和风险度量，并用于风险感知的MPC规划器。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在真实环境中的导航成功率比NoMaD和ROS堆栈分别提高了9倍和7倍。消融研究验证了设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过联合训练优化碰撞模型和风险度量，显著提升了单RGB相机在复杂环境中的导航性能。

Abstract: Navigating unknown environments with a single RGB camera is challenging, as
the lack of depth information prevents reliable collision-checking. While some
methods use estimated depth to build collision maps, we found that depth
estimates from vision foundation models are too noisy for zero-shot navigation
in cluttered environments.
  We propose an alternative approach: instead of using noisy estimated depth
for direct collision-checking, we use it as a rich context input to a learned
collision model. This model predicts the distribution of minimum obstacle
clearance that the robot can expect for a given control sequence. At inference,
these predictions inform a risk-aware MPC planner that minimizes estimated
collision risk. Our joint learning pipeline co-trains the collision model and
risk metric using both safe and unsafe trajectories. Crucially, our
joint-training ensures optimal variance in our collision model that improves
navigation in highly cluttered environments. Consequently, real-world
experiments show 9x and 7x improvements in success rates over NoMaD and the ROS
stack, respectively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Result: AgriVLN在短指令上表现良好，长指令通过STL模块将成功率从0.33提升至0.47。

Conclusion: AgriVLN在农业领域表现最优，填补了农业场景导航的空白。

Abstract: Agricultural robots have emerged as powerful members in agricultural tasks,
nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway
for movement, resulting in limited mobility and poor adaptability.
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target
destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong
performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or
methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap,
we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560
episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB
videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of
0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we
propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN)
baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted
templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural
environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When
evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles
with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the
instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose
Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into
AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare
AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art
performance in the agricultural domain.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to write policy code for controlling
robots has gained significant attention. However, in long-horizon implicative
tasks, this approach often results in API parameter, comments and sequencing
errors, leading to task failure. To address this problem, we propose a
collaborative Triple-S framework that involves multiple LLMs. Through
In-Context Learning, different LLMs assume specific roles in a closed-loop
Simplification-Solution-Summary process, effectively improving success rates
and robustness in long-horizon implicative tasks. Additionally, a novel
demonstration library update mechanism which learned from success allows it to
generalize to previously failed tasks. We validate the framework in the
Long-horizon Desktop Implicative Placement (LDIP) dataset across various
baseline models, where Triple-S successfully executes 89% of tasks in both
observable and partially observable scenarios. Experiments in both simulation
and real-world robot settings further validated the effectiveness of Triple-S.

Abstract: Equipped with Large Language Models (LLMs), human-centered robots are now
capable of performing a wide range of tasks that were previously deemed
challenging or unattainable. However, merely completing tasks is insufficient
for cognitive robots, who should learn and apply human preferences to future
scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework that combines human preferences
with physical constraints, requiring robots to complete tasks while considering
both. Firstly, we developed a benchmark of everyday household activities, which
are often evaluated based on specific preferences. We then introduced
In-Context Learning from Human Feedback (ICLHF), where human feedback comes
from direct instructions and adjustments made intentionally or unintentionally
in daily life. Extensive sets of experiments, testing the ICLHF to generate
task plans and balance physical constraints with preferences, have demonstrated
the efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: The deployment of humanoid robots in unstructured, human-centric environments
requires navigation capabilities that extend beyond simple locomotion to
include robust perception, provable safety, and socially aware behavior.
Current reinforcement learning approaches are often limited by blind
controllers that lack environmental awareness or by vision-based systems that
fail to perceive complex 3D obstacles. In this work, we present an end-to-end
locomotion policy that directly maps raw, spatio-temporal LiDAR point clouds to
motor commands, enabling robust navigation in cluttered dynamic scenes. We
formulate the control problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)
to formally separate safety from task objectives. Our key contribution is a
novel methodology that translates the principles of Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) into costs within the CMDP, allowing a model-free Penalized Proximal
Policy Optimization (P3O) to enforce safety constraints during training.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of comfort-oriented rewards, grounded in
human-robot interaction research, to promote motions that are smooth,
predictable, and less intrusive. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework
through a successful sim-to-real transfer to a physical humanoid robot, which
exhibits agile and safe navigation around both static and dynamic 3D obstacles.

in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new
environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing
datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered
in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects,
negatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.
  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to
generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO,
despite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose
Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to
infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical
characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object
types compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.
  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp
Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp
estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively
expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC)
enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic
projection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object
types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86% average accuracy (12.2%
gain over edge-only), and 2.2x faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone.

TL;DR: GraphCoT-VLA 是一个高效的端到端视觉-语言-动作模型，通过结构化思维链推理模块和实时更新的3D姿态-物体图，显著提升了任务成功率和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在处理模糊语言指令和未知环境状态时表现不足，且感知局限于静态二维观察，缺乏三维交互建模能力。

Method: 设计了结构化思维链推理模块（结合任务理解、失败反馈和低层次推理）和实时更新的3D姿态-物体图，并采用混合推理策略。

Result: 在多个真实机器人任务中，GraphCoT-VLA在任务成功率和响应速度上显著优于现有方法，表现出强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GraphCoT-VLA通过增强推理能力和三维交互建模，有效解决了现有VLA模型的局限性，适用于开放环境和不确定指令。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models have emerged as a crucial paradigm in robotic
manipulation. However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in
handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states.
Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional
observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions
between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's
ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we
design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates
high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level
imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions.
Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which
captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological
relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better
understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout
hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental
results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and
response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open
environments and under uncertain instructions.

TL;DR: MoRoCo是一个统一框架，用于在多操作员、多机器人系统中实现受限通信下的在线协调与探索，支持三种协调模式切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在通信受限的环境中，现有研究忽视了人类操作员与机器人团队的实时交互需求，亟需一种支持双向、上下文感知交互的协调框架。

Method: 提出MoRoCo框架，通过分布式算法管理三种协调模式（spread、migrate、chain），仅依赖本地通信实现自适应切换。

Result: 大规模仿真与硬件实验验证了MoRoCo在受限通信下实现高效、可靠协调的能力，并强调了人机交互的必要性。

Conclusion: MoRoCo为复杂环境中人机协同的多机器人自主性提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots are increasingly deployed alongside multiple
human operators to explore unknown environments, identify salient features, and
perform complex tasks in scenarios such as subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, and search-and-rescue missions. In these contexts,
communication is often severely limited to short-range exchanges via ad-hoc
networks, posing challenges to coordination. While recent studies have
addressed multi-robot exploration under communication constraints, they largely
overlook the essential role of human operators and their real-time interaction
with robotic teams. Operators may demand timely updates on the exploration
progress and robot status, reprioritize or cancel tasks dynamically, or request
live video feeds and control access. Conversely, robots may seek human
confirmation for anomalous events or require help recovering from motion or
planning failures. To enable such bilateral, context-aware interactions under
restricted communication, this work proposes MoRoCo, a unified framework for
online coordination and exploration in multi-operator, multi-robot systems.
MoRoCo enables the team to adaptively switch among three coordination modes:
spread mode for parallelized exploration with intermittent data sharing,
migrate mode for coordinated relocation, and chain mode for maintaining
high-bandwidth connectivity through multi-hop links. These transitions are
managed through distributed algorithms via only local communication. Extensive
large-scale human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments validate the
necessity of incorporating human robot interactions and demonstrate that MoRoCo
enables efficient, reliable coordination under limited communication, marking a
significant step toward robust human-in-the-loop multi-robot autonomy in
challenging environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单智能体端到端驾驶系统因遮挡和有限感知范围导致危险驾驶，且黑盒特性使其行为难以解释。

Method: RiskMM利用Transformer架构构建多智能体时空表示，通过注意力建模环境交互生成风险感知表示，并结合基于学习的模型预测控制（MPC）模块。

Result: 在V2XPnP-Seq数据集上的评估表明，RiskMM在风险感知轨迹规划中表现优越且鲁棒，显著提升了框架的可解释性。

Conclusion: RiskMM通过风险地图和MPC的结合，实现了高性能和可解释的协作端到端驾驶，代码将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: End-to-end paradigm has emerged as a promising approach to autonomous
driving. However, existing single-agent end-to-end pipelines are often
constrained by occlusion and limited perception range, resulting in hazardous
driving. Furthermore, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of
the driving behavior, leading to an untrustworthiness system. To address these
limitations, we introduce Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM) and propose an
interpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns
directly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal
representation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the
interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for
downstream planning. RiskMM first constructs a multi-agent spatiotemporal
representation with unified Transformer-based architecture, then derives
risk-aware representations by modeling interactions among surrounding
environments with attention. These representations are subsequently fed into a
learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) module. The MPC planner
inherently accommodates physical constraints and different vehicle types and
can provide interpretation by aligning learned parameters with explicit MPC
elements. Evaluations conducted on the real-world V2XPnP-Seq dataset confirm
that RiskMM achieves superior and robust performance in risk-aware trajectory
planning, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the cooperative
end-to-end driving framework. The codebase will be released to facilitate
future research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 六足机器人在复杂地形中表现优异，但在简单地形中缺乏快速步态，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 设计了三种控制方法：基于运动学的、模型预测的和强化学习的控制器，并在实验室和火星模拟任务中测试。

Result: LAURON VI通过快速步态策略显著提升了六足机器人在多种实际应用中的适用性。

Conclusion: 动态步态和自主控制的研究使六足机器人在更广泛的实际场景中更具潜力。

Abstract: Legged locomotion enables robotic systems to traverse extremely challenging
terrains. In many real-world scenarios, the terrain is not that difficult and
these mixed terrain types introduce the need for flexible use of different
walking strategies to achieve mission goals in a fast, reliable, and
energy-efficient way. Six-legged robots have a high degree of flexibility and
inherent stability that aids them in traversing even some of the most difficult
terrains, such as collapsed buildings. However, their lack of fast walking
gaits for easier surfaces is one reason why they are not commonly applied in
these scenarios.
  This work presents LAURON VI, a six-legged robot platform for research on
dynamic walking gaits as well as on autonomy for complex field missions. The
robot's 18 series elastic joint actuators offer high-frequency interfaces for
Cartesian impedance and pure torque control. We have designed, implemented, and
compared three control approaches: kinematic-based, model-predictive, and
reinforcement-learned controllers. The robot hardware and the different control
approaches were extensively tested in a lab environment as well as on a Mars
analog mission. The introduction of fast locomotion strategies for LAURON VI
makes six-legged robots vastly more suitable for a wide range of real-world
applications.

Result: 仿真和实验验证了方案的潜力，实现了载荷的流畅协作操控。

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了起重机载荷精确定位的难题，提升了操作安全性和效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a scheme to enhance payload manipulation using a robot
collaborating with an overhead crane. In the current industrial practice, when
the crane's payload has to be accurately manipulated and located in a desired
position, the task becomes laborious and risky since the operators have to
guide the fine motions of the payload by hand. In the proposed collaborative
scheme, the crane lifts the payload while the robot's end-effector guides it
toward the desired position. The only link between the robot and the crane is
the interaction force produced during the guiding of the payload. Two
admittance transfer functions are considered to accomplish harmless and smooth
contact with the payload. The first is used in a position-based admittance
control integrated with the robot. The second one adds compliance to the crane
by processing the interaction force through the admittance transfer function to
generate a crane's velocity command that makes the crane follow the payload.
Then the robot's end-effector and the crane move collaboratively to guide the
payload to the desired location. A method is presented to design the admittance
controllers that accomplish a fluent robot-crane collaboration. Simulations and
experiments validating the scheme potential are shown.

Motivation: 解决无人机在物流中因电池寿命、载重和飞行时间限制而需要地面支持的问题。

Method: 结合VLM和RAG调整阻抗控制参数，无人机作为领导者使用APF规划，地面机器人通过虚拟阻抗链接跟随。

Result: 系统成功率达92%，VLM-RAG在光照良好时物体检测准确率8%，地面机器人能安全避开短障碍物。

Conclusion: SwarmVLM展示了异构导航中无人机与地面机器人协作的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demand for efficient logistics, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) are increasingly being paired with automated guided vehicles (AGVs).
While UAVs offer the ability to navigate through dense environments and varying
altitudes, they are limited by battery life, payload capacity, and flight
duration, necessitating coordinated ground support.
  Focusing on heterogeneous navigation, SwarmVLM addresses these limitations by
enabling semantic collaboration between UAVs and ground robots through
impedance control. The system leverages the Vision Language Model (VLM) and the
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to adjust impedance control parameters in
response to environmental changes. In this framework, the UAV acts as a leader
using Artificial Potential Field (APF) planning for real-time navigation, while
the ground robot follows via virtual impedance links with adaptive link
topology to avoid collisions with short obstacles.
  The system demonstrated a 92% success rate across 12 real-world trials. Under
optimal lighting conditions, the VLM-RAG framework achieved 8% accuracy in
object detection and selection of impedance parameters. The mobile robot
prioritized short obstacle avoidance, occasionally resulting in a lateral
deviation of up to 50 cm from the UAV path, which showcases safe navigation in
a cluttered setting.

Motivation: 探索机器人通过触觉和听觉结合的方式传达情感和社交手势的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发了一个包含25个振动电机和音频播放的多模态系统，通过振动、声音或其组合呈现十种情感和六种社交手势，32名参与者评估了刺激的唤醒度和效价。

Result: 多模态显著提高了解码准确性；触觉和听觉各自对某些情感识别有优势；手势单独传达情感效果较差。

Conclusion: 多感官整合在情感人机交互中至关重要，触觉和听觉线索在情感传达中具有互补作用。

Abstract: Affective tactile interaction constitutes a fundamental component of human
communication. In natural human-human encounters, touch is seldom experienced
in isolation; rather, it is inherently multisensory. Individuals not only
perceive the physical sensation of touch but also register the accompanying
auditory cues generated through contact. The integration of haptic and auditory
information forms a rich and nuanced channel for emotional expression. While
extensive research has examined how robots convey emotions through facial
expressions and speech, their capacity to communicate social gestures and
emotions via touch remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we
developed a multimodal interaction system incorporating a 5*5 grid of 25
vibration motors synchronized with audio playback, enabling robots to deliver
combined haptic-audio stimuli. In an experiment involving 32 Chinese
participants, ten emotions and six social gestures were presented through
vibration, sound, or their combination. Participants rated each stimulus on
arousal and valence scales. The results revealed that (1) the combined
haptic-audio modality significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to
single modalities; (2) each individual channel-vibration or sound-effectively
supported certain emotions recognition, with distinct advantages depending on
the emotional expression; and (3) gestures alone were generally insufficient
for conveying clearly distinguishable emotions. These findings underscore the
importance of multisensory integration in affective human-robot interaction and
highlight the complementary roles of haptic and auditory cues in enhancing
emotional communication.

Conclusion: DETACH通过双流解耦有效解决了长时程任务的跨领域泛化问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex
multi-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making,
and extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However,
existing methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained
subtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking
the ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,
failing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,
this paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via
biologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's
"where-what" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an
environment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object
functions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain
transfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill
learning module for task execution, which processes self-state information
including joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill
transfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive
experiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods,
DETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and
average execution efficiency improvement of 29%.

Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for
context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by
calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded
architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is
facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental
results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42

Conclusion: MolmoAct是当前最先进的机器人基础模型，通过结构化推理将感知转化为有目的的动作，同时开源了模型和数据集。

Abstract: Reasoning is central to purposeful action, yet most robotic foundation models
map perception and instructions directly to control, which limits adaptability,
generalization, and semantic grounding. We introduce Action Reasoning Models
(ARMs), a class of vision-language-action models that integrate perception,
planning, and control through a structured three-stage pipeline. Our model,
MolmoAct, encodes observations and instructions into depth-aware perception
tokens, generates mid-level spatial plans as editable trajectory traces, and
predicts precise low-level actions, enabling explainable and steerable
behavior. MolmoAct-7B-D achieves strong performance across simulation and
real-world settings: 70.5% zero-shot accuracy on SimplerEnv Visual Matching
tasks, surpassing closed-source Pi-0 and GR00T N1; 86.6% average success on
LIBERO, including an additional 6.3% gain over ThinkAct on long-horizon tasks;
and in real-world fine-tuning, an additional 10% (single-arm) and an additional
22.7% (bimanual) task progression over Pi-0-FAST. It also outperforms baselines
by an additional 23.3% on out-of-distribution generalization and achieves top
human-preference scores for open-ended instruction following and trajectory
steering. Furthermore, we release, for the first time, the MolmoAct Dataset --
a mid-training robot dataset comprising over 10,000 high quality robot
trajectories across diverse scenarios and tasks. Training with this dataset
yields an average 5.5% improvement in general performance over the base model.
We release all model weights, training code, our collected dataset, and our
action reasoning dataset, establishing MolmoAct as both a state-of-the-art
robotics foundation model and an open blueprint for building ARMs that
transform perception into purposeful action through structured reasoning.

Conclusion: PCHands为跨机械手的灵巧操作提供了一种高效且通用的表示方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a common representation for dexterous
manipulation across manipulators of different morphologies. To this end, we
propose PCHands, a novel approach for extracting hand postural synergies from a
large set of manipulators. We define a simplified and unified description
format based on anchor positions for manipulators ranging from 2-finger
grippers to 5-finger anthropomorphic hands. This enables learning a
variable-length latent representation of the manipulator configuration and the
alignment of the end-effector frame of all manipulators. We show that it is
possible to extract principal components from this latent representation that
is universal across manipulators of different structures and degrees of
freedom. To evaluate PCHands, we use this compact representation to encode
observation and action spaces of control policies for dexterous manipulation
tasks learned with RL. In terms of learning efficiency and consistency, the
proposed representation outperforms a baseline that learns the same tasks in
joint space. We additionally show that PCHands performs robustly in RL from
demonstration, when demonstrations are provided from a different manipulator.
We further support our results with real-world experiments that involve a
2-finger gripper and a 4-finger anthropomorphic hand. Code and additional
material are available at https://hsp-iit.github.io/PCHands/.

Abstract: This paper proposes a strategy to encircle and intercept a non-cooperative
aerial point-mass moving target by leveraging noisy range measurements for
state estimation. In this approach, the guardians actively ensure the
observability of the target by using an anti-synchronization (AS), 3D
``vibrating string" trajectory, which enables rapid position and velocity
estimation based on the Kalman filter. Additionally, a novel anti-target
controller is designed for the guardians to enable adaptive transitions from
encircling a protected target to encircling, intercepting, and neutralizing a
hostile target, taking into consideration the input constraints of the
guardians. Based on the guaranteed uniform observability, the exponentially
bounded stability of the state estimation error and the convergence of the
encirclement error are rigorously analyzed. Simulation results and real-world
UAV experiments are presented to further validate the effectiveness of the
system design.

Motivation: 地面机器人在复杂地形中导航时易因翻覆而失败，需平衡安全性与效率。

Method: 分析机器人翻覆稳定性，定义可通行方向，并将其作为约束融入轨迹优化，使用图求解器生成轨迹。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，CAP优于现有方法，提升了机器人在不平地形的导航性能。

Conclusion: CAP通过翻覆感知约束实现了复杂地形下的安全高效导航。

Abstract: It is a challenging task for ground robots to autonomously navigate in harsh
environments due to the presence of non-trivial obstacles and uneven terrain.
This requires trajectory planning that balances safety and efficiency. The
primary challenge is to generate a feasible trajectory that prevents robot from
tip-over while ensuring effective navigation. In this paper, we propose a
capsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the
uneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is
analyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable
orientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations. This
orientation is then incorporated into a capsizing-safety constraint for
trajectory optimization. We employ a graph-based solver to compute a robust and
feasible trajectory while adhering to the capsizing-safety constraint.
Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that CAP outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches, providing enhanced navigation performance
on uneven terrains.

TL;DR: AimBot是一种轻量级视觉增强技术，通过叠加空间提示（如射击线和准星）到多视角RGB图像中，提升机器人操作的视觉运动策略学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作中，视觉运动策略学习常因缺乏明确的空间关系提示而受限。AimBot旨在通过视觉增强提供辅助空间引导。

Method: AimBot利用深度图像、相机外参和末端执行器姿态计算叠加内容，替换原始RGB图像，无需改变模型架构，计算开销极小（<1ms）。

Result: 实验表明，AimBot在仿真和真实环境中均能显著提升多种视觉运动策略的性能。

Conclusion: AimBot通过空间视觉反馈的简单增强，有效提升了机器人操作的策略学习效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AimBot, a lightweight visual augmentation technique
that provides explicit spatial cues to improve visuomotor policy learning in
robotic manipulation. AimBot overlays shooting lines and scope reticles onto
multi-view RGB images, offering auxiliary visual guidance that encodes the
end-effector's state. The overlays are computed from depth images, camera
extrinsics, and the current end-effector pose, explicitly conveying spatial
relationships between the gripper and objects in the scene. AimBot incurs
minimal computational overhead (less than 1 ms) and requires no changes to
model architectures, as it simply replaces original RGB images with augmented
counterparts. Despite its simplicity, our results show that AimBot consistently
improves the performance of various visuomotor policies in both simulation and
real-world settings, highlighting the benefits of spatially grounded visual
feedback.

Motivation: 随着资源受限移动平台的快速发展，对高效神经网络控制器的需求增加，但传统深度神经网络的计算复杂性和内存需求限制了其在边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 采用组件感知的结构化剪枝方法，结合数学稳定性保证（如Lyapunov准则），在TD-MPC算法上验证压缩效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效降低模型复杂度，同时保持控制性能和稳定性，并确定了安全压缩比的上限。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下压缩NNC的部署提供了理论框架和实践指导。

Abstract: The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile
robots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the
demand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can
operate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs)
demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial
computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers
to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive
model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning
to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a
balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is
rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC),
a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a
systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties,
specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in
providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of
model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental
validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model
complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability
characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary
for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine
the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability
properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in
resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Off-road navigation is an important capability for mobile robots deployed in

repeatable benchmark environment, Verti-Arena supports reproducible experiments
across a variety of vertically challenging terrains and provides precise ground
truth measurements through onboard sensors and a motion capture system.
Verti-Arena also supports consistent data collection and comparative evaluation
of algorithms in off-road autonomy research. We also develop a web-based
interface that enables research groups worldwide to remotely conduct
standardized off-road autonomy experiments on Verti-Arena.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon mobile manipulation has long been a grand
challenge in embodied semantic reasoning, generalizable manipulation, and
adaptive locomotion. Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,
although large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task
planning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to
tabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited
actuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies
exhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object
configurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for
practical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform
maneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings
remains understudied.
  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for
agile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates
high-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the
challenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce
a hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling
long-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the
control level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across
challenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon
mobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through
successful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and
robustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged
manipulators in unstructured environments. Our work advances the feasibility of
generalized robotic assistants capable of complex, dynamic tasks. Our project

Abstract: Learning skills from human motions offers a promising path toward
generalizable policies for whole-body humanoid control, yet two key
cornerstones are missing: (1) a high-quality motion tracking framework that
faithfully transforms large-scale kinematic references into robust and
extremely dynamic motions on real hardware, and (2) a distillation approach
that can effectively learn these motion primitives and compose them to solve
downstream tasks. We address these gaps with BeyondMimic, the first real-world
framework to learn from human motions for versatile and naturalistic humanoid
control via guided diffusion. Our framework provides a motion tracking pipeline
capable of challenging skills such as jumping spins, sprinting, and cartwheels
with state-of-the-art motion quality. Moving beyond mimicking existing motions
and synthesize novel ones, we further introduce a unified diffusion policy that
enables zero-shot task-specific control at test time using simple cost
functions. Deployed on hardware, BeyondMimic performs diverse tasks at test
time, including waypoint navigation, joystick teleoperation, and obstacle
avoidance, bridging sim-to-real motion tracking and flexible synthesis of human
motion primitives for whole-body control. https://beyondmimic.github.io/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的生存建模理论，将生存视为生物状态空间中的几何属性，而非外部标注的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存建模依赖标注数据和固定协变量，而本文认为生存是生物状态空间几何特性的自然结果。

Method: 提出自组织生存流形（SOSM）理论，基于低曲率测地流和生物约束构建生存能量泛函。

Result: 证明了在生物合理条件下，生存对齐轨迹的涌现和收敛，并将健康、疾病等视为流形结构的几何相变。

Conclusion: 该理论为无标注生存建模提供了通用框架，连接了机器学习、生物物理和生命几何学。

Abstract: Survival is traditionally modeled as a supervised learning task, reliant on
curated outcome labels and fixed covariates. This work rejects that premise. It
proposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric
consequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in
biological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival
Manifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature
geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A
survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is
introduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric
flow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective
and prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of
survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The
framework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci
curvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.
Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions
in the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free
foundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging
machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.

Result: 在DataCo智能供应链数据集上，F1-score达到0.817，误报率低于3.0%。

Conclusion: 该方法结合无监督预筛选和半监督优化，在真实场景中高效有效，但需进一步解决概念漂移问题并与深度学习方法比较。

Abstract: Detecting fraud in modern supply chains is a growing challenge, driven by the
complexity of global networks and the scarcity of labeled data. Traditional
detection methods often struggle with class imbalance and limited supervision,
reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a
novel two-phase learning framework to address these challenges. In the first
phase, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs unsupervised anomaly detection
to identify potential fraud cases and reduce the volume of data requiring
further analysis. In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine
(SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence
pseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed
method is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive
real-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score
of 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised
pre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection
under real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding
concept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology,
with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness

critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model
performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as
a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward
frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)
to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and
generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive
performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，HGMN在节点分类任务中优于现有GNN方法。

Conclusion: HGMN通过有效融合角色特征和邻接信息，提供了更丰富的节点表示，适用于多种图学习任务。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant
attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However,
traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,
often overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for
learning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing
role-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal
performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively
integrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN
utilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships
and combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable
mamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction
methods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the
connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's
representational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution
layers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph
structures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we
incorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature
propagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly
introduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of
HGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node
classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results
highlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by
effectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information,
making it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning
applications.

Conclusion: RGVQ通过软分配和结构感知正则化，有效解决了图VQ的码本崩溃问题，提升了图令牌的表达和可迁移性。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for
learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a
fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the
graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of
graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that
codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with
mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why
graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical
analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by
redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing
optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose
RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity
as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote
token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax
reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In
addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to
penalize the token co-assignments among similar node pairs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization
and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones
across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable
graph token representations.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems play a crucial role in analyzing
neuroimaging data for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However,
small-sample studies suffer from low reproducibility, while large-scale
datasets introduce confounding heterogeneity due to multiple disease subtypes
being labeled under a single category. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel federated learning framework tailored for neuroimaging CAD systems. Our
approach includes a dynamic navigation module that routes samples to the most
suitable local models based on latent subtype representations, and a
meta-integration module that combines predictions from heterogeneous local
models into a unified diagnostic output. We evaluated our framework using a
comprehensive dataset comprising fMRI data from over 1300 MDD patients and 1100
healthy controls across multiple study cohorts. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness
compared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an
average accuracy of 74.06\% across all tested sites, showcasing its
effectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model
generalizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the
dynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance. By
addressing data heterogeneity and subtype confounding, our framework advances
reliable and reproducible neuroimaging CAD systems, offering significant
potential for personalized medicine and clinical decision-making in neurology
and psychiatry.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling
new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their
application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly
multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present
a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature
from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and
materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials.
We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and
Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and
adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model
(BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a
Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and
translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference
protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query,
surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach
through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,
and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the
fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and
measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived
adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive
real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced
transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are
vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors
by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust
science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning
methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs
resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this
paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from
training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more
tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable
data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for
minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple
6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial
resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M
tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training
baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to
unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized
dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when
it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a
need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish
pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI
systems.

Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by
statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in
synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process
gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often
spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion
models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,
which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new
perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into
constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two
distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be
mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.
Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial
phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local
denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an
information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on
conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a
real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures
of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small
local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are
only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This

*Md Arafat Hossain,Xingfu Wu,Valerie Taylor,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于密集和稀疏大型语言模型的通用扩展法则，以统一现有框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型规模和训练计算成本的指数增长，优化模型规模预测和资源分配仍具挑战性。

Method: 重新审视现有扩展法则，提出通用扩展法则，并评估其有效性。

Result: 验证了通用扩展法则在密集和稀疏模型中的适用性。

Conclusion: 通用扩展法则为大型语言模型的扩展提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially,
as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth
has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the
efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally
predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge.
Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling
laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In
this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling
law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse
large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with
existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: ANTIDOTE是一种针对噪声标签学习的新目标函数，通过信息差异邻域的松弛定义，利用凸对偶性转化为对抗训练方法，计算成本接近标准交叉熵损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练数据中标签噪声或对抗性标签修改的问题，提升模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过信息差异邻域的松弛定义目标函数，利用凸对偶性转化为对抗训练方法。

Result: 在对称、非对称、人工标注和真实世界标签噪声下表现优异，计算效率接近标准交叉熵损失。

Conclusion: ANTIDOTE能自适应减少噪声标签样本的影响，性能优于同类方法，计算成本低。

Abstract: We introduce ANTIDOTE, a new class of objectives for learning under noisy
labels which are defined in terms of a relaxation over an
information-divergence neighborhood. Using convex duality, we provide a
reformulation as an adversarial training method that has similar computational
cost to training with standard cross-entropy loss. We show that our approach
adaptively reduces the influence of the samples with noisy labels during
learning, exhibiting a behavior that is analogous to forgetting those samples.
ANTIDOTE is effective in practical environments where label noise is inherent
in the training data or where an adversary can alter the training labels.
Extensive empirical evaluations on different levels of symmetric, asymmetric,
human annotation, and real-world label noise show that ANTIDOTE outperforms
leading comparable losses in the field and enjoys a time complexity that is
very close to that of the standard cross entropy loss.

Motivation: PDAC早期检测困难，缺乏特异性症状和可靠生物标志物。

Method: 结合神经控制微分方程、预训练语言模型、循环网络和交叉注意力机制，整合诊断代码和实验室数据。

Result: 在4700名患者数据集上，AUC提升6.5%至15.5%，并识别出高风险诊断代码和实验室指标。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升PDAC早期检测能力，发现新生物标志物。

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and
early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of
specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new
multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and
routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to
detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines
neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series,
pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code
trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture
interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach
on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant
improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels
associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new
biomarkers. Our code is available at

Result: 实证验证表明，该估计器在计算社会科学的不同回归任务中具有显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成数据与真实数据的交互可以改进参数估计，为有限数据条件下的研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being
explored as an aid to computational social science and human subject research
in limited data regimes. While previous technical work has explored the
potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled
manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate
entirely new synthetic samples (also termed as synthetic simulations), such as
in responses to surveys. However, it is not immediately clear by what means
practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce
statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this work, we introduce a new
estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a
hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address the
challenge at hand. Surprisingly, we find that interactions between the moment
residuals of synthetic data and those of real data can improve estimates of the
target parameter. We empirically validate the finite-sample performance of our
estimator across different regression tasks in computational social science
applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种自适应阈值框架（SCS和MACS），用于非平稳时间序列中的异常检测，显著提升了F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态阈值在非平稳环境中容易失效，需要适应统计特性随时间变化的场景。

Method: 提出了两种框架：SCS和MACS，结合统计在线学习和分段原理，实现局部自适应。

Result: 在Wafer Manufacturing数据集上，F1分数显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值框架能可靠、可解释地检测多样化的真实异常。

Abstract: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such as
manufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adapt
to nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time.
Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts,
concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we
introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks:
Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence
Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation
principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees
on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across
Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement
compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work
demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable
reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于通用序列映射（USM）的双射分形编码方法，解决了迭代过程中的种子偏差问题，并揭示了USM作为高效数值过程的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的语言模型（如ChatGPT）的兴起，探索多尺度和嵌入维度的符号序列数值表示方法变得重要。USM旨在解决保留符号序列上下文信息的挑战。

Method: USM由两个混沌游戏表示（CGR）组成，通过前向和后向迭代将符号序列双射编码到数值空间，并投影到频域（FCGR）。该方法支持Chebyshev距离和k-mer频率的计算。

Result: 解决了种子偏差问题，实现了数值定位与序列身份的全协调，并发现USM是一种高效收敛于稳态序列嵌入的数值过程。

Conclusion: USM不仅适用于基因组序列（4核苷酸字母表），还可轻松扩展到任意基数字母表。

Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers,
popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding
procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and
embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for
mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of
individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as
neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively
encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of
two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that
can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM
coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer
frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,
paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal
Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.
The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing
outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;
and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging
towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results
for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation
defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless,
the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be
straightforward.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has become essential for securely sharing and

often fail to adequately preserve privacy. We introduce the Tabular
Auto-Regressive Generative Network (TabularARGN), a neural network architecture
specifically designed for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data. Using
a discretization-based auto-regressive approach, TabularARGN achieves high data
fidelity while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate TabularARGN
against existing synthetic data generation methods, showing competitive results
in statistical similarity, machine learning utility, and detection robustness.
We further perform an in-depth privacy evaluation using systematic
membership-inference attacks, highlighting the robustness and effective
privacy-utility balance of our approach.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了样本效率，并在未见过的稀疏奖励环境中实现零样本适应。

Conclusion: 学习可迁移的通信表示是有效的，CORAL框架为强化学习的泛化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks
and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned
representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training
environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work
formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces
CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a
transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning
from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world
model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task
reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise
messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal
Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next
action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed
contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by
interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample
efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of
pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the
efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

Conclusion: KANs有潜力增强GNN表达能力，并实现高效、无图推理。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance on
graph-structured data, but their reliance on graph connectivity often limits
scalability and efficiency. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a recent
architecture with learnable univariate functions, offer strong nonlinear
expressiveness and efficient inference. In this work, we integrate KANs into
three popular GNN architectures-GAT, SGC, and APPNP-resulting in three new
models: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP. We further adopt a multi-teacher knowledge
amalgamation framework, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is
distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that the proposed models improve node classification accuracy,
and the knowledge amalgamation approach significantly boosts student model
performance. Our findings highlight the potential of KANs for enhancing GNN
expressiveness and for enabling efficient, graph-free inference.

Motivation: 随着机器学习中知识产权保护的重要性增加，现有水印方法无法适应KAN的新型架构，因此需要一种专门的水印方法。

Method: 提出DCT-AW方法，通过离散余弦变换扰动激活输出嵌入水印，适用于KAN的可学习激活函数。

Result: 实验表明DCT-AW对模型性能影响小，且能抵抗微调、剪枝等水印去除攻击。

Conclusion: DCT-AW是一种适用于KAN的有效水印方法，兼具任务独立性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the increasing importance of protecting intellectual property in machine
learning, watermarking techniques have gained significant attention. As
advanced models are increasingly deployed in domains such as social network
analysis, the need for robust model protection becomes even more critical.
While existing watermarking methods have demonstrated effectiveness for
conventional deep neural networks, they often fail to adapt to the novel
architecture, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which feature learnable
activation functions. KAN holds strong potential for modeling complex
relationships in network-structured data. However, their unique design also
introduces new challenges for watermarking. Therefore, we propose a novel
watermarking method, Discrete Cosine Transform-based Activation Watermarking
(DCT-AW), tailored for KAN. Leveraging the learnable activation functions of
KAN, our method embeds watermarks by perturbing activation outputs using
discrete cosine transform, ensuring compatibility with diverse tasks and
achieving task independence. Experimental results demonstrate that DCT-AW has a
small impact on model performance and provides superior robustness against
various watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and
retraining after pruning.

TL;DR: HeteRo-Select框架通过智能选择客户端子集，提升联邦学习的性能和稳定性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因客户端数据多样性导致的训练不稳定问题。

Method: 提出HeteRo-Select框架，基于客户端有用性、公平性、更新速度和数据多样性进行评分选择。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，HeteRo-Select的峰值准确率为74.75%，最终准确率为72.76%，稳定性下降仅1.99%。

Conclusion: HeteRo-Select是解决异构联邦学习问题的可靠方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that often suffers
from training instability due to the diverse nature of client data. Although
utility-based client selection methods like Oort are used to converge by
prioritizing high-loss clients, they frequently experience significant drops in
accuracy during later stages of training. We propose a theoretical
HeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure
long-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that
when client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart
subset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively
compared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,
step-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update
speed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong
regularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under
significant label skew ($\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The
HeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak
accuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. Specifically, HeteRo-Select
achieves a peak accuracy of $74.75\%$, a final accuracy of $72.76\%$, and a
minimal stability drop of $1.99\%$. In contrast, Oort records a lower peak
accuracy of $73.98\%$, a final accuracy of $71.25\%$, and a larger stability
drop of $2.73\%$. The theoretical foundations and empirical performance in our
study make HeteRo-Select a reliable solution for real-world heterogeneous FL
problems.

TL;DR: CISO是一种基于深度学习的物种分布建模方法，能够结合不完整的物种观察数据与环境变量，提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物种分布模型（SDMs）通常忽略物种间的生物相互作用，且现有方法假设对称的成对关系或需要完整的共现数据。CISO旨在解决这些限制。

Method: CISO利用深度学习，允许预测基于不完整的物种观察数据与环境变量，适用于不同数据集（如植物、鸟类和蝴蝶）。

Result: CISO在空间分离的测试集上表现优于其他方法，尤其在结合多个数据集时预测性能更佳。

Conclusion: CISO是一种有前景的生态工具，能够整合不完整的生物信息并识别不同类群间的潜在相互作用。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species'
geographic distributions, serving as critical tools for ecological research and
conservation planning. Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to
environmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,
precipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also
strongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often
overlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by
incorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise
relationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In
practice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information
about the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across
locations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based
method for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species
Observations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number
of species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the
variability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our
approach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen
for plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for
butterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information
improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When
conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms
alternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.
Furthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can
improve performance. CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of
incorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential
interactions between species from disparate taxa.

*Connor Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种鲁棒的Lyapunov框架，用于分析Schedule-Free（SF）方法在非凸优化中的性能，无需依赖全局假设，并提供了与时间无关的收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的一阶方法依赖于预先知道总时间步长T的步长调度，而SF方法通过结合Polyak-Ruppert平均和动量，实现了与T无关的超参数设置，但其在非凸优化中的分析有限。

Method: 引入Lyapunov框架，仅需L-光滑性和下界假设，将SF分析简化为单步下降不等式，从而得到非凸情况下的收敛率。

Result: 证明了多种收敛率：O(1/log T)（常数步长+PR平均）、O(log T/T)（线性增长步长）和多项式平均的O(T^{-(1−α)})。数值实验验证了这些速率。

Conclusion: 该工作将SF的无时间步长保证扩展到非凸优化，并为未来研究最优非凸收敛率提供了方向。

Abstract: First-order methods underpin most large-scale learning algorithms, yet their
classical convergence guarantees hinge on carefully scheduled step-sizes that
depend on the total horizon $T$, which is rarely known in advance. The
Schedule-Free (SF) method promises optimal performance with hyperparameters
that are independent of $T$ by interpolating between Polyak--Ruppert averaging
and momentum, but nonconvex analysis of SF has been limited or reliant on
strong global assumptions. We introduce a robust Lyapunov framework that, under
only $L$-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reduces SF analysis to a single-step
descent inequality. This yields horizon-agnostic bounds in the nonconvex
setting: $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for a
linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for
polynomial averaging. We complement these proofs with Performance Estimation
Problem (PEP) experiments that numerically validate our rates and suggest that
our $O(1/\log T)$ bound on the original nonconvex SF algorithm may tighten to
$O(1/T)$. Our work extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex
optimization and charts future directions for optimal nonconvex rates.

Abstract: Collaboratively fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) over
heterogeneous mobile devices fosters immense potential applications of
personalized intelligence. However, such a vision faces critical system
challenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive
computational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous
model aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose
Fed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across
mobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model
architectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering
server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform
lightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen
pre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations.
The server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side
backpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model
heterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise
feature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for
collaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while
achieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in
computation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster
convergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical
LLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.

Result: 证明了监控层激活的左右零空间及其 Fisher 几何可以提供关于表示变化的具体、可测试的保证。

Conclusion: ZDP 框架为模型漂移检测提供了理论支持，并展示了零空间监控的实用性。

Abstract: We present Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP), a theory-only framework for
detecting model drift from null directions of transformer activations without
task labels or output evaluations. Under assumptions A1--A6, we prove: (i) the
Variance--Leak Theorem, (ii) Fisher Null-Conservation, (iii) a Rank--Leak bound
for low-rank updates, and (iv) a logarithmic-regret guarantee for online
null-space trackers. We derive a Spectral Null-Leakage (SNL) metric with
non-asymptotic tail bounds and a concentration inequality, yielding a-priori
thresholds for drift under a Gaussian null model. These results show that
monitoring right/left null spaces of layer activations and their Fisher
geometry provides concrete, testable guarantees on representational change.

TL;DR: PROPS框架通过多阶段隐私保护对齐方法，在保持高隐私的同时提升LLM对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 依赖人类反馈的LLM对齐可能泄露标注者的个人偏好，现有方法（如DP-SGD）隐私保护过度且影响模型性能。

Method: 提出PROPS框架，通过多阶段对齐，利用前一阶段的私有模型为后续阶段提供标注数据。

Result: 在相同隐私预算下，PROPS的胜率比DP-SGD高3倍，比基于随机响应的方法高2.5倍。

Conclusion: PROPS在隐私保护和模型性能之间取得了更好平衡，适用于LLM对齐任务。

Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using
human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms.
Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's
preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality
traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD),
provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning
and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences
are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model
utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy,
which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose
PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving
alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve
as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of
alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive
validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval,
Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over
existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy
budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to
DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based
alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MA-NTAE的新型自监督学习方法，用于解决高维张量数据的非线性关系学习问题，相比传统方法在计算复杂度和性能上具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量数据在自监督学习中面临维度灾难和计算负担问题，现有方法难以有效捕捉非线性关系。

Method: MA-NTAE通过非线性Tucker分解框架和Pick-and-Unfold策略，实现高维张量的灵活编码，计算复杂度与张量阶数线性相关。

Result: 实验表明，MA-NTAE在压缩和聚类任务中优于传统自编码器和现有张量网络，尤其在高阶高维张量上表现更优。

Conclusion: MA-NTAE为高维张量数据的非线性特征学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data, particularly in the form of high-order tensors,
presents a major challenge in self-supervised learning. While MLP-based
autoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening
operations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively
large model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization
for deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks
alleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most
exhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder
(MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear
framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible
per-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold
operations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE
exhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and
proportional growth with mode dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MA-NTAE's performance advantages over standard AE and current tensor networks
in compression and clustering tasks, which become increasingly pronounced for
higher-order, higher-dimensional tensors.

Motivation: 传统方法通过重建缺失模态处理多模态情感识别问题，但未考虑样本间重建难度的差异，限制了模型对困难样本的处理效果。

Method: HARDY-MER框架分两阶段：1) 通过多视角硬度评估机制量化样本重建难度；2) 采用基于检索的动态课程学习策略动态调整训练重点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，HARDY-MER在缺失模态场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HARDY-MER通过动态课程学习有效提升了模型对困难样本的处理能力，为多模态情感识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in
multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address
this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail
to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different
samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples
effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware
Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates
in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and
second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance
model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first
introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies
reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality
reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information).
Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with
similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and
hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.

Motivation: 现有方法通过离线数据集生成与在线数据分布一致的数据进行增强，但生成数据与在线数据仍存在差距，限制了性能。

Method: 提出Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG)，利用无分类器引导扩散技术提升生成质量，并采用重加权方法使生成数据更贴合在线数据分布。

Result: CFDG在D4RL基准测试（如MuJoCo和AntMaze）上实现了15%的平均性能提升。

Conclusion: CFDG是一种通用方法，可与现有O2O RL算法结合，显著提升性能且保持稳定性。

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online
fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online
interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform
to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data
still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To
address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free
Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training
overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly
enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different
distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more
generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while
maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG
outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to
generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing
offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL,
PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical
performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在小众或私有领域（如Q语言）任务表现不佳的问题。

Method: 引入新的Q语言评估数据集，基于Qwen-2.5系列训练不同规模的模型，包括预训练、监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 最佳模型在Q语言任务上的准确率达到59%，优于主流前沿模型。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至其他小众任务，并提供了详细的实现蓝图。

Abstract: Even though large language models are becoming increasingly capable, it is
still unreasonable to expect them to excel at tasks that are under-represented
on the Internet. Leveraging LLMs for specialized applications, particularly in
niche programming languages and private domains, remains challenging and
largely unsolved. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a
comprehensive, open-source approach for adapting LLMs to the Q programming
language, a popular tool in quantitative finance that is much less present on
the Internet compared to Python, C, Java, and other ``mainstream" languages and
is therefore not a strong suit of general-purpose AI models. We introduce a new
Leetcode style evaluation dataset for Q, benchmark major frontier models on the
dataset, then do pretraining, supervised fine tuning, and reinforcement
learning to train a suite of reasoning and non-reasoning models based on the
Qwen-2.5 series, spanning five parameter sizes (1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B). Our
best model achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 59 percent on our Q benchmark,
surpassing the best-performing frontier model, Claude Opus-4 by 29.5 percent.
Additionally, all models, even our 1.5B model, outperform GPT-4.1 on this task.
In addition to releasing models, code, and data, we provide a detailed
blueprint for dataset construction, model pretraining, supervised fine-tuning,
and reinforcement learning. Our methodology is broadly applicable, and we
discuss how these techniques can be extended to other tasks, including those
where evaluation may rely on soft or subjective signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对隐藏行为的先验知识有限且可能存在对抗性混淆，检测神经网络中的隐藏行为具有挑战性。

Method: 通过红队（训练两个模型）和蓝队（尝试识别有害模型）的对抗游戏框架，实验使用了CNN和多种蓝队策略（如高斯噪声分析、模型差异分析等）。

Result: 基于对抗攻击的方法在提供提示时准确率达100%，其他方法表现不一。LLM审计需要关于不良分布的提示。

Conclusion: 开源了审计游戏框架，研究结果有助于设计更好的审计方法。

Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge
due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We
explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two
teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign
data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the
performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The
blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to
identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue
team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated
gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by
the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods
(100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the
other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds,
we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our
study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require
some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard
black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their
misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and
hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

Motivation: 塑性损失是深度强化学习中的关键挑战，尤其在多任务学习中，更高的表示灵活性对处理多样化任务需求至关重要。

Method: 通过系统评估稀疏化方法（GMP和SET）在不同MTRL架构（共享主干、专家混合、正交专家混合）中的表现，并与密集基线及其他塑性诱导或正则化方法对比。

Result: GMP和SET有效缓解了塑性退化指标（如神经元休眠和表示崩溃），稀疏代理在多任务性能上常优于密集代理，并与显式塑性干预方法竞争。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏化是提升MTRL系统适应性的有效工具，但其效果受上下文影响。

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a
critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in
multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational
flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task
demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly
Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance
plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate
these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture
of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks,
comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative
plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that
both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation,
such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity
improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse
agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive
results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights
into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs,
highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for
developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Abstract: Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms developed in the 1990's
by Gammerman, Vovk, and their research team, to provide set predictions with
guaranteed confidence level. Over recent years, they have grown in popularity
and have become a mainstream methodology for uncertainty quantification in the
machine learning community. From its beginning, there was an understanding that
they enable reliable machine learning with well-calibrated uncertainty
quantification. This makes them extremely beneficial for developing trustworthy
AI, a topic that has also risen in interest over the past few years, in both
the AI community and society more widely. In this article, we review the
potential for conformal prediction to contribute to trustworthy AI beyond its
marginal validity property, addressing problems such as generalization risk and
AI governance. Experiments and examples are also provided to demonstrate its
use as a well-calibrated predictor and for bias identification and mitigation.

Motivation: 传统模型在数据稀缺场景（如领域迁移或极端条件下的预测）中难以应对零样本时间序列预测（ZSF），而现有的时间序列预训练模型（TSPMs）缺乏动态整合外部知识的机制。

Method: 论文提出了QuiZSF框架，包括：1）构建层次化树结构的ChronoRAG Base（CRB）用于可扩展的时间序列存储和领域感知检索；2）引入多粒度序列交互学习器（MSIL）提取细粒度和粗粒度关系特征；3）开发双分支模型协作器（MCC）以对齐检索到的知识与两种TSPMs（非LLM和LLM基础）。

Conclusion: 通过结合RAG和TSPMs，QuiZSF显著提升了零样本时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has become increasingly important to empower diverse
applications with streaming data. Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF),
particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or
forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to
deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated
strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically
incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on
demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of
both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series
forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series
Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient
retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF.
Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB)
for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a
Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and
coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation
Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM
based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM
based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and
87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and
inference time.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified
class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that
are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased
performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a
class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and
class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise
inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from
positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise
group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training
objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness
of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world
datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively
impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both
class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's
generalization ability.

Conclusion: AMFT通过元学习控制器实现了更稳定、高效的训练，为LLM对齐提供了更优的范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks
through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by
Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and
suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage
methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled
mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we
reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit
rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary
reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel
single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,
path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is
a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL
balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize
long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by
policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training
curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks
spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),
and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new
state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution
(OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the
meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency,
and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM
alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

TL;DR: BoRA是一种改进的低秩适应方法，通过块矩阵乘法和块间对角矩阵提升LoRA的秩，同时仅需少量额外参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在大型语言模型中的低秩适应方法通过增加秩提升性能，但参数数量显著增加。BoRA旨在以更少的额外参数实现更高的秩。

Method: BoRA将LoRA的矩阵乘积分解为块矩阵乘法，并为每个块引入独特的对角矩阵，从而提升秩。

Result: 实验表明BoRA在多个数据集和模型上表现优越，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: BoRA通过块多样化和对角矩阵设计，高效提升了LoRA的性能和参数效率。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). It approximates the update of a
pretrained weight matrix $W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ by the product of two
low-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \in\mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ and
$B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r} (r\ll\min\{m,n\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$
can raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves
fine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of
trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank
Adaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number
of additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block
matrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along
the columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\dots,A_b]$ and
$B=[B_1,\dots,B_b]^\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the
concatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\in[b]$. To enhance the
diversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix
$\Sigma_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$ for each block multiplication,
resulting in $B_i \Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal
matrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only
requiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies
further validate its scalability.

Abstract: Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The
usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model
performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense
of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be
leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior.
In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as
additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of
this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which
remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides
numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do
not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model
performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in
some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can
be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate
the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation,
classification, and regression tasks. Code available at

Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on
structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent
variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a
reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the
framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical
well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of
data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports
real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of
digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor
data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a
non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration
of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics,
and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate
predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations),
including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time
inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES. An open-source
implementation is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Discovery Learning（DL）的科学机器学习范式，通过结合主动学习、物理引导学习和零样本学习，显著减少了电池设计验证的时间和能源成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池设计和验证的高成本和时间消耗是技术创新的瓶颈，现有数据驱动方法需要目标设计的标记数据，无法在原型设计前提供可靠预测。

Method: DL整合了主动学习、物理引导学习和零样本学习，利用历史电池设计数据，无需额外标记数据即可预测未观察到的材料设计组合的寿命。

Result: 在123个工业级锂离子电池上测试，DL仅使用公开的小容量圆柱电池数据集，实现了7.2%的测试误差，节省了98%的时间和95%的能源。

Conclusion: DL展示了从历史设计中提取信息以加速下一代电池技术开发的潜力，是数据驱动建模的重要进展。

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery
and engineering innovation.

Method: 提出轨迹-位置双塔架构，包括通用空间编码的位置塔和序列移动建模的轨迹塔，并设计MoE Transformer块自适应处理多样移动模式。

Result: 在多城市数据集上实验表明，UniMove通过联合训练和相互数据增强，预测准确性提升超过10.2%。

Conclusion: UniMove是实现人类移动统一基础模型的关键进展，支持多城市数据联合训练。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation
optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness,
non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded
by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and
population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing
solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct
spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose
UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing
two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for
effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility
patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location
dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding
and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE
Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement
patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities
demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By
enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it
significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove
represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a
unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniMove/.

TL;DR: 本文研究了特征选择（FS）在Tsetlin机器（TM）中的应用，评估了多种FS方法，包括经典过滤和嵌入式方法，以及后解释方法（如SHAP和LIME），并提出了一种新的基于TM子句权重和Tsetlin自动机状态的嵌入式评分器。实验结果表明，TM内部评分器不仅表现优异，还能利用子句的可解释性揭示特征交互模式。


<details>

Motivation: TM虽然提供可解释的子句学习，但缺乏特征重要性评估工具。本文旨在填补这一空白，为TM开发特征选择方法。

Method: 评估了多种FS技术，包括经典方法、后解释方法（SHAP、LIME）和新型TM嵌入式评分器。使用了ROAR和ROAD等评估协议。

Result: TM内部评分器表现优异，能揭示特征交互模式；TM专用评分器在计算成本更低的情况下实现了相似的准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究为TM中的FS建立了首个全面基线，并为开发专用可解释性技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Feature Selection (FS) is crucial for improving model interpretability,
reducing complexity, and sometimes for enhancing accuracy. The recently
introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) offers interpretable clause-based learning, but
lacks established tools for estimating feature importance. In this paper, we
adapt and evaluate a range of FS techniques for TMs, including classical filter
and embedded methods as well as post-hoc explanation methods originally
developed for neural networks (e.g., SHAP and LIME) and a novel family of
embedded scorers derived from TM clause weights and Tsetlin automaton (TA)
states. We benchmark all methods across 12 datasets, using evaluation
protocols, like Remove and Retrain (ROAR) strategy and Remove and Debias
(ROAD), to assess causal impact. Our results show that TM-internal scorers not
only perform competitively but also exploit the interpretability of clauses to
reveal interacting feature patterns. Simpler TM-specific scorers achieve
similar accuracy retention at a fraction of the computational cost. This study
establishes the first comprehensive baseline for FS in TM and paves the way for
developing specialized TM-specific interpretability techniques.

Result: 模拟研究表明，贪心算法能选择接近最优的专家子集，显著提升多专家协作的分类性能。

Conclusion: 在多专家场景下，实例相关的专家子集选择是提升分类性能的关键，贪心算法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in
classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a
pre-trained model. This human-AI collaboration has demonstrated enhanced
classification performance compared to using either the model or the expert
independently. In this study, we focus on the selection of instance-specific
experts from a pool of multiple human experts, contrasting it with existing
research that typically focuses on single-expert scenarios. We characterize the
conditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets.
With the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance,
we explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm
that utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that
will be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better
performance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real
expert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation
study indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal
subsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple
experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型常忽略时间滞后互相关关系，而这些关系对捕捉复杂时间依赖性至关重要。

Method: 采用序列移位动态时间规整（SSDTW）算法捕捉滞后相关性，并结合对比学习编码器高效近似SSDTW距离。

Result: 在天气、金融和房地产数据集上，SSDTW和对比学习编码器分别显著降低MSE，且对比学习将SSDTW计算时间减少约99%。

Conclusion: TLCCSP框架通过整合时间滞后互相关和对比学习，显著提升了预测精度和计算效率，适用于多领域时间序列预测。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across various domains, such as weather,
finance and real estate forecasting, as accurate forecasts support informed
decision-making and risk mitigation. While recent deep learning models have
improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged
cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing
complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged
Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances
forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated
sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW)
algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based
encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances.
  Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW
reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence
methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by
17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE
reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by
21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach
decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability
and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行为克隆（BC）方法在自动驾驶中因闭环执行中的累积错误而表现脆弱的问题。

Method: 开发了一系列BC基线模型，最终采用基于Transformer的模型，并应用离线强化学习算法CQL，结合精心设计的奖励函数。

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset的1000个未见场景中，CQL方法的成功率比最强BC基线高3.2倍，碰撞率低7.4倍。

Conclusion: 离线强化学习方法对于从静态专家数据中学习稳健的长时程驾驶策略至关重要。

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a
central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often
unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward
approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously
brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work
presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this
limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC
baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a
structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low
imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We
then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement
Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and
architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a
carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value
function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid
out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen
scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a
3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC
baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust,
long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

Motivation: 解决传统模型在建模神经退行性疾病进展时的局限性，包括纵向数据稀缺和病理机制复杂性的问题。

Method: 采用阶段感知的混合专家框架（MoE）和时间依赖的专家权重，结合不均匀图神经扩散模型（IGND）和局部神经反应模块。

Conclusion: IGND-MoE为理解神经退行性疾病的阶段特异性机制提供了新方法，具有临床意义。

Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly
conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph
diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized
reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression
remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained
through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of
pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where
traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms
dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert
weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to
properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,
constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.
Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural
diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and
time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also
introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond
standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these
components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how
stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The
stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,
suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,
while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.

Motivation: 现实环境中，环境因素（如风力变化或电磁干扰）可能导致未观测到的噪声统计漂移，导致基于学习的方法性能下降。

Method: OTAKNet通过一步预测测量似然建立状态估计与漂移之间的联系，并利用最优传输的几何感知成本和稳定梯度实现在线适应。

Result: 在合成和真实NCLT数据集上验证了OTAKNet的性能，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: OTAKNet是首个解决噪声统计漂移的在线学习解决方案，优于传统模型和离线学习方法。

Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear
dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown.
However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing
wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved
noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based
methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online
solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman
filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline
fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet
establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step
predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.
This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully
online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet
against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline
learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and
real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.

Motivation: 减轻大型语言模型的高计算需求，但发现知识蒸馏可能导致学生模型继承教师模型的隐私风险。

Method: 通过指令调优设置，涵盖七种NLP任务、三种教师模型家族（GPT-2、LLAMA-2、OPT）及不同规模的学生模型，分析六种KD技术的隐私风险。

Result: 所有KD技术均存在隐私风险，但程度不同；记忆与成员隐私风险之间存在显著不一致；不同模块的隐私风险差异较大。

Conclusion: KD技术需谨慎选择以平衡效率与隐私保护，未来研究应关注隐私风险的具体影响因素。

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Distillation (KD) aim to mitigate the high
computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring knowledge
from a large ''teacher'' to a smaller ''student'' model. However, students may
inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In
this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and
memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using
instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three
teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student
models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and
memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the
extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We
systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions,
student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also
demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership
privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy
risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a
large margin.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种“先遗忘后学习”的策略，通过参数高效微调技术（$IA^3$）解决大语言模型（LLMs）动态知识更新的问题，显著提高了新知识的准确性和旧知识的遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在动态更新知识时，尤其是新旧知识冲突时，存在难以接受新知识和严重遗忘无关知识的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：首先定位冲突知识编码的内部组件，然后通过“先遗忘后学习”结合$IA^3$技术进行知识编辑。

Result: 实验显示，新知识准确率达98.50%，旧知识遗忘率达96.00%，显著优于直接微调方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了精确、局部化且安全的知识管理，为大语言模型的知识更新提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates,
especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such
conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to
adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated
knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn"
strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting
and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach
is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets
the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.
Through a rigorous experimental methodology on
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically
informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the
new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original
conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits
unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating
catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed
as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted
interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals
a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is
suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally
accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a
significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge
management in compact LLMs.

Conclusion: 开发了一个鲁棒的框架，可可靠地监控概念漂移，适用于实际机器学习应用。

Abstract: In applied machine learning, concept drift, which is either gradual or abrupt
changes in data distribution, can significantly reduce model performance.
Typical detection methods,such as statistical tests or reconstruction-based
models,are generally reactive and not very sensitive to early detection. Our
study proposes a hybrid framework consisting of Transformers and Autoencoders
to model complex temporal dynamics and provide online drift detection. We
create a distinct Trust Score methodology, which includes signals on (1)
statistical and reconstruction-based drift metrics, more specifically, PSI,
JSD, Transformer-AE error, (2) prediction uncertainty, (3) rules violations,
and (4) trend of classifier error aligned with the combined metrics defined by
the Trust Score. Using a time sequenced airline passenger data set with
synthetic drift, our proposed model allows for a better detection of drift
using as a whole and at different detection thresholds for both sensitivity and
interpretability compared to baseline methods and provides a strong pipeline
for drift detection in real time for applied machine learning. We evaluated
performance using a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset having the
gradually injected stimulus of drift in expectations,e.g. permuted ticket
prices in later batches, broken into 10 time segments [1].In the data, our
results support that the Transformation-Autoencoder detected drift earlier and
with more sensitivity than the autoencoders commonly used in the literature,
and provided improved modeling over more error rates and logical violations.
Therefore, a robust framework was developed to reliably monitor concept drift.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free
paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework,
which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable
efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study
on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average
acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the
feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies
a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby
supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then
characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that
under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be
implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class.
Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by
leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention
operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to
within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results
lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine
rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: BrainATCL为动态脑功能连接建模提供了一种有效方法，能够捕捉生物意义拓扑模式，并在实际任务中验证了其性能。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique widely
used to study human brain activity. fMRI signals in areas across the brain
transiently synchronise and desynchronise their activity in a highly structured
manner, even when an individual is at rest. These functional connectivity
dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model
these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as
they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight
into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However,
conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range
temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we
propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive
temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and
age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each
snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are
subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal
representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data
of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve
spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge
attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership
of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful
topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link
prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior
performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction
scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain
more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses
testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more
discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for
state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This
method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in
their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their
single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing
the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to
the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete
application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle
collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain
circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher
Information latent in a dataset.

TL;DR: LOGIC是一个轻量级框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）为GNN预测生成忠实且可解释的解释，通过将GNN节点嵌入投影到LLM嵌入空间，并结合混合提示，实现了高保真度和稀疏性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法难以生成细粒度、可解释的推理，尤其是在节点属性包含丰富自然语言时。LOGIC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: LOGIC将GNN节点嵌入投影到LLM嵌入空间，构建混合提示（软提示与文本输入交替），使LLM能推理GNN内部表示并生成自然语言解释和子图。

Result: 在四个真实TAG数据集上的实验表明，LOGIC在保真度和稀疏性之间取得平衡，并显著提升了人类中心指标（如启发性）。

Conclusion: LOGIC为基于LLM的图学习可解释性开辟了新方向，通过将GNN内部表示与人类推理对齐。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over
structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains
such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not
inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed.
However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable,
fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural
language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable
explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the
LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts
with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason
about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations
along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four
real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off
between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric
metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based
explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多级服务调用结构的分布式后端系统性能波动预测的挑战。

Method: 将系统状态抽象为图结构序列，结合运行时特征和服务调用关系，构建时空建模框架，使用图卷积网络和高门控循环网络提取依赖信息和动态演化。

Result: 实验表明，模型在MAE、RMSE和R2等关键指标上优于现有方法，且在不同负载和结构复杂度下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该模型在后台服务性能管理任务中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network-based performance
prediction algorithm to address the challenge of forecasting performance
fluctuations in distributed backend systems with multi-level service call
structures. The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a
sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service
nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified
spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph
convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the
service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic
evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also
introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal
sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the
multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future
service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of
multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time
windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate
the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show
that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key
metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying
load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the
model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线强化学习中，标量反馈通常存在噪声和不一致问题，限制了奖励模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: Pref-GUIDE通过短窗口内比较行为并过滤模糊反馈（Individual）或聚合多用户奖励模型形成共识偏好（Voting），将标量反馈转化为偏好数据。

Result: 在三个挑战性环境中，Pref-GUIDE显著优于标量反馈基线，Voting版本甚至超过专家设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: Pref-GUIDE通过将标量反馈重构为结构化偏好和群体反馈，为在线强化学习中利用人类输入提供了可扩展且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when
task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While
prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human
preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents
must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time
scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued
learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is
often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of
learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time
scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for
continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal
inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering
ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by
aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus
preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly
outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even
expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured
preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and
principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement
learning.

Conclusion: LLMs在心血管疾病早期检测和个性化医疗中具有重要应用前景。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to
its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality.
Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data,
extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy,
and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has
been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological
sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict
cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers
derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of
genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can
learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured
genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the
family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task,
the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed
clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The
findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk
assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac
care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半NMF算法多为迭代和非凸，易陷入局部最优，需要一种全局最优的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于输入数据散布矩阵的正交分解方法，确保在Frobenius范数下达到全局最优解。

Result: 实验证明该方法在重构误差上优于现有NMF和半NMF方法，且在低秩情况下恢复NMF结构。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了全局最优的理论保证和实际优势，为矩阵分解优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (semi-NMF) extends classical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by allowing the basis matrix to contain
both positive and negative entries, making it suitable for decomposing data
with mixed signs. However, most existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative,
non-convex, and prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method
that yields a globally optimal solution to the semi-NMF problem under the
Frobenius norm, through an orthogonal decomposition derived from the scatter
matrix of the input data. We rigorously prove that our solution attains the
global minimum of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
when the input matrix is nonnegative, our method often achieves lower
reconstruction error than standard NMF algorithms, although unfortunately the
basis matrix may not satisfy nonnegativity. In particular, in low-rank cases
such as rank 1 or 2, our solution reduces exactly to a nonnegative
factorization, recovering the NMF structure. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Wine dataset, showing that our
method consistently outperforms existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. These results confirm that our globally optimal,
non-iterative formulation offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical
advantages, providing a new perspective on matrix factorization in optimization
and data analysis.

Motivation: DPO损失函数在理论上与其推导不一致，可能导致训练不稳定和奖励黑客行为，因此需要一种更稳定的替代方案。

Method: 从RLHF最优条件直接推导出一种新的损失函数，针对有限的logits差异值，而非最大化。

Result: 新方法在Qwen2.5-7B模型上微调，显著优于标准DPO基线，并与更大的模型（如Llama-3.1-8B）竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数在理论和实践中均表现出更好的稳定性和对齐效果。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is
commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a
direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating
the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss
function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes
the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training
instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function
derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets
a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the
underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical
analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method
avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred
responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and
leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a
Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO
baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like
Llama-3.1-8B.

Result: 实验验证了不同参数对博弈结果的影响，展示了激励机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 代币激励机制能够有效平衡隐私保护和模型准确性，为联邦学习提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients jointly train a machine learning
model by sharing gradient information, instead of raw data, with a server over
multiple rounds. To address the possibility of information leakage in spite of
sharing only the gradients, Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is often used. In
LDP, clients add a selective amount of noise to the gradients before sending
the same to the server. Although such noise addition protects the privacy of
clients, it leads to a degradation in global model accuracy. In this paper, we
model this privacy-accuracy trade-off as a game, where the sever incentivizes
the clients to add a lower degree of noise for achieving higher accuracy, while
the clients attempt to preserve their privacy at the cost of a potential loss
in accuracy. A token based incentivization mechanism is introduced in which the
quantum of tokens credited to a client in an FL round is a function of the
degree of perturbation of its gradients. The client can later access a newly
updated global model only after acquiring enough tokens, which are to be
deducted from its balance. We identify the players, their actions and payoff,
and perform a strategic analysis of the game. Extensive experiments were
carried out to study the impact of different parameters.

Motivation: 低精度训练虽能降低计算和内存成本，但梯度量化的收缩和噪声可能改变SGD的收敛行为，需研究其影响。

Method: 通过梯度收缩模型分析SGD收敛，假设梯度被缩放因子$q_k$缩放并受零均值量化噪声扰动。

Result: 低精度SGD仍收敛，但速度受$q_{\min}$限制，且量化噪声增加了渐近误差。

Conclusion: 低精度训练通过梯度收缩和量化噪声影响收敛速度和精度，需权衡计算成本与性能。

Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational
and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of
gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can
alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this
work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where
each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by
zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to
replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$,
which slows convergence when $q_{\min} < 1$. Under standard smoothness and
bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges,
but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased
asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how
reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient
shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.

Motivation: 研究Transformer的深度（层数）与其在上下文学习（ICL）中表现的关系，特别是双层单头Transformer是否能表示高阶马尔可夫过程。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明双层单头Transformer可以表示任何条件k-gram模型，并进一步分析其学习动态。

Result: 双层单头Transformer能够表示任何k阶马尔可夫过程，且在学习过程中能有效形成上下文表示。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了浅层Transformer在结构化序列建模任务中具有强大的ICL能力，深化了对Transformer ICL机制的理解。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through
which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from
the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to
the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence
between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling
sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of
model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can
efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart
cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher
order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three
layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a
two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In
this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer
transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional
k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the
interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,
we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,
focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating
how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together,
these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and
illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL
capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如高斯过程(GPs)在处理大数据时存在可扩展性问题，而神经过程(NPs)难以捕捉多模态目标分布。神经扩散过程(NDPs)虽提升了表达能力，但存在输入耦合弱和终点语义不匹配的问题。

Method: 通过重新设计前向核，使其显式依赖于输入x，NBP强制约束路径严格终止于监督目标，从而增强梯度信号并保证终点一致性。

Result: 在合成数据、EEG信号回归和图像回归任务中，NBP显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NBP通过DDPM风格的桥采样，提升了结构化预测任务的性能和理论一致性。

Abstract: Learning stochastic functions from partially observed context-target pairs is
a fundamental problem in probabilistic modeling. Traditional models like
Gaussian Processes (GPs) face scalability issues with large datasets and assume
Gaussianity, limiting their applicability. While Neural Processes (NPs) offer
more flexibility, they struggle with capturing complex, multi-modal target
distributions. Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs) enhance expressivity through a
learned diffusion process but rely solely on conditional signals in the
denoising network, resulting in weak input coupling from an unconditional
forward process and semantic mismatch at the diffusion endpoint. In this work,
we propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling
stochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire
diffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend
on x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the
supervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals
but also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG
signal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial
improvements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of
DDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical
consistency for structured prediction tasks.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents
a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias.
Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly
robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment
effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world
environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in
unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder
identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and
scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based
agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate
agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework
systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure
discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which
reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on
real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment
effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering
unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents
offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware
causal inference.

Abstract: We present EDGE, a general-purpose, misconception-aware adaptive learning
framework composed of four stages: Evaluate (ability and state estimation),
Diagnose (posterior infer-ence of misconceptions), Generate (counterfactual
item synthesis), and Exercise (index-based retrieval scheduling). EDGE unifies
psychometrics (IRT/Bayesian state space models), cog-nitive diagnostics
(misconception discovery from distractor patterns and response latencies),
contrastive item generation (minimal perturbations that invalidate learner
shortcuts while pre-serving psychometric validity), and principled scheduling
(a restless bandit approximation to spaced retrieval). We formalize a composite
readiness metric, EdgeScore, prove its monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity,
and derive an index policy that is near-optimal under mild assumptions on
forgetting and learning gains. We further establish conditions under which
counterfactual items provably reduce the posterior probability of a targeted
misconception faster than standard practice. The paper focuses on theory and
implementable pseudocode; empirical study is left to future work.

Result: 在四种分布偏移场景下，CNSDiff平均性能提升13.96%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CNSDiff能有效减少虚假硬负样本，提升推荐系统在分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting
negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to
guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our
empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental
confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause
heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These
misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations
induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability
under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method
named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing
negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,
CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus
reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal
regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental
confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives
that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive
experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate
that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and
robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: 本文首次实现了风险敏感目标的二阶稳定点收敛，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: We consider the problem of risk-sensitive control in a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. In particular, we aim to find a risk-optimal policy by
maximizing the distortion riskmetric (DRM) of the discounted reward in a finite
horizon Markov decision process (MDP). DRMs are a rich class of risk measures
that include several well-known risk measures as special cases. We derive a
policy Hessian theorem for the DRM objective using the likelihood ratio method.
Using this result, we propose a natural DRM Hessian estimator from sample
trajectories of the underlying MDP. Next, we present a cubic-regularized policy
Newton algorithm for solving this problem in an on-policy RL setting using
estimates of the DRM gradient and Hessian. Our proposed algorithm is shown to
converge to an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of
the DRM objective, and this guarantee ensures the escaping of saddle points.
The sample complexity of our algorithms to find an $ \epsilon$-SOSP is
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$. Our experiments validate the theoretical
findings. To the best of our knowledge, our is the first work to present
convergence to an $\epsilon$-SOSP of a risk-sensitive objective, while existing
works in the literature have either shown convergence to a first-order
stationary point of a risk-sensitive objective, or a SOSP of a risk-neutral
one.

Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy,
yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG
interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches
often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world
applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative,
open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable
seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on
two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and
electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an
automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting
mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG
before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within
each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve
high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and
0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets
despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models
trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case)
without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the
within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset
results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the
potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in
diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we
provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure
detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption,
complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating
clinical integration.

Conclusion: 论文总结了当前挑战，并指出了影响函数在大规模深度学习场景中的未来发展方向。

Abstract: The goal of data attribution is to trace the model's predictions through the
learning algorithm and back to its training data. thereby identifying the most
influential training samples and understanding how the model's behavior leads
to particular predictions. Understanding how individual training examples
influence a model's predictions is fundamental for machine learning
interpretability, data debugging, and model accountability. Influence
functions, originating from robust statistics, offer an efficient, first-order
approximation to estimate the impact of marginally upweighting or removing a
data point on a model's learned parameters and its subsequent predictions,
without the need for expensive retraining. This paper comprehensively reviews
the data attribution capability of influence functions in deep learning. We
discuss their theoretical foundations, recent algorithmic advances for
efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation, and evaluate their
effectiveness for data attribution and mislabel detection. Finally,
highlighting current challenges and promising directions for unleashing the
huge potential of influence functions in large-scale, real-world deep learning
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督任务的选择依赖启发式方法，缺乏理论依据，难以提前评估任务合理性。论文旨在通过理论统一和方法改进解决这一问题。

Method: 基于知识可学习性、可靠性和完整性三个因素，提出理论分析框架，并设计预测无监督任务有效性的方法。

Result: 实验验证了预测性能与实际性能的高度相关性，证实了理论和评估方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文为无监督任务选择提供了理论依据和实用工具，改变了依赖启发式方法的现状。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models
by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning
(SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext
tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We
extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of
unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical
frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance
hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model,
knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with
respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these
theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the
effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status
quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are
heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the
rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on
the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the
predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance
achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus
confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation
method.

Abstract: With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on
resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture
of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse
activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The
presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe
degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,
significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,
efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to
balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an
efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)
and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian
matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and
weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers
while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we
design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,
combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment
and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory
footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series
and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of
the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while
GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is
significantly improved.

Abstract: Stochastic interpolants offer a robust framework for continuously
transforming samples between arbitrary data distributions, holding significant
promise for generative modeling. Despite their potential, rigorous finite-time
convergence guarantees for practical numerical schemes remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we address the finite-time convergence analysis of
numerical implementations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived
from stochastic interpolants. Specifically, we establish novel finite-time
error bounds in total variation distance for two widely used numerical
integrators: the first-order forward Euler method and the second-order Heun's
method. Furthermore, our analysis on the iteration complexity of specific
stochastic interpolant constructions provides optimized schedules to enhance
computational efficiency. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by
numerical experiments, which validate the derived error bounds and complexity
analyses.

Abstract: \textbf{Introduction:} Accurate prediction of Phage Virion Proteins (PVP) is
essential for genomic studies due to their crucial role as structural elements
in bacteriophages. Computational tools, particularly machine learning, have
emerged for annotating phage protein sequences from high-throughput sequencing.
However, effective annotation requires specialized sequence encodings. Our
paper introduces ProteoKnight, a new image-based encoding method that addresses
spatial constraints in existing techniques, yielding competitive performance in
PVP classification using pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
Additionally, our study evaluates prediction uncertainty in binary PVP
classification through Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). \textbf{Methods:}
ProteoKnight adapts the classical DNA-Walk algorithm for protein sequences,
incorporating pixel colors and adjusting walk distances to capture intricate
protein features. Encoded sequences were classified using multiple pre-trained
CNNs. Variance and entropy measures assessed prediction uncertainty across
proteins of various classes and lengths. \textbf{Results:} Our experiments
achieved 90.8% accuracy in binary classification, comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. Multi-class classification accuracy remains
suboptimal. Our uncertainty analysis unveils variability in prediction
confidence influenced by protein class and sequence length.
\textbf{Conclusions:} Our study surpasses frequency chaos game representation
(FCGR) by introducing novel image encoding that mitigates spatial information
loss limitations. Our classification technique yields accurate and robust PVP
predictions while identifying low-confidence predictions.

Result: 证明了ReLU网络和线性网络中梯度流可简化为低维动态，并推广了平衡初始化的概念。

Conclusion: 内在动态特性为理解深度学习中的梯度流提供了新视角，并在特定初始化条件下实现了维度简化。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the theory of deep learning is to understand
whether gradient-based training in high-dimensional parameter spaces can be
captured by simpler, lower-dimensional structures, leading to so-called
implicit bias. As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a
high-dimensional variable $\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a
lower-dimensional variable $z = \phi(\theta)$, for an architecture-related
function $\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how
it is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the
factorization $\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion
of kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property
to hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth
and show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an
intrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the
initialization, when $\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of
linear networks with $\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced
initializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we
generalize this result to a broader class of {\em relaxed balanced}
initializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the
\emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property.
Finally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep
linear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express
the corresponding intrinsic dynamics.

Abstract: Modern methods of generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image
translation based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control
theory aim to transform an initial density to a target one in an optimal way.
In the present paper, we assume that we only have access to i.i.d. samples from
initial and final distributions. This makes our setup suitable for both
generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image translation. Relying on the
stochastic optimal control approach, we choose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as
the reference one and estimate the corresponding Schr\"odinger potential.
Introducing a risk function as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
couplings, we derive tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical
risk minimizer in a class of Schr\"odinger potentials including Gaussian
mixtures. Thanks to the mixing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we
almost achieve fast rates of convergence up to some logarithmic factors in
favourable scenarios. We also illustrate performance of the suggested approach
with numerical experiments.

Motivation: 现有LRNN模型因时间不变转移矩阵或受限特征值范围而缺乏状态追踪能力，需探索输入依赖转移矩阵的作用。

Method: 研究多层SSM中结合输入独立和非负转移矩阵的效果，特别针对对角转移矩阵的SSM。

Result: 实验表明，此类组合仍无法解决奇偶校验任务，说明有效递归层需输入依赖和负特征值。

Conclusion: 输入依赖和负特征值是SSM模型实现状态追踪任务的关键要素。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that LRNN models such as S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet lack
state-tracking capability due to either time-invariant transition matrices or
restricted eigenvalue ranges. To address this, input-dependent transition
matrices, particularly those that are complex or non-triangular, have been
proposed to enhance SSM performance on such tasks. While existing theorems
demonstrate that both input-independent and non-negative SSMs are incapable of
solving simple state-tracking tasks, such as parity, regardless of depth, they
do not explore whether combining these two types in a multilayer SSM could
help. We investigate this question for efficient SSMs with diagonal transition
matrices and show that such combinations still fail to solve parity. This
implies that a recurrence layer must both be input-dependent and include
negative eigenvalues. Our experiments support this conclusion by analyzing an
SSM model that combines S4D and Mamba layers.

Motivation: 奖励函数的恢复问题在缺乏额外假设时是高度不适定的，但在实际应用中奖励通常是稀疏的，且有先验信息可用。

Method: 1) 假设奖励大多为常数且变化不频繁，转化为稀疏化问题；2) 假设奖励可由少量特征函数线性组合表示，转化为秩最小化问题。针对这两种情况，分别提出了多项式时间算法和基于凸松弛的优化方法。

Result: 提出的算法能够高效恢复奖励函数，并通过多个示例验证了恢复的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文通过先验假设和优化方法，解决了奖励函数恢复问题，并展示了算法的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering time-varying reward
functions from either optimal policies or demonstrations coming from a max
entropy reinforcement learning problem. This problem is highly ill-posed
without additional assumptions on the underlying rewards. However, in many
applications, the rewards are indeed parsimonious, and some prior information
is available. We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly
constant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a
linear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that
the reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a
sparsification problem subject to linear constraints. Moreover, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm that solves this sparsification problem exactly.
Then, we show that identifying rewards representable with the minimum number of
features can be recast as a rank minimization problem subject to linear
constraints, for which convex relaxations of rank can be invoked. In both
cases, these observations lead to efficient optimization-based reward
identification algorithms. Several examples are given to demonstrate the
accuracy of the recovered rewards as well as their generalizability.

Motivation: 闪电对人身安全和经济发展构成重大威胁，现有预测模型存在动态空间背景捕捉不足、数据利用不充分等问题。

Method: DeepLight利用雷达反射率、云属性等多源数据，采用双编码器架构和多分支卷积技术，引入Hazy Loss函数处理不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，DeepLight的公平威胁分数（ETS）比现有方法提高了18%-30%。

Conclusion: DeepLight是一种高效的闪电预测解决方案，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses
significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses.
These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate
prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,
protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present
DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning
occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they
often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty
of lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar
reflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly
sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight
leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud
properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder
architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically
captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel
Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of
lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling
the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments
show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over
state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning
prediction.

Conclusion: DOOL是一种高效的无监督方法，适用于耗散方程，并可扩展至不直接遵循Onsager变分原理的二阶波动模型。

Abstract: Existing operator learning methods rely on supervised training with
high-fidelity simulation data, introducing significant computational cost. In
this work, we propose the deep Onsager operator learning (DOOL) method, a novel
unsupervised framework for solving dissipative equations. Rooted in the Onsager
variational principle (OVP), DOOL trains a deep operator network by directly
minimizing the OVP-defined Rayleighian functional, requiring no labeled data,
and then proceeds in time explicitly through conservation/change laws for the
solution. Another key innovation here lies in the spatiotemporal decoupling
strategy: the operator's trunk network processes spatial coordinates
exclusively, thereby enhancing training efficiency, while integrated external
time stepping enables temporal extrapolation. Numerical experiments on typical
dissipative equations validate the effectiveness of the DOOL method, and
systematic comparisons with supervised DeepONet and MIONet demonstrate its
enhanced performance. Extensions are made to cover the second-order wave models
with dissipation that do not directly follow OVP.

Result: 在标准DQN变体上，SCORER提高了样本效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: 通过结构化感知与控制交互，无需复杂设计即可提升性能。

Abstract: Integrated, end-to-end learning of representations and policies remains a
cornerstone of deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, to address the
challenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent
trends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully
decoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity.
This work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end
learning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring
the interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a
principled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing
the Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)
framework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a
Stackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features
to benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize
its Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical
two-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks,
SCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance. Our results show that
performance gains can be achieved through principled algorithmic design of the
perception-control dynamic, without requiring complex auxiliary objectives or
architectures.

Abstract: Currently, various uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to
provide certainty and probability estimates for deep learning models' label
predictions. Meanwhile, with the growing demand for the right to be forgotten,
machine unlearning has been extensively studied as a means to remove the impact
of requested sensitive data from a pre-trained model without retraining the
model from scratch. However, the vulnerabilities of such generated predictive
uncertainties with regard to dedicated malicious unlearning attacks remain
unexplored. To bridge this gap, for the first time, we propose a new class of
malicious unlearning attacks against predictive uncertainties, where the
adversary aims to cause the desired manipulations of specific predictive
uncertainty results. We also design novel optimization frameworks for our
attacks and conduct extensive experiments, including black-box scenarios.
Notably, our extensive experiments show that our attacks are more effective in
manipulating predictive uncertainties than traditional attacks that focus on
label misclassifications, and existing defenses against conventional attacks
are ineffective against our attacks.

classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform
omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a
deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world
disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in
accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance
(e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains
computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and
provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and
the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight
MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in
multi-omics disease modeling.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注梯度估计方差有限的情况，但对重尾分布（梯度仅具有有限p阶中心矩）的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 分析了经典OCO算法（如在线梯度下降）在重尾梯度下的表现，无需额外操作（如梯度裁剪），并拓展到更广泛的场景（如平滑OCO）和乐观算法。

Conclusion: 重尾梯度下的OCO问题可通过经典算法有效解决，无需额外操作，且结果可推广到更复杂场景。

Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a
finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear
regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy
tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th
central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this
work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent)
in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain
assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any
algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in
all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting
that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation
(e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A
particularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for
nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient
clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and
extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases
simultaneously.

Result: 在12个基准数据集上表现优于其他方法，尤其在异质性时间序列上效果显著。

Conclusion: N-BEATS-MOE通过MoE层和门控机制提升了预测性能和可解释性，适用于复杂时间序列任务。

Abstract: Deep learning approaches are increasingly relevant for time series
forecasting tasks. Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on
benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable
relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into
different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work,
we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a
gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of
each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides
additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for
each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against
several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets,
especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分散式最小-最大优化中，模型更新共享可能暴露敏感数据，差分隐私虽能保护隐私，但噪声可能影响收敛性能。

Method: 基于STORM算法，提出DPMixSGD，通过添加噪声保护隐私，并理论证明噪声不影响收敛。

Result: 理论分析表明噪声不影响收敛，实验验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: DPMixSGD在保护隐私的同时，保持了分散式最小-最大优化的收敛性能。

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to
collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the
exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a
central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of
exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy
concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become
a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its
advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses
challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in
non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization
problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential
Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving
algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max
optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm,
one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that
the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise
convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy
guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive
experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Conclusion: FairDRL-ST为时空预测中的公平性问题提供了一种有效解决方案，平衡了公平性和性能，推动了AI在公共服务中的伦理部署。

Abstract: As deep spatio-temporal neural networks are increasingly utilised in urban
computing contexts, the deployment of such methods can have a direct impact on
users of critical urban infrastructure, such as public transport, emergency
services, and traffic management systems. While many spatio-temporal methods
focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to
growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can
disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups,
thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the
ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to
address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular
focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and
disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate
attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that
enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to
overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in
an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to
real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close
fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to
state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable bearing fault classification is critical for
ensuring the reliability of rotating machinery, particularly under variable
operating conditions where domain shifts can significantly degrade model
performance. This study proposes a physics-informed multimodal convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a late fusion architecture, integrating vibration and
motor current signals alongside a dedicated physics-based feature extraction
branch. The model incorporates a novel physics-informed loss function that
penalizes physically implausible predictions based on characteristic bearing
fault frequencies - Ball Pass Frequency Outer (BPFO) and Ball Pass Frequency
Inner (BPFI) - derived from bearing geometry and shaft speed. Comprehensive
experiments on the Paderborn University dataset demonstrate that the proposed
physics-informed approach consistently outperforms a non-physics-informed
baseline, achieving higher accuracy, reduced false classifications, and
improved robustness across multiple data splits. To address performance
degradation under unseen operating conditions, three transfer learning (TL)
strategies - Target-Specific Fine-Tuning (TSFT), Layer-Wise Adaptation Strategy
(LAS), and Hybrid Feature Reuse (HFR) - are evaluated. Results show that LAS
yields the best generalization, with additional performance gains when combined
with physics-informed modeling. Validation on the KAIST bearing dataset
confirms the framework's cross-dataset applicability, achieving up to 98
percent accuracy. Statistical hypothesis testing further verifies significant
improvements (p < 0.01) in classification performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates the potential of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven
learning to achieve robust, interpretable, and generalizable fault diagnosis
for real-world industrial applications.

Result: 该策略比轮询和随机策略减少推理误差高达55%。

Conclusion: 优化任务导向的AoI函数可显著提高远程推理的准确性。

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a
multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using
features collected from remote sensors. As sensor observations may change
dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks.
However, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due
to limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling
problem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a
penalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based
threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches
modalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold. We
show that the two modalities share the same threshold, and both the index
functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. The optimality of our
policy holds for (i) general AoI functions that are \emph{non-monotonic} and
\emph{non-additive} and (ii) \emph{heterogeneous} transmission times. Numerical
results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to
round-robin and uniform random policies, which are oblivious to the AoI-based
inference error function. Our results shed light on how to improve remote
inference accuracy by optimizing task-oriented AoI functions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how
uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,
focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is
low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty
signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By
ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,
post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep
ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.
Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),
allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find
that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains
robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty
trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective
classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --
identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions
can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking
errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show
that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or
deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining
calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,
and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make
accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".

noise injection and binary coefficient sampling. Through this framework, we
provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by
empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the
potential for offering new insights into understanding inference behaviors in
real-world language models.

Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the
following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector
field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the
data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate
this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical
systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our
perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal
learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target
density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.
Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the
support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive
infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the
boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient
condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.
Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for
robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the
tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation
analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements
and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative
models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty
quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical
generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative
models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the
manifold hypothesis.

Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that
demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding
performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many
excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are
still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to
incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth
analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow
from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long
CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies
for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a
small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large
number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better
results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues
with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical
exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO)
that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only
enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in
learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning
abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\%
on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based
generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a
measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior
$p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)
under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular
algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and
reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional
assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is
tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a
distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one
can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the
posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher
divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is
consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our
knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior
sampling in polynomial time.

Abstract: Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural
networks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input
variable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods
have been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains
unresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the
actual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The
faithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of
attribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core
challenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to
their unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and
implementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack
solid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,
ambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is
challenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a
promising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We
summarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)
Theoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among
methods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,
clarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,
rigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a
comprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen
theoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution
methods. We conclude with a discussion of promising open problems for further
work.

Abstract: Implicit continuous models, such as functional models and implicit neural
networks, are an increasingly popular method for replacing discrete data
representations with continuous, high-order, and differentiable surrogates.
These models offer new perspectives on the storage, transfer, and analysis of
scientific data. In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly
extract complex topological features -- contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley
graphs -- from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate
functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous
piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach
enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model,
without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily
generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of
function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building
blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit
continuous models.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires
moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While
collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and
scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle
with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In
this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first
derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a
key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference
conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it
to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our
principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by
the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality
of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the
selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical
methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our
PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying
conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%
relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a
stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting
training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference
annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained
preference signals.

Motivation: 研究多轮越狱攻击的漏洞，挑战其复杂性认知，并探讨其对AI安全评估和系统设计的影响。

Method: 使用StrongREJECT基准对GPT-4、Claude和Gemini等先进模型进行多轮越狱攻击的实证分析。

Result: 多轮攻击成功率与单轮攻击重复采样相当，攻击在相似模型间相关，且高推理努力可能导致更高成功率。

Conclusion: 研究结果对AI安全评估和抗越狱系统设计具有重要意义，并开源了相关代码。

Abstract: While defenses against single-turn jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have improved significantly, multi-turn jailbreaks remain a persistent
vulnerability, often achieving success rates exceeding 70% against models
optimized for single-turn protection. This work presents an empirical analysis
of automated multi-turn jailbreak attacks across state-of-the-art models
including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants, using the StrongREJECT benchmark.
Our findings challenge the perceived sophistication of multi-turn attacks: when
accounting for the attacker's ability to learn from how models refuse harmful
requests, multi-turn jailbreaking approaches are approximately equivalent to
simply resampling single-turn attacks multiple times. Moreover, attack success
is correlated among similar models, making it easier to jailbreak newly
released ones. Additionally, for reasoning models, we find surprisingly that
higher reasoning effort often leads to higher attack success rates. Our results
have important implications for AI safety evaluation and the design of
jailbreak-resistant systems. We release the source code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）系统在固定网格点上预测大气状态，但地球观测数据的位置不固定，导致空间相关性复杂且动态变化。研究目标是解决这一问题。

Method: 采用STGNNs结合结构学习，并通过自适应节点度数和空间距离调节边采样，以避免结构信息丢失和过平滑问题。

Result: 在东亚地区的真实数据实验中，该方法在高变异性区域表现优于现有STGNN模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了动态空间相关性问题，显著提升了大气状态预测的准确性。

Abstract: This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations
and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global
atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional
numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather
forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,
which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and
newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding
meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make
spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To
handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,
structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural
information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To
solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node
degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and
observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using
real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas
with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing
STGNN models with and without structure learning.

TL;DR: GLiClass是一种基于GLiNER架构的新方法，用于序列分类任务，兼顾高效性和灵活性，适用于零样本和小样本学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统需要处理大量数据，且分类需求动态变化，现有方法（如生成式LLM、交叉编码器和嵌入方法）在效率、准确性或灵活性上存在不足。

Method: 提出GLiClass方法，结合GLiNER架构，并采用近端策略优化（PPO）进行多标签文本分类训练。

Result: GLiClass在准确性和效率上与嵌入方法相当，同时保持了零样本和小样本学习的灵活性。

Conclusion: GLiClass为动态分类需求提供了一种高效、灵活且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications,
serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data.
Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early
pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and
accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change
dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot
capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot
classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent
instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly
used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must
process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with
large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle
with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose
GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence
classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency
comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed
for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted
proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification,
enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.

Conclusion: AIS-LLM为智能高效的海事交通管理提供了潜力。

Abstract: With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the
Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime
traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However,
existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it
difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series
AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series
Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a
Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data
and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture
enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single
end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms
existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.
Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation
summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent
and efficient maritime traffic management.

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了算法的性能，表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为语义缓存淘汰问题提供了理论基础，并展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with
information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability
and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be
retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one
possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the
semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.
Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic
similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:
one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached
responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities
and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing
semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations
and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a
principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown
query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online
learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms
with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic
dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior
performance compared with baselines.

Motivation: 联邦学习中社交网络连接的隐私外部性问题，即客户的隐私损失不仅取决于自身策略，还受他人决策影响。

Method: 提出多跳传播模型量化隐私泄漏，采用Stackelberg博弈设计激励机制，引入均值场估计器解决信息不对称问题。

Result: 理论证明了均值场估计器的收敛性和Stackelberg纳什均衡的存在性，实验显示方法在客户效用和服务器成本上优于基线。

Conclusion: 该机制在保持模型性能的同时，显著提升了客户效用并降低了服务器成本，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and
facilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks.
However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's
privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on
the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop
interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL
mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a
multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a
two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes
incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their
privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling
the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked
privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the
average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and
convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive
closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being
designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves
approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)
analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while
maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA)
baselines and methods that account for social externalities.

Conclusion: MORE-CLEAR首次将LLM能力引入多模态离线强化学习，为脓毒症管理提供了更全面的患者状态表示和治疗建议。

Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ
dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on
structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a
comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we
propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes
Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis
control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale
language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic
representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving
patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow
dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration
of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly
improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to
single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM
capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in
medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and
management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose
enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient
conditions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,
meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the
generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time
series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies
focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic
modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data
patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,
we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent
periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the
semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the
interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs
for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel
at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term
anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded
within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to
effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM
and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing
computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance
of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: The increasing demand for computational resources of training neural networks
leads to a concerning growth in energy consumption. While parallelization has
enabled upscaling model and dataset sizes and accelerated training, its impact
on energy consumption is often overlooked. To close this research gap, we
conducted scaling experiments for data-parallel training of two models,
ResNet50 and FourCastNet, and evaluated the impact of parallelization
parameters, i.e., GPU count, global batch size, and local batch size, on
predictive performance, training time, and energy consumption. We show that
energy consumption scales approximately linearly with the consumed resources,
i.e., GPU hours; however, the respective scaling factor differs substantially
between distinct model trainings and hardware, and is systematically influenced
by the number of samples and gradient updates per GPU hour. Our results shed
light on the complex interplay of scaling up neural network training and can
inform future developments towards more sustainable AI research.

Conclusion: 为Spiking Transformer的高效、可扩展部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Leveraging the event-driven paradigm, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a
promising approach for constructing energy-efficient Transformer architectures.
Compared to directly trained Spiking Transformers, ANN-to-SNN conversion
methods bypass the high training costs. However, existing methods still suffer
from notable limitations, failing to effectively handle nonlinear operations in
Transformer architectures and requiring additional fine-tuning processes for
pre-trained ANNs. To address these issues, we propose a high-performance and
training-free ANN-to-SNN conversion framework tailored for Transformer
architectures. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE)
neuron, which employs an exponential decay strategy and multi-basis encoding
method to efficiently approximate various nonlinear operations. It removes the
requirement for weight modifications in pre-trained ANNs. Extensive experiments
across diverse tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and mainstream Transformer architectures
(ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2) demonstrate that our method achieves near-lossless
conversion accuracy with significantly lower latency. This provides a promising
pathway for the efficient and scalable deployment of Spiking Transformers in
real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks can memorize corrupted labels, making data quality
critical for model performance, yet real-world datasets are frequently
compromised by both label noise and input noise. This paper proposes a mutual
information-based framework for data selection under hybrid noise scenarios
that quantifies statistical dependencies between inputs and labels. We compute
each sample's pointwise contribution to the overall mutual information and find
that lower contributions indicate noisy or mislabeled instances. Empirical
validation on MNIST with different synthetic noise settings demonstrates that
the method effectively filters low-quality samples. Under label corruption,
training on high-MI samples improves classification accuracy by up to 15\%
compared to random sampling. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness to
benign input modifications, preserving semantically valid data while filtering
truly corrupted samples.

Conclusion: HR3L提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于非理想通信环境下的RL训练。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL)
agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to
instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its
actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state
updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial
and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been
proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer
specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these
limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote
Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents
exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two
units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the
environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs
actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the
exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for
quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art
solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms
baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different
communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and
capacity limitations.

Conclusion: TRGE方法有效缓解了多领域持续学习中的遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-Domain Continual Learning (MDCL) acquires knowledge from sequential
tasks with shifting class sets and distribution. Despite the
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can adapt for this dual
heterogeneity, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and forward
forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped
Mixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the
pre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows
in this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and
introduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by
the increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing
policy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically
selects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task
collaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal
comprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize
the correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we
dynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE
adapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned
knowledge. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our method
outperforms other advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 理论条件不仅是证明的基础，也揭示了算法的局限性，提醒我们在条件不满足时需探索新方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed
dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the
environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant
theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental
challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with
practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we
explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for
offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function
representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation
conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage
assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine
counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically
large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all
algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to
mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for
offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs,
but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to
search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative
Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective
strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample
generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward
feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging
intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates
guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes
GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over
conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human
alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving
57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and
GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded
alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution
in language models.

### [392] [Sparse Probabilistic Graph Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07763)
*Martin Rektoris,Milan Papež,Václav Šmídl,Tomáš Pevný*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稀疏概率图电路（SPGCs），解决了现有概率图电路（PGCs）在密集图表示中的复杂度问题，将复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n+m)，适用于边数远小于节点数平方的稀疏图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度生成模型（DGMs）虽然表达能力强，但因非线性特性导致概率推断不可解。PGCs虽解决了可解性问题，但其复杂度高，不适用于稀疏图。

Method: 引入稀疏概率图电路（SPGCs），直接在稀疏图表示上操作，降低复杂度至O(n+m)。

Result: 实验证明SPGCs在药物设计中保留了精确推断能力，提高了内存效率和推断速度，性能与不可解DGMs相当。

Conclusion: SPGCs为稀疏图提供了一种高效、可解的概率生成模型，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs achieve impressively high expressive
power thanks to very efficient and scalable neural networks. However, these
networks contain non-linearities that prevent analytical computation of many
standard probabilistic inference queries, i.e., these DGMs are considered
\emph{intractable}. While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs)
address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, they
operate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity for
graphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue,
we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models that
operate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$. In the
context of de novo drug design, we empirically demonstrate that SPGCs retain
exact inference capabilities, improve memory efficiency and inference speed,
and match the performance of intractable DGMs in key metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出PAMA算法，解决大语言模型多目标对齐问题，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如RLHF）仅优化单一目标，无法满足实际应用中多样且冲突的人类偏好需求。

Method: 提出PAMA算法，将多目标强化学习转化为凸优化问题，计算复杂度从O(n^2*d)降至O(n)。

Result: 实验证明PAMA在125M至7B参数模型上高效且鲁棒，收敛至Pareto稳定点。

Conclusion: PAMA为多目标对齐提供了高效可行的解决方案，推动AI在实际应用中的适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting,
objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus
creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,
optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that
fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This
limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making
multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge
this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and
computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In
contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)
methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a
closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO
approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the
number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering
direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is
the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within
milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto
stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least
one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B
parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning
with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to
the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a
practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse
human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中，当面对困难问题时，奖励稀疏会导致学习效率低下和探索瓶颈。现有方法依赖于更强的LLM或过滤难题，限制了可扩展性或推理能力的提升。

Method: EvoCoT通过两阶段思维链优化，自我生成和验证思维链轨迹，逐步缩短轨迹以扩展探索空间。

Result: 实验表明，EvoCoT使LLM能够解决之前未解决的问题，无需外部思维链监督即可提升推理能力，且兼容多种RL微调方法。

Conclusion: EvoCoT为稀疏奖励下的LLM推理能力提升提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising
paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their
reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard
problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing
exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for
distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or
restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.
  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on
two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the
exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then
gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables
LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse
rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek,
and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously
unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT
supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release
the source code to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物理模型不完整或计算成本高的情况下，机器学习提供了一种灵活替代方案，但纯数据驱动模型在泛化和稳定性上存在不足。

Method: 采用Real NVP神经网络架构和自注意力机制，结合物理信息训练策略，与纯数据驱动基线进行比较。

Result: 物理信息模型的平均相对误差降低了27.08%，在MPC框架中控制精度和鲁棒性提升高达42.86%。

Conclusion: 物理信息的引入显著提升了模型性能，尤其在MPC应用中表现更优。

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,
relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions
over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,
difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a
flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.
However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and
stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To
address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft
attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven
approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network
architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on
simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies
were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant
to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion
of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of
the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These
advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into
an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely
data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding
improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased
robustness-to-noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟器（如AlphaFold）在自然科学中已取得显著成就，行为科学领域也亟需可靠的参与者模拟器以加速研究。

Method: 作者评估了Centaur（一种基于大型语言模型的参与者模拟器）的核心标准，特别是其预测准确性和生成行为。

Result: Centaur在预测准确性上表现良好，但其生成行为与人类数据存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: Centaur虽是人类行为预测的重要进展，但尚未达到可靠参与者模拟器或准确认知模型的标准。

Abstract: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural
sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena,
they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize
experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a
Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures
from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular
interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences,
a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like
behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative
advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM)
fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a
model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico
prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive
science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and
assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong
predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a
participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests
that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it
does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an
accurate model of cognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成建模中表现出色，但在数据有限的情况下容易过拟合。

Method: 提出ScoreAug框架，对噪声数据进行变换，并要求去噪器预测原始目标的增强，实现分数增强。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了ScoreAug的有效性，显著提升了性能并缓解了过拟合。

Conclusion: ScoreAug不仅能与传统数据增强技术结合，还能避免数据泄漏问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model
training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we
propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework
specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation
approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to
noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion.
Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation
of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning
objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising
spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also
theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under
general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on
multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with
results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines.
Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios,
such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable
convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data
augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under
certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically
combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional
performance gains.

Result: 框架在多种DNN架构上表现优异，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通用性强，能有效应对非平稳时间序列预测问题。

Abstract: Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary
environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance
by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN
is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset
is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the
series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the
base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique
pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against
the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed
based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates
a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns
caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable
across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance
gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in
the GluonTS library.

TL;DR: SHARK是一种基于Shapley值的特征加权聚类算法，无需额外参数调整，在高维或噪声数据中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法假设所有特征对数据结构贡献均等，但在高维或噪声场景下不成立。特征加权方法可解决此问题，但通常需要额外参数调整。

Method: SHARK利用Shapley值量化特征相关性，将k均值目标分解为各特征的Shapley值之和，并通过迭代重加权特征提升聚类效果。

Result: 实验表明，SHARK在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，尤其在噪声场景下表现出更强的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: SHARK为无监督特征相关性提供了理论基础，并在实际应用中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Clustering algorithms often assume all features contribute equally to the
data structure, an assumption that usually fails in high-dimensional or noisy
settings. Feature weighting methods can address this, but most require
additional parameter tuning. We propose SHARK (Shapley Reweighted $k$-means), a
feature-weighted clustering algorithm motivated by the use of Shapley values
from cooperative game theory to quantify feature relevance, which requires no
additional parameters beyond those in $k$-means. We prove that the $k$-means
objective can be decomposed into a sum of per-feature Shapley values, providing
an axiomatic foundation for unsupervised feature relevance and reducing Shapley
computation from exponential to polynomial time. SHARK iteratively re-weights
features by the inverse of their Shapley contribution, emphasising informative
dimensions and down-weighting irrelevant ones. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data sets show that SHARK consistently matches or outperforms
existing methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy, particularly in
scenarios where noise may be present. Software:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent
paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite
notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant
challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to
dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations
related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as
inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper,
we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple,
scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address
these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model
that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,
effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller
architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In
addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions
computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training
conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios,
demonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared
to state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been
successfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a
large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 基于扩展PI-DeepONet的交通状态估计方法显著提升了精度，为实时交通状态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories:
model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies
on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven
TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine
learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state
estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more
accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be
viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested
traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the
first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an
operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep
neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the
original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the
acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the
introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO
mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of
traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of
this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short
freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along
with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that
this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision
estimation results of flow and mean speed.

Conclusion: 双通道架构和图神经网络在组合算法选择中具有潜力，GAT-MLP为解决MCP算法选择问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique
algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the
importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through
an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of
research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique
Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that
integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to
address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP
algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by
structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first
evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random
Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple
dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong
performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.
In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and
topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building
on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which
combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model
shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results
highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of
graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning framework that enables edge
devices to collaboratively train ML models without sharing their local data. FL
faces, however, a significant challenge due to the high amount of information
that must be exchanged between the devices and the aggregator in the training
phase, which can exceed the limited capacity of wireless systems. In this
paper, two communication-efficient FL methods are considered where
communication overhead is reduced by communicating scalar values instead of
long vectors and by allowing high number of users to send information
simultaneously. The first approach employs a zero-order optimization technique
with two-point gradient estimator, while the second involves a first-order
gradient computation strategy. The novelty lies in leveraging channel
information in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for
additional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove
its impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices. We provide a
rigorous analytical framework for the two methods, deriving convergence
guarantees and establishing appropriate performance bounds.

Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and
reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized

real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method
using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and
deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption
in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric
vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with
mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and
cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models
performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%,
respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and
models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV
datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for
robust models for advanced powertrains.

Conclusion: 揭示了基于提示的联邦学习在实际部署中的脆弱性，需加强安全性研究。

Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full
fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via
learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to
federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively
train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security
implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning
remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack
targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In
BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and
prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation
process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling
universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters.
Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures,
BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal
visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness,
stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about
the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

*Supriyo Chakraborty,Krishnan Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为CLEMC的模型，用于描述持续学习中稳定性与可塑性平衡的动态行为，并通过理论和实验验证了其非平稳性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，研究神经网络在不同任务分布下的动态能力变化。

Method: 引入CLEMC模型，建立差分方程描述神经网络、任务数据和优化过程的交互，并通过多种架构的实验验证。

Result: 无论架构或优化方法如何，神经网络对新任务的表示能力会随任务分布变化而下降。

Conclusion: CLEMC揭示了持续学习中稳定性-可塑性平衡的非平稳性，为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN)
capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual
learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity
(CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity
balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the
interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then
leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension,
the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show
that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability
to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from
previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical
findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and
convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and
transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于迁移学习的预测流程监控（PPM）技术，帮助缺乏足够事件数据的组织实现有效的决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPM技术需要大量事件数据或其他资源，限制了部分组织的应用。本文旨在通过迁移学习解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种迁移学习技术，并在两个真实案例中实例化，通过IT服务管理流程的事件日志进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，可以将一个业务流程的知识迁移到相似流程中，实现有效的PPM。

Conclusion: 该技术使组织能够在内部和跨组织环境中利用迁移学习，提升决策支持能力。

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in
organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM)
transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that
provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime.
Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other
relevant resources that might not be readily available, preventing some
organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique
presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or
other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. The
technique is instantiated in two real-life use cases, based on which numerical
experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes
in an intra- and inter-organizational setting. The results of the experiments
suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar
business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective
PPM in the target context. With the proposed technique, organizations can
benefit from transfer learning in an intra- and inter-organizational setting,
where resources like pre-trained models are transferred within and across
organizational boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理供应链中复杂的多模态数据（如能力、认证、地理约束等），需要新方法提升匹配效率。

Method: 提出PMGraph基准数据集和C-MAG两阶段架构，先对齐多模态属性，再通过异构图多尺度消息传递优化链接预测。

Result: C-MAG在噪声环境下仍保持高性能，显著提升了制造商与产品链接预测的准确性。

Conclusion: PMGraph和C-MAG为供应链多模态数据匹配提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable
manufacturers and suppliers is critical for resilient, efficient global supply
chains, yet traditional methods struggle to capture complex capabilities,
certifications, geographic constraints, and rich multimodal data of real-world
manufacturer profiles. To address these gaps, we introduce PMGraph, a public
benchmark of bipartite and heterogeneous multimodal supply-chain graphs linking
8,888 manufacturers, over 70k products, more than 110k manufacturer-product
edges, and over 29k product images. Building on this benchmark, we propose the
Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graph C-MAG, a two-stage architecture that first
aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group
embeddings, then propagates them through a manufacturer-product hetero-graph
via multiscale message passing to enhance link prediction accuracy. C-MAG also
provides practical guidelines for modality-aware fusion, preserving predictive
performance in noisy, real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分类器的方法，通过预剪枝无效切割，显著提升逻辑优化速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逻辑优化算子计算成本高，且大部分切割尝试无效（平均失败率98%）。

Method: 利用分类器预判无效切割，避免不必要的重合成操作。

Result: 在EPFL基准套件和10个大型工业设计上测试，平均提速3.9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算成本，提升了逻辑优化效率。

Abstract: In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial
role in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation
demands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts
for each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often
fails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost
through parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to
prune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis
operations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite
and 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup
logic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC
implementation.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了符号分位数回归（SQR），用于预测条件分位数，并在透明性和性能上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前符号回归（SR）仅能估计目标变量的平均值，无法全面描述变量在分布其他点（如中位数或极值）的关系。SQR填补了这一空白，适用于高风险的领域。

Method: 提出符号分位数回归（SQR），通过符号回归预测条件分位数。

Result: SQR在透明模型上表现优异，与黑盒基线相当，同时保持透明性。案例研究展示了其在极端值和中心值预测中的应用。

Conclusion: SQR适用于预测条件分位数，并能解释不同分位数下特征的影响。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating
interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully
applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is
currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship
between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable.
Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture
of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in
high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces
Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional
quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms
transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline
without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain
differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme
and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR
is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting
feature influences at varying quantiles.

Motivation: 开发高物理保真度且速度快的锂离子电池数字孪生模型，以满足实时电池管理和大规模推断的需求。

Method: 训练三种算子学习模型（DeepONets、FNOs、PE-FNO）于模拟数据，评估其在不同电流负载下的性能，并测试PE-FNO在参数估计任务中的表现。

Result: PE-FNO在所有负载类型下保持电压误差低于1.7 mV，速度比传统SPM求解器快200倍，且在参数估计任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PE-FNO在速度、精度和参数灵活性上优于传统神经代理模型，为高保真电化学数字孪生提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical
fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three
operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator
Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed
parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each
spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are
trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant,
triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of
State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates
constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO
maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with
voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing
parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to
varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster
than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse
tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation,
recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute
percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in
comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural
operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of
real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference.
PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path
towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.

Conclusion: 该方案是一种轻量级、无需基础设施的实时室内导航解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, particularly where external positioning signals and dedicated
infrastructures are unavailable. This research presents Grid2Guide, a hybrid
navigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small
Language Model (SLM) to generate clear, human-readable route instructions. The
framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map.
Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin
and destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are
then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing
interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor
scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and
timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a
lightweight, infrastructure-free solution for real-time indoor navigation

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable
GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments.
This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that
integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based
navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural
network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position
using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation
module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to
interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions.
Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with
repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The
model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested
waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration
queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an
average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot
reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for
scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and
publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings
like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

Result: 在四个公开数据集上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: memoryKT通过完整编码-存储-检索循环建模，增强个体差异感知能力，表现优异。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery
from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a
promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:
encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests
during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,
undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as
well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes
memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational
autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process:
(i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii)
Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized
forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory
storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval
cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual
differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large-scale models pre-trained on Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown
promise in clinical applications such as neurological disorder detection.
However, the practical deployment of EEG-based large-scale models faces
critical challenges such as limited labeled EEG data and suboptimal performance
in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDx-LM, a novel
large-scale model specifically designed for detecting EEG-based neurological
disorders. Our key contributions include (i) a Selective Temporal-Frequency
Embedding mechanism that adaptively captures complex temporal and spectral
patterns in EEG signals; and (ii) a Progressive Feature-Aware Training strategy
that refines feature representation in a two-stage process. In the first stage,
our model learns the fundamental discriminative features of EEG activities; in
the second stage, the model further extracts more specialized fine-grained
features for accurate diagnostic performance. We evaluated NeuroDx-LM on the
CHB-MIT and Schizophrenia datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
EEG-based seizure and schizophrenia detection, respectively. These results
demonstrate the great potential of EEG-based large-scale models to advance
clinical applicability. Our code is available at

Abstract: In the active learning paradigm, using an oracle to label data has always
been a complex and expensive task, and with the emersion of large unlabeled
data pools, it would be highly beneficial If we could achieve better results
without relying on an oracle. This research introduces OFAL, an oracle-free
active learning scheme that utilizes neural network uncertainty. OFAL uses the
model's own uncertainty to transform highly confident unlabeled samples into
informative uncertain samples. First, we start with separating and quantifying
different parts of uncertainty and introduce Monte Carlo Dropouts as an
approximation of the Bayesian Neural Network model. Secondly, by adding a
variational autoencoder, we go on to generate new uncertain samples by stepping
toward the uncertain part of latent space starting from a confidence seed
sample. By generating these new informative samples, we can perform active
learning and enhance the model's accuracy. Lastly, we try to compare and
integrate our method with other widely used active learning sampling methods.

Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit
design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,
inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit
design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we
propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for
circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design
research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +
Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step
information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,
capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses
grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing
of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive
analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,
automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.
Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM
decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over
arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard
LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining
the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,
overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To
evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval
and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep
reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8%
accuracy on Reas-100.

Result: 在多个数据集和DNN模型上的实验表明，FairFLRep在提升公平性同时保持准确性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FairFLRep在故障定位和修复阶段均考虑了公平性，且效率高于基线方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being utilized in various aspects of our
daily lives, including high-stakes decision-making applications that impact
individuals. However, these systems reflect and amplify bias from the data used
during training and testing, potentially resulting in biased behavior and
inaccurate decisions. For instance, having different misclassification rates
between white and black sub-populations. However, effectively and efficiently
identifying and correcting biased behavior in DNNs is a challenge. This paper
introduces FairFLRep, an automated fairness-aware fault localization and repair
technique that identifies and corrects potentially bias-inducing neurons in DNN
classifiers. FairFLRep focuses on adjusting neuron weights associated with
sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, that contribute to unfair
decisions. By analyzing the input-output relationships within the network,
FairFLRep corrects neurons responsible for disparities in predictive quality
parity. We evaluate FairFLRep on four image classification datasets using two
DNN classifiers, and four tabular datasets with a DNN model. The results show
that FairFLRep consistently outperforms existing methods in improving fairness
while preserving accuracy. An ablation study confirms the importance of
considering fairness during both fault localization and repair stages. Our
findings also show that FairFLRep is more efficient than the baseline
approaches in repairing the network.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种随机子集聚合策略，用于改进联邦学习在癫痫发作预测中的性能，解决了数据异构性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发跨多个临床站点的癫痫发作预测模型时，患者隐私法规和数据异构性（非独立同分布特性）是主要障碍。联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护的协作训练框架，但标准聚合方法（如FedAvg）在异构设置中可能受到主导数据集的偏见影响。

Method: 论文采用单通道EEG数据，提出了一种隐私保护的全局归一化和随机子集聚合策略，确保每个客户端在每轮训练中使用固定大小的随机子集，以实现公平的聚合贡献。

Result: 实验表明，标准加权FedAvg在异构数据上表现不均衡（如CHB-MIT准确率89.0%，但Helsinki和NCH仅为50.8%和50.6%），而随机子集聚合显著提高了低代表性客户端的性能（Helsinki和NCH准确率分别提升至81.7%和68.7%），并实现了77.1%的宏平均准确率和80.0%的总体准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了平衡的联邦学习方法在构建有效且泛化的癫痫发作预测系统中的潜力，同时尊重数据隐私，适用于现实中的异构多医院环境。

Abstract: Developing accurate and generalizable epileptic seizure prediction models
from electroencephalography (EEG) data across multiple clinical sites is
hindered by patient privacy regulations and significant data heterogeneity
(non-IID characteristics). Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
framework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like
Federated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in
heterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using
a single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,
Helsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,
neonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global
normalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each
client trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring
equal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained
models fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields
highly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on
Helsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation
significantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy
increases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior
macro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,
demonstrating a more robust and fair global model. This work highlights the
potential of balanced FL approaches for building effective and generalizable
seizure prediction systems in realistic, heterogeneous multi-hospital
environments while respecting data privacy.

Conclusion: Neural Logic Networks通过逻辑扩展和改进算法，实现了高性能与可解释性的结合，尤其在需要透明决策的领域（如医疗）具有实际价值。

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance,
but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic
Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to
learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR
operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that
take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and
probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use.
We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well
as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in
Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules
in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where
interpretability has tangible value.

Motivation: 脑机接口在个性化音乐干预中因主体间EEG信号差异和运动伪影等问题泛化能力受限，需要长时间校准。

Method: 提出ITSA方法，结合主题特定的重新中心化、分布匹配和监督旋转对齐，并采用混合架构融合RCSP和黎曼几何。

Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting
motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide
external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait
patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for
adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject
variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts
and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and
results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space
Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific
recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to
enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised
Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and
sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the
geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.
Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant
performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion
approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with
robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode
configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of
publication.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent
research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both
algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,
several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized
guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their
underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,
variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led
to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these
techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting
appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL
techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a
unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable
scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained
experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and
architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for
selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable
roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we
reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning
capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results
demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance,
surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

Motivation: 理解Transformer如何通过训练获得多步推理能力，尤其是从理论角度分析其机制。

Method: 分析两个任务：反向推理（从目标节点到根的路径）和更复杂的前向推理（先找目标到根路径，再反转）。通过梯度下降动态分析单层Transformer的能力。

Result: 训练后的单层Transformer可解决这两个任务，并具有泛化能力。前向推理的多阶段训练动态揭示了注意力头的分工与协作。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使浅层多头Transformer也能通过结构化任务解决复杂问题，为推理能力的涌现提供了机制解释。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step
reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which
they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from
a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to
solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought
processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:
a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to
the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements
two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then
reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,
grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer
transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to
unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward
reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and
coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive
path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained
transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they
offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when
tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow
multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise
require deeper architectures.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

Conclusion: 通过系统研究，为提升LLM驱动的医学影像系统的安全性和可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Conclusion: SAGCNet为MRI缺失切片合成提供了高效解决方案，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its
clinical applicability.

Result: 在200个基因的实验中，HaDM-ST在空间保真度和基因级一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HaDM-ST为高分辨率ST生成提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了预测质量。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and

Result: 实验显示DiffVC-OSD在感知压缩性能上达到最优，解码速度快20倍，比特率降低86.92%。

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD在视频压缩领域实现了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: ALDEN通过整合解剖语义信息，显著提升了低剂量CT去噪的效果，为医学影像分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成女性盆腔图像时解剖精度不足，限制了其在妇科影像中的应用。数据稀缺和隐私问题也是关键挑战。

Method: 结合无条件与条件化的DDPMs和LDMs（2D和3D），生成解剖一致且高保真的合成图像。

Result: 合成图像质量高，接近真实扫描，显著提升诊断准确性，并通过专家盲评验证临床真实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为妇科影像提供了高质量合成数据，支持可重复研究和公平AI发展。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床加权MRI的定量图像合成需要更高的准确性和泛化能力，传统深度学习方法难以满足需求。

Method: 设计物理驱动的神经网络，嵌入TR、TE和TI参数，输入T1、T2和T2-FLAIR图像，合成T1、T2和PD定量图。

Result: 在内部和外部测试集上表现优异，PSNR>34 dB，SSIM>0.92，泛化能力优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 嵌入MRI序列参数显著提升定量MRI合成的性能和可靠性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence
parameters to improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative image
synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红细胞形态分析对血液病诊断至关重要，但目前缺乏全面的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise
morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders.
Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive
AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a
self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses
an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and
is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse
acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification.
Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor
classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and
generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model
tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations
for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance.
RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing
nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable
diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are
available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can
be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at
