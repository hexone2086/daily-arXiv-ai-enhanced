*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO是首个基于视频一致性模型的零样本视频恢复求解器，通过利用VCMs的时序因果性，在保证测量一致性和时间平滑性的同时，显著提升了高分辨率视频重建的感知质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像LDM的方法在视频恢复中存在时间不一致性问题，需要开发能够同时恢复精细空间细节和捕捉微妙时间依赖性的视频恢复方法。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)作为先验，提出LVTINO零样本求解器，绕过自动微分需求，通过少量神经网络评估实现高质量视频重建。

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上，相比逐帧应用图像LDM的方法，LVTINO在重建保真度和计算效率方面均实现了显著提升，建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: LVTINO通过整合视频一致性模型，成功解决了视频恢复中的时间一致性问题，为高分辨率视频逆问题提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于风格提取的三阶段图像生成方法，通过风格编码器和投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐，实现细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型中细粒度风格难以用自然语言精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的引导信息难以与传统文本条件直接对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用风格编码器和风格投影层提取单张风格参考图像的细粒度风格表示，并将其注入到预训练生成模型中，不改变下游生成模型的结构框架。构建了包含图像、风格标签和文本描述三元组的Style30k-captions数据集。

Result: 实现了细粒度控制的风格化图像生成，能够从单张风格参考图像中提取风格表示并与文本条件对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法能够最大化预训练生成模型的生成能力，通过风格提取和表示对齐实现细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于检测技能学习中挣扎行为的时序动作定位数据集EvoStruggle，包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频和5,385个标注的挣扎片段，涵盖四种不同活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集未关注技能获取过程中挣扎行为的演变，而理解这种演变对于优化人类学习和开发辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 收集了76名参与者完成18个任务的视频数据，每个任务重复5次以捕捉技能演变。将挣扎检测定义为时序动作定位问题，使用TAL模型识别和定位挣扎片段。

Result: TAL模型能够成功学习检测挣扎线索，在未见任务上达到34.56%的平均mAP，在未见活动上达到19.24%的平均mAP，表明挣扎概念在不同技能任务间具有可迁移性。

Conclusion: 挣扎是一个可跨任务迁移的概念，但挣扎检测仍面临挑战需要进一步改进。数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的偏微分方程求解基础模型，使用轻量级残差U-Net架构，通过自回归预训练策略学习物理规律，在多种下游PDE任务上达到最先进性能且参数效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂transformer架构，计算和参数开销大，需要开发更紧凑高效的统一神经算子。

Method: 采用轻量级残差U-Net架构，使用自回归预训练策略模拟数值求解器行为，在多样化流体动力学PDE数据集上预训练。

Result: 在6个未见下游PDE任务上达到最先进泛化性能，所需参数显著减少且微调数据需求最小。

Conclusion: SPUS展示了作为参数高效基础模型解决多样化PDE系统的潜力，残差U-Net架构在该领域具有良好前景。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过多样性约束直接优化多人生成中的身份多样性，解决了文本到图像模型在多人提示下重复面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型在现实主义方面表现出色，但在处理多人生成提示时会出现面孔重复、身份合并和个体计数错误的问题。

Method: 使用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)微调流匹配模型，采用组合奖励函数：(i)惩罚图像内面部相似性，(ii)阻止跨样本身份重复，(iii)确保准确的人员计数，(iv)通过人类偏好评分保持视觉保真度。采用单阶段课程学习来稳定训练。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo实现了98.6%的独特面孔准确率和接近完美的全局身份分布，超越了开源和专有方法（如Gemini、GPT-Image），同时保持了竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo是一个可扩展、无需额外标注的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机问题，为组合式多人生成设定了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与分层地理嵌入对齐，结合外观特征和语义分割图，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球视觉地理定位旨在仅使用图像视觉内容确定其在地球上的地理位置，现有的地理表示学习方法仍有改进空间。

Method: 将地理定位建模为查询图像视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐，使用分层地理嵌入表示世界，并融合图像外观特征和语义分割图形成鲁棒视觉表示。

Result: 在5个基准数据集的25个指标中，22个指标超过了先前最先进方法和大型视觉语言模型，创造了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 性能提升主要归功于地理表示和视觉表示的有效结合，证明了该方法在视觉地理定位任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAS是首个针对大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的数据高效指令调优方法，通过基于跨模态注意力矩阵相似性聚类来消除训练数据冗余，能在保留模型性能的同时大幅减少训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在大型视觉语言模型上表现不佳，甚至无法超越随机选择，需要开发专门针对LVLMs的数据高效学习方法。

Method: 证明具有相似跨模态注意力矩阵的示例具有相似梯度，基于此提出XMAS方法：通过聚类注意力矩阵的顶部奇异值轨迹，从聚类中平衡采样子集。

Result: XMAS能丢弃LLaVA-665k数据集的50%和Vision-Flan数据集的85%，同时完全保留LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准上的性能，训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: XMAS是首个在LVLMs上有效的数据选择方法，能显著减少训练数据冗余并加速训练，比最佳基线多减少30%数据。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

### [8] [Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478)
*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于向量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，通过在连续嵌入空间中学习分类后验分布，结合了连续方法的几何感知和分类方法的离散监督优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将连续传输动力学与离散监督相结合，为向量量化图像生成提供明确的分类监督，同时保持连续传输动态。

Method: 通过在学习连续嵌入空间中的速度场的同时，学习码书索引的分类后验分布，将变分流匹配适应于向量量化潜在表示。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务上，训练收敛速度比连续流匹配和离散流匹配基线更快，同时达到与最先进模型相当的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配能够有效桥接连续传输和离散监督，提高图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的深度学习框架，从非对比CT扫描生成合成对比增强CT图像，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，通过条件扩散模型和多任务学习实现端到端联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对比增强CT检查需要碘造影剂，存在肾毒性、患者过敏和环境危害等风险。现有方法采用多阶段流程，导致错误累积且无法利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 集成条件扩散模型与多任务学习，共享编码器和解码器参数，采用半监督训练策略处理缺失分割标签的临床数据，无需初始预测。

Result: 在264名患者队列中，PSNR达25.61 dB（单任务CDM为23.80 dB），腔Dice分数提升至0.89（nnU-Net为0.87），血栓Dice分数提升至0.53（nnU-Net为0.48），腔直径MAE降至4.19 mm（nnU-Net为5.78 mm）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化图像合成和解剖分割，显著提升了合成图像质量和分割精度，为减少造影剂使用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

### [10] [From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513)
*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多模态内容分析的高效原型框架，将预训练模型融合到视频处理流程中，生成可查询的知识图谱表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析复杂且计算昂贵，现有预训练模型难以有效融合处理视频等复杂数据，需要简化工程实现

Method: 设计候选流程配方，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时序半结构化数据，再转换为帧级索引知识图谱

Result: 实现了可查询的知识图谱表示，支持持续学习，能够通过交互方式动态整合新的领域特定知识

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态内容分析提供了高效原型设计方法，简化了复杂数据处理流程

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT框架通过逆向工程将网站功能转化为可调用工具，让Web代理直接调用高层操作而非逐步UI交互，提高了浏览器自动化的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Web代理方法依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理，在动态布局和长任务中表现脆弱。相比之下，人类使用网站提供的高层功能如搜索、筛选、排序等。

Method: WALT逆向工程网站潜在功能，将其转化为可重用的调用工具，包括发现（搜索、筛选、排序）、通信（发布、评论、点赞）和内容管理（创建、编辑、删除）等操作。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena测试中，WALT以更少步骤和更少LLM依赖实现了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: WALT建立了鲁棒且可泛化的浏览器自动化范式，将计算负担从脆弱的逐步推理转移到可靠的工具调用。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于组织病理学图像半监督分割的框架，通过拓扑一致性机制来识别和保留有意义的语义结构，减少拓扑错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从未标记数据中捕获有意义的语义结构至关重要，特别是在组织病理学图像分析中，物体密集分布，这尤其具有挑战性。

Method: 利用通过随机dropout和时间训练快照获得的多个扰动预测，强制这些不同输出之间的拓扑一致性，并引入结合空间重叠和全局结构对齐的新型匹配策略。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法有效减少了拓扑错误，产生了更稳健和准确的分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法对于可靠的下游分析至关重要，能够生成更稳健和准确的分割结果。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion-LPO框架，通过列表偏好优化方法改进扩散模型与人类偏好的对齐效果，相比成对偏好优化方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法主要依赖成对偏好，但人类对图像的偏好反馈通常包含隐含的排序信息，能更精确地表达偏好。列表偏好优化在扩散模型中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce模型推导列表扩展的DPO目标，给定标题时将用户反馈聚合成图像排名列表，通过鼓励每个样本优于其所有低排名替代品来保持整个排名的一致性。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO在视觉质量和偏好对齐方面持续优于成对DPO基线方法。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO是一个简单有效的列表偏好优化框架，能够更好地利用人类反馈中的排序信息来对齐扩散模型与人类偏好。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成的统一多模态大语言模型具有挑战性：混合方法破坏了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间存在权衡。

Method: 使用混合Transformer架构增强预训练视觉理解模型的生成能力，并提出语义到像素的离散表示，将紧凑语义token与细粒度像素token相结合。

Result: 在多样化多模态基准测试中，Bridge在理解和生成基准上都取得了竞争性或更优的结果，同时需要更少的训练数据和更短的训练时间。

Conclusion: Bridge证明了纯自回归方法可以实现高质量的多模态理解和生成，通过语义到像素表示在序列长度仅增加7.9%的情况下实现了强大的语言对齐和视觉细节描述。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于小数据集下的口腔癌分类，通过变分推理进行不确定性量化，在数据稀缺环境下提高了模型的可靠性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌是全球高发癌症，在医疗资源匮乏地区死亡率高。传统深度学习模型需要大数据集，在训练数据有限时容易过拟合且可靠性不足，难以在现实医疗环境中应用。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络与贝叶斯深度学习相结合的混合模型，采用变分推理方法进行不确定性量化，使用智能手机拍摄的彩色图像进行训练。

Result: 在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，与传统CNN相当；在真实世界图像数据上表现更优，达到88%准确率（传统CNN为72.94%）。模型对正确分类样本置信度高，对错误分类样本不确定性高。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境下能有效提升口腔癌早期诊断的模型可靠性和泛化能力，为医疗资源匮乏地区的癌症筛查提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Motivation: 现有无源域自适应方法主要关注评估目标域中与源域相似的不变特征，但这些方法容易受到困难样本和域偏差的影响，无法充分表示多样性。

Method: 构建辅助域模块从中间聚合全局注意力获得多样化表示；基于辅助域和目标域，通过多重一致性策略获取不变特征表示来区分简单和困难样本；使用条件多核最大均值差异策略对齐困难样本到对应的简单样本。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C和DomainNet-126等多个基准数据集上进行广泛实验，证明了所提方法带来的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: CADTrans方法通过构建域一致性的不变特征表示，有效解决了无源域自适应中的困难样本和域偏差问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著性能改进。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个系统，利用BLV用户的历史视觉问题来指导多模态大语言模型生成更相关的图像描述，而不是默认的冗长描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM应用通常提供冗长、全面的描述，而不管上下文，导致BLV用户需要筛选大量无关信息才能获得所需的具体信息。

Method: 系统从VizWiz-LF数据集中识别相似的过往视觉上下文，并使用相关的问题来指导MLLM生成更符合BLV用户需求的描述。

Result: 评估显示，76.1%的情况下上下文感知描述能够预测并回答用户问题，在54.4%的比较中被用户偏好。

Conclusion: 利用BLV用户的历史视觉问题来指导MLLM可以生成更相关、更高效的图像描述，显著改善用户体验。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of
VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable
the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法NPN，通过神经网络在感知矩阵零空间的低维投影中寻找解，而不是在图像域施加结构约束，提高了逆问题重建的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆问题求解方法通常忽略感知矩阵零空间的特定结构，而NPN方法专门利用零空间的结构信息来约束解空间，提供更精确的重建。

Method: 使用神经网络构建感知矩阵零空间的低维投影，在该投影空间中寻找解，可以与现有重建框架兼容，并补充传统的图像域先验。

Result: 在压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨率、CT和MRI等多种成像逆问题中，NPN先验能持续提高重建保真度，适用于plug-and-play方法、展开网络、深度图像先验和扩散模型。

Conclusion: NPN方法通过关注感知矩阵零空间的结构，提供了一种可解释且灵活的正则化策略，显著提升了各种成像逆问题的重建性能。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该工作为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化建立了可靠基础，实现了可解释基因组建模与自动化决策之间的桥梁。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型缺乏显式的逐步推理过程，忽视功能约束和几何关系，且后训练流程很少强化推理质量。

Method: 集成RLVR和GRPO进行系统优化，设计基于可验证奖励的后训练策略，并构建VLA-CoT-13K高质量数据集提供思维链监督。

Result: 在领域内、领域外、仿真和真实机器人平台上的广泛评估显示，VLA-R1相比先前VLA方法具有更优越的泛化能力和真实世界性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过强化推理能力显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合去模糊和3D重建的方法，用于解决微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，通过可微分渲染自监督优化3D模型和散焦模糊核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影具有高分辨率和大放大倍率的优势，但散焦模糊严重阻碍了清晰成像和高质量3D重建。传统去模糊方法需要大量图像和标注，且目前没有针对微距摄影的多视角3D重建方法。

Method: 从多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微分渲染方法，自监督优化3D模型和散焦模糊核。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量多视角图像出发，该方法不仅能实现高质量图像去模糊，还能恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，实现了联合去模糊和3D重建，为小物体的高质量3D建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Result: 在全参考指标上达到优越性能，超越之前的扩散方法，与其他最先进模型性能相当。

Conclusion: FideDiff为预训练扩散模型在高保真图像恢复任务中的应用提供了新方向，为工业应用建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青铜器铭文识别面临严重视觉退化、多域变异性（照片、拓片、摹本）和极端长尾字符分布的挑战，需要专门的方法来解决。

Method: 构建大规模BI数据集（22454页图像，198598个标注字符），开发两阶段检测-识别流程，使用LadderMoE增强CLIP编码器实现动态专家专业化。

Result: 在单字符和全页识别任务上显著优于现有场景文本识别方法，在头部、中部和尾部类别以及所有采集模态上均取得优越准确率。

Conclusion: 为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析建立了坚实基础，展示了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirDA是一种参数高效的域自适应方法，通过视觉重编程层生成视觉提示来调整输入图像的纹理风格，而不需要微调整个骨干网络，实现了跨域重用骨干网络参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的UDA方法需要为每个新的源-目标对微调已经训练好的骨干网络参数，导致训练参数和存储内存随新对线性增长，且无法重用这些训练好的骨干参数。

Method: VirDA在骨干网络前添加域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为纹理偏置来调整输入图像的风格。使用多目标函数优化域内和域间分布差异，无需修改骨干网络参数。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上达到92.8%的平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数。相比PDA方法准确率提升1.6%，参数使用减少54%。相比全骨干微调方法，参数使用仅需1.7%-2.8%。

Conclusion: VirDA提供了一种参数高效的域自适应解决方案，通过视觉重编程实现了骨干网络参数的跨域重用，在保持竞争力的性能同时大幅减少了参数需求。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的离散面部编码(DFE)方法，通过RVQ-VAE从3D网格序列学习紧凑可解释的面部表情字典，在心理任务中优于FACS和其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情编码系统如FACS存在覆盖范围有限和手动标注成本高的问题，需要一种数据驱动的替代方案。

Method: 使用3DMM提取身份不变的表情特征，然后通过RVQ-VAE编码这些特征，生成来自共享码本的离散token序列，每个token捕获特定的可重用面部变形模式。

Result: DFE比FACS和其他面部编码方法捕获更精确的面部行为，在压力检测、性格预测和抑郁检测等心理任务中表现优于FACS和MAE等模型。

Conclusion: DFE作为FACS的可扩展有效替代方案，具有更广泛的面部显示覆盖范围，适用于心理和情感计算应用。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Method: 使用基于图的框架优化2D选定图像扭曲进行逐点重建，采用并行可分离迭代优化策略，并结合自监督学习框架生成带纹理的密集3D点云。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的仿真和实验结果表明，该方法在重建精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UniVerse框架，将鲁棒3D重建分解为修复和重建两个子任务，使用视频扩散模型处理不一致的多视角图像，实现更好的泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从不一致多视角图像进行3D重建的挑战，现有方法依赖密集观测且优化困难，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 将鲁棒重建分解为修复和重建两个子任务：先转换不一致图像为初始视频，使用专门设计的视频扩散模型修复为一致图像，最后从修复图像重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有强大的泛化能力和优越的鲁棒重建性能，并能控制重建3D场景的风格。

Conclusion: UniVerse通过解耦修复和重建任务，利用扩散模型学习通用场景先验，有效处理多样化的图像不一致问题，显著提升了鲁棒3D重建的性能。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [29] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级端到端模板匹配框架，将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归问题，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立缩放比例，在复杂背景下实现高效的目标姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过穷举角度和尺度效率低下，而深度学习方法仅估计相似度得分而不显式建模几何姿态，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 使用模板感知动态卷积模块动态注入模板特征，结合深度可分离卷积和像素重排实现高效匹配，采用旋转-剪切增强策略进行无几何标注训练，并添加轻量级细化模块提升精度。

Result: 3.07M参数的模型在复合变换下实现高精度和14ms推理速度，在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法适合实时工业应用部署，在复杂背景下实现了高效准确的模板匹配和姿态估计。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

### [30] [Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01681)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个自适应像素推理框架，通过动态确定必要的像素级操作来提升视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的性能，同时显著减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理需要精确理解细粒度视觉元素的任务时表现不佳，主要由于图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。虽然引入像素级视觉信息有所帮助，但往往被过度使用，导致效率低下和无关视觉细节的干扰。

Method: 首先应用操作感知的监督微调建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计基于模型自身响应反馈的rollout引导强化学习框架，使VLM能够根据查询难度动态决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型实现了卓越性能，同时显著减少了不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上达到73.4%准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比之前方法在提高准确率的同时减少了66.5%的工具使用。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应像素推理框架有效解决了VLM在细粒度视觉任务中的挑战，通过动态决策机制实现了性能提升与效率优化的平衡。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于增强敏感性的风险评分框架（ASRS），用于识别胸片中的易错病例，通过测量图像旋转后的嵌入变化来评估模型稳定性，提高医疗AI的公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸片解读中表现良好，但在患者亚组间存在准确性不均的问题，现有错误检测方法难以处理分布内的细微错误，需要更有效的错误识别手段。

Method: 使用临床合理的旋转增强（±15°/±30°），通过RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化，计算敏感性评分将样本分为稳定性四分位数。

Result: 高敏感性病例的召回率显著降低（-0.2至-0.3），尽管具有高AUROC和置信度，ASRS能够有效识别易错样本。

Conclusion: ASRS提供了一种无需标签的选择性预测和临床医生审查方法，能够改善医疗AI的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

TL;DR: FreeViS是一个无需训练的视频风格化框架，通过整合多个风格化参考到预训练的图像到视频模型，生成具有丰富风格细节和强时间一致性的风格化视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频风格化方法存在时间一致性差、风格丰富度不足的问题，而训练专用模型需要配对视频数据且计算成本高昂。

Method: 将多个风格化参考整合到预训练I2V模型，使用高频补偿约束内容布局和运动，结合基于光流的运动线索保留低显著性区域的风格纹理。

Result: FreeViS在风格化保真度和时间一致性方面优于现有基线方法，获得强烈的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 该无需训练流程为高质量、时间一致性的视频风格化提供了实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

TL;DR: 提出了MedQ-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在医学图像质量评估中的感知和推理能力，包含2,600个感知查询和708个推理评估，涵盖5种成像模态和40多个质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量评分指标，无法反映专家评估中的人类推理过程，需要建立更符合人类推理的评估范式。

Method: 引入MedQ-Bench基准，定义两个任务：MedQ-Perception（低层感知能力）和MedQ-Reasoning（无参考和比较推理任务），并提出多维评判协议评估模型输出。

Result: 评估14个最先进的MLLM显示，模型表现出初步但不稳定的感知和推理技能，临床使用的准确性不足。

Conclusion: MLLM在医学图像质量评估方面需要针对性优化，MedQ-Bench将促进该领域的进一步探索。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在理解实例级几何关系时面临挑战，需要昂贵的输入格式（类别标签、二值分割掩码）和二次方的前向传播成本。

Method: InstaFormer利用对象查询与潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，这些描述符语义上表示相同对象但携带互补信息，实现整体排序预测。

Result: 通过全面基准测试和消融实验验证了方法的有效性，代码和模型已开源。

Conclusion: InstaFormer能够仅从RGB图像中高效预测场景中所有实例的遮挡和深度排序，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

TL;DR: PyramidStyler是一个基于Transformer的神经风格迁移框架，通过金字塔位置编码和强化学习优化，实现了高效的高分辨率图像风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在处理复杂风格和高分辨率输入时存在效率和可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出Pyramidal Positional Encoding（PPE）分层多尺度编码来捕捉局部细节和全局上下文，同时降低计算负载；并引入强化学习动态优化风格化过程。

Result: 在COCO和WikiArt数据集上训练4000轮后，内容损失降低62.6%至2.07，风格损失降低57.4%至0.86，推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后内容损失进一步降至2.03，风格损失0.75，速度仅略微增加至1.40秒。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了实时高质量的艺术渲染，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分治方法在大规模无边界场景中存在严重负载不平衡问题，且粗到细流水线效率低下，需要重新设计大规模3DGS流水线。

Method: 提出深度感知分区方法减少预处理时间，采用基于优化的策略平衡可见高斯分布，并引入可见性裁剪和选择性致密化两种轻量级技术。

Result: 在大规模城市和户外数据集上，LoBE-GS比现有最优方法快2倍，保持重建质量的同时实现了vanilla 3DGS无法处理的场景扩展。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS成功解决了大规模3DGS的负载平衡和效率问题，为大规模场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临双重挑战：需要捕捉长期依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中固有的错误累积。

Method: 1. MemoryPack：可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖，实现分钟级时间一致性；2. Direct Forcing：高效的单步近似策略，改善训练-推理对齐，减少推理过程中的错误传播。

Result: 该方法在计算效率上表现良好，保持线性复杂度，能够优雅地适应视频长度变化，显著提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing的结合显著增强了自回归视频模型在长视频生成中的实际可用性，为解决长期依赖和错误累积问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Motivation: 在自主系统中，精确的目标检测和不确定性估计对于自感知和安全操作至关重要。现有方法主要关注主导类别的校准，而忽略了全类别预测分布的校准需求。

Method: 提出了两种辅助正则化损失项：一种校准主导预测，另一种校准全预测向量。结合等渗回归方法，在CenterPoint、PillarNet和DSVT-Pillar等模型上进行评估。

Result: 结合全类别预测校准损失项和等渗回归的方法在CenterPoint和PillarNet上实现了最佳校准效果，但DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主导和次要预测。

Conclusion: 全类别预测分布的校准对于3D目标检测器至关重要，提出的方法在多个模型上有效提升了校准性能，但不同模型可能需要特定的校准策略。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人员搜索方法主要使用ImageNet预训练骨干网络，可能无法有效捕捉复杂空间上下文和细粒度身份线索。同时，共享骨干网络特征会导致检测和重识别任务的优化目标冲突。

Method: 提出DiffPS框架，利用预训练扩散模型，包含三个模块：扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)用于改进人员定位，多尺度频率细化网络(MSFRN)减轻形状偏差，语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 扩散先验知识能有效解决人员搜索中检测和重识别任务的优化冲突，提出的DiffPS框架显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像成本高且重建困难，现有压缩感知系统如CASSI虽然提高了效率，但重建精度仍受严重退化和光谱细节丢失的挑战。

Method: 将流匹配嵌入深度展开框架，引入平均速度损失来增强流的全局一致性，结合基于优化方法的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，FMU在重建质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU成功将流匹配集成到HSI重建中，通过混合设计实现了更鲁棒和准确的重建性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction

### [41] [Automated Defect Detection for Mass-Produced Electronic Components Based on YOLO Object Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01914)
*Wei-Lung Mao,Chun-Chi Wang,Po-Heng Chou,Yen-Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习和ConSinGAN数据增强的自动化DIP缺陷检测系统，YOLOv7+ConSinGAN组合在精度和检测时间上表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件缺陷检测耗时耗力，给质检人员带来沉重负担且难以管理产品质量，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用数字相机光学系统和深度学习模型，针对DIP的表面缺陷和引脚缺陷，采用ConSinGAN生成训练数据集，比较了YOLOv3/v4/v7/v9四种模型。

Result: YOLOv7+ConSinGAN组合达到95.50%的准确率和285ms检测时间，远优于阈值方法和其他YOLO版本。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动化缺陷检测系统可轻松应用于多种缺陷类型或缺陷数据不足的情况，并开发了SCADA系统和相关传感器架构。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundAD是一个基于基础视觉编码器的少样本异常检测方法，通过学习非线性投影算子来识别图像中的异常区域，在参数更少的情况下实现多类别检测的竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业安全检查中少样本异常检测面临样本有限、类别不可知条件下的准确区分挑战，而大规模预训练的基础视觉编码器能够学习正常图像的一般分布特征。

Method: 利用图像中异常数量与学习嵌入差异的相关性，设计非线性投影算子到自然图像流形上，作为识别图像中分布外区域的有效工具。

Result: 在多个基础编码器（包括DINOv3）上的广泛实验表明，该方法支持多类别检测，在参数显著少于先前方法的情况下实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法拓宽了基础特征的应用视角，推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

TL;DR: ClustViT通过可训练的聚类模块和再生器模块优化Vision Transformer，在语义分割任务中显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在真实世界机器人系统中应用受限，因为其二次注意力复杂度。现有token合并方法适合分类但不适合密集预测任务。

Method: 扩展ViT主干网络，引入可训练的聚类模块根据分割掩码的伪聚类合并相似token，然后通过再生器模块恢复细节用于下游头。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上实现高达2.18倍更少的GFLOPs和1.64倍更快的推理速度，同时保持可比较的分割精度。

Conclusion: ClustViT有效解决了ViT在密集预测任务中的计算效率问题，为实际机器人应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT是一种统一的多模态大语言模型范式，通过视觉参考令牌直接生成文本和视觉输出，解决了现有方法依赖间接表示的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉任务中依赖间接表示（如将坐标生成为文本），限制了性能并阻碍了密集预测任务如分割。

Method: 引入视觉参考令牌(VRTs)，从查询图像的视觉补丁嵌入中派生，与LLM输出文本令牌交织。使用轻量级解码器将LLM输出转换为检测、分割和定位预测。

Result: 在四个视觉感知和理解任务中，PaDT始终达到最先进的性能，甚至优于显著更大的MLLM模型。

Conclusion: PaDT为MLLMs提供了一种直接生成多样化视觉输出的统一范式，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: 本文提出TriAlignXA可解释AI框架解决农产品电商中的信任赤字问题，通过'三角信任指数'量化农产品分级中的'不可能三角'（生物特性、时效性、经济可行性），将算法角色从决策者转变为透明决策基础提供者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线果蔬电商存在'信任赤字'，因为数字交易无法提供产品质量的直接感官感知。传统绝对分级标准存在局限性，需要解决农产品分级中的'不可能三角'问题。

Method: 构建'信任金字塔'模型，提出'三角信任指数'(TTI)，设计TriAlignXA可解释AI框架，包含三个引擎：生物自适应引擎、时效优化引擎和经济优化引擎，以及'预映射机制'将过程数据编码为二维码。

Result: 分级任务实验显示比基线模型显著更高的准确率，实证证据和理论分析验证了框架在解决'不可能三角'方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可信赖的在线农产品生态系统提供了从理论到实践的全面支持，建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: 提出了4DGS-Craft框架，通过4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块和Gaussian选择机制，解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的视图、时间和非编辑区域一致性问题，并利用LLM模块理解用户意图，实现一致且交互式的4D场景编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯溅射编辑方法在视图一致性、时间一致性、非编辑区域一致性以及处理复杂文本指令方面存在挑战，需要开发一个更一致和交互式的编辑框架。

Method: 1. 引入4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型，集成4D VGGT几何特征；2. 使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入图像；3. 提出Gaussian选择机制仅优化编辑区域的高斯；4. 设计基于LLM的用户意图理解模块，分解复杂指令为原子操作序列。

Result: 相比相关工作，该方法实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，能够处理复杂的用户指令并保持编辑质量。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft框架通过结合4D感知编辑模型、一致性保持机制和用户意图理解，有效解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的关键挑战，为4D场景编辑提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Pure-Pass（PP）像素级掩码机制，用于图像超分辨率任务，通过识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，在保持自适应灵活性的同时实现细粒度、空间灵活的掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法如CAMixer虽然整合了多种方法的优势，但仍存在适应性差、掩码粒度粗和空间灵活性不足等局限性。

Method: 提出Pure-Pass像素级掩码机制，利用固定颜色中心点将像素分类到不同类别，实现细粒度的空间灵活掩码，并集成到ATD-light模型中。

Result: PP-ATD-light在重建质量和参数效率方面优于CAMixer-ATD-light，同时节省了相似的计算量。

Conclusion: Pure-Pass机制能够有效提升轻量级超分辨率模型的性能，在保持计算效率的同时实现更好的重建质量。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: 利用GPT-4o多模态能力自动生成颌骨囊肿影像发现，通过自校正循环框架(SLSO)提高准确性，相比传统CoT方法在多个评估项目上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高牙科全景X光片中颌骨囊肿发现的自动生成准确性，减少幻觉并改善结构化输出。

Method: 构建自校正循环结构化输出(SLSO)框架，包含10步流程：图像输入分析、结构化数据生成、牙号提取与一致性检查、检测到不一致时迭代再生、发现生成与后续重构和一致性验证。

Result: SLSO框架在牙号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收方面分别提高了66.9%、33.3%和28.6%的准确性，成功案例中最多经过5次再生实现一致结构化输出。

Conclusion: SLSO框架能强制阴性发现描述、抑制幻觉并提高牙号识别准确性，但识别跨多牙的广泛病变仍有限制，需要进一步改进以实现实用化发现生成系统。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Motivation: 开发仅依赖LiDAR点云的3D自编码器，在真实半自动驾驶车辆环境中实现高效特征编码，避免使用过多计算资源。

Method: 采用3D自编码器架构，减少编码器层数，简化跳跃连接，平衡跳跃连接信息和潜在编码，生成高效的潜在空间表示。

Result: 模型能够准确重建原始点云，在重建质量与性能之间取得有效平衡，并展现出良好的泛化能力，能重建与原始交通环境无关的物体。

Conclusion: LiLa-Net通过简化的架构设计实现了高效的3D点云特征编码和重建，在资源受限的环境中具有实用价值。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Motivation: 传统野外观察方法范围有限、耗时费力，难以评估跨景观的行为响应，需要可扩展的方法来量化复杂多维行为模式。

Method: 整合无人机视频与机器学习系统，通过目标检测、跟踪和行为分类生成时间预算、行为转换、社交互动、栖息地关联和群体组成动态等关键指标。

Conclusion: kabr-tools通过规模化自动行为监测，为生态系统研究、保护、生物多样性研究和生态监测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需标注数据的情况下，在整个变形过程中保持了局部细节和全局语义一致性。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Motivation: 现有基于条件扩散模型的方法泛化能力差，主要因为位置测量受用户体型影响大，无法跨用户通用。

Method: 将姿态估计建模为逆问题，使用预训练扩散模型仅以旋转测量为条件，通过似然项引导生成与测量位置一致的姿态。

Result: 提出的InPose方法能够生成与稀疏身体测量数据一致的高度可能姿态序列。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了零样本泛化，解决了现有方法因用户体型差异导致的泛化问题。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积架构如U-Net在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面能力有限，限制了在复杂肿瘤结构上的性能。扩散模型在生成高保真医学图像和优化分割边界方面显示出强大潜力。

Method: 在扩散过程核心嵌入视觉Transformer，利用全局上下文推理和迭代去噪来增强体积精度和边界精度。Transformer主干能够更有效地建模整个MRI体积的空间关系，而扩散细化则减轻体素级误差并恢复细粒度肿瘤细节。

Result: 在MRI脑肿瘤数据集上的实验验证显示，在Dice相似性和Hausdorff距离方面取得了一致的增益。

Conclusion: 这种混合设计为神经肿瘤学提供了改进鲁棒性和可扩展性的途径，超越了传统的U-Net基线，展示了Transformer引导的扩散模型在推进肿瘤分割技术前沿方面的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

*Woowon Jang,Jiwon Im,Juseung Choi,Niki Rashidian,Wesley De Neve,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点跟踪方法的失败模式，发现点跟踪在手术工具上表现良好，但在解剖目标上表现不佳，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2等视频对象分割模型在手术视频中具有零样本跟踪能力，但点跟踪在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败情况尚未充分了解，需要系统分析其失败模式。

Method: 在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中，针对胆囊、抓钳和L型电钩三个手术目标，比较点跟踪与分割掩码初始化的性能表现，并进行定性分析。

Result: 点跟踪在手术工具上表现具有竞争力，但在解剖目标上持续表现不佳，组织相似性和模糊边界是主要失败原因。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析揭示了影响跟踪结果的关键因素，并为选择和放置跟踪点提供了可操作建议，以改进手术视频分析性能。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FFREEDG新任务：在服务器预训练后，仅使用客户端未标注数据进行联邦学习，不重新访问源数据。提出FRIEREN框架，利用视觉基础模型整合视觉和语言模态，通过CLIP文本嵌入和弱到强一致性学习解决该任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在语义分割任务中面临领域偏移挑战，特别是当客户端数据未标注时。现有方法要么不切实际地假设客户端有标注数据，要么未能充分利用现代视觉基础模型的能力。

Method: FRIEREN框架：1）使用视觉-语言解码器，由CLIP文本嵌入指导以改善语义消歧；2）采用弱到强一致性学习策略，在伪标签上进行鲁棒的本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实和清晰到恶劣天气基准测试中，该框架有效解决了新任务，性能与现有领域泛化和适应方法相当，为未来研究设立了强基线。

Conclusion: 提出的FFREEDG任务和FRIEREN框架为联邦学习中的语义分割领域适应提供了新解决方案，展示了视觉基础模型在隐私保护场景下的潜力。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint是一个用于视频异常检测的结构化提示框架，通过动作中心知识引导冻结的视觉语言模型进行更准确和可解释的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法过于抽象，忽略了定义复杂异常所需的细粒度人-物交互或动作语义，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 将提示组织成语义连贯的组别（如暴力、财产犯罪、公共安全），并制定细粒度的引导问题，使模型预测与判别性视觉线索对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验显示，ASK-Hint持续提升AUC，相比现有基准方法达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架强调了提示粒度的重要性，为可解释的视频异常检测提供了一个无需训练且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过学生亲和网络利用3D自监督教师模型提取的几何先验来纯化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，有效解决了2D特征到3D语义分割中的噪声和几何不一致问题，仅需约1.5%的训练数据就能达到或超越最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将2D视觉语言模型特征迁移到3D语义分割时面临权衡：直接投影会产生噪声和碎片化预测，而强制几何一致性需要昂贵的训练流程和大规模标注3D数据。作者认为这种限制源于分割-匹配范式未能协调2D语义与3D几何结构。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法，使用小型学生亲和网络从3D自监督教师模型中提取几何先验来纯化2D VLM生成的3D点特征。在推理阶段设计了几何引导池化模块进一步去噪点云并确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试上的广泛实验表明，GeoPurify仅使用约1.5%的训练数据就能达到或超越最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在几何信息和学习的亲和网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征迁移中的权衡问题，实现了优越的数据效率。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于猪耳静脉模式的非侵入性生物识别方法，使用智能手机采集图像，通过多阶段计算机视觉流程提取特征，SVM模型在混合品种猪群中达到98.12%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猪只识别方法（如耳标和微芯片）不可靠、成本高且主要针对纯种猪，不适用于小规模养殖户，需要一种经济有效的非侵入性替代方案。

Method: 收集20头混合品种猪的800张耳部图像，使用标准智能手机和简单背光拍摄。开发多阶段计算机视觉流程增强静脉可见性，提取结构和空间特征生成生物特征签名，并用机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）达到最高准确率：在混合品种猪群中识别精度达98.12%。从图像处理到分类的整个过程平均耗时8.3秒，适合实时农场部署。

Conclusion: 通过用永久性生物标记替代易损坏的物理标识，该系统为农民提供了经济有效且无压力的动物识别方法，证实了耳静脉生物识别在数字化畜牧管理中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集和遮挡场景中，传统的基于检测的计数方法会失效，需要密度图估计方法来准确计数。特别是多类别场景下，需要解决类别间干扰问题。

Method: 采用Twins金字塔视觉transformer作为骨干网络，构建专门的多类别计数头，基于最先进的多尺度解码方法。添加基于分割的类别聚焦模块，在训练时抑制类别间串扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中表现优于先前的多类别人群计数方法（MAE分别降低33%、43%和64%），与YOLOv11的比较证明了在密集场景中人群计数方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过区域损失将多类别人群计数扩展到新领域，在生物多样性监测数据集上的应用展示了其支持保护工作和实现可扩展生态洞察的能力。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

TL;DR: TempoControl是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过优化交叉注意力图来实现视频生成中的时间对齐控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成视频模型缺乏细粒度的时间控制能力，无法让用户指定特定视觉元素在生成序列中出现的时间。

Method: 利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过相关性、能量和熵三个互补原则来引导概念的时间安排。

Result: TempoControl能够实现精确的时间控制，同时保持高质量和多样性的视频生成，适用于时间重排序、动作和音频对齐等多种应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成视频模型提供了有效的时间控制能力，无需重新训练即可实现细粒度的时间对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RewardMap框架，通过密集奖励信号和多阶段强化学习解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理任务中的稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了空间推理和视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在结构化信息丰富的环境（如交通地图）中进行细粒度视觉推理时表现不佳，而标准强化学习由于稀疏奖励和优化不稳定而受阻。

Method: 构建了ReasonMap-Plus数据集提供密集奖励信号，提出了RewardMap多阶段强化学习框架，包含难度感知奖励设计和从简单感知到复杂推理的多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus上的实验表明，RewardMap各组件均带来性能提升，组合使用时效果最佳。在6个基准测试中平均提升3.47%，涵盖空间推理、细粒度视觉推理和通用任务。

Conclusion: RewardMap框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理中的稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了模型的视觉理解和推理能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

*Zihan Zhou,Shilin Lu,Shuli Leng,Shaocong Zhang,Zhuming Lian,Xinlei Yu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow是首个有效利用FLUX强大先验进行拖拽式图像编辑的框架，通过区域化编辑范式和仿射变换解决了DiT特征结构化不足的问题，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型从UNet-based DDPMs转向更可扩展的DiT with flow matching，生成先验显著增强，但拖拽式编辑尚未从中受益。现有方法在目标区域存在扭曲问题，因为早期基础模型的先验不足以将优化后的潜在表示投影回自然图像流形。

Method: 提出区域化编辑范式，使用仿射变换实现更丰富一致的特征监督；集成预训练的开域个性化适配器增强主体一致性；通过基于梯度掩码的硬约束保持背景保真度；使用多模态大语言模型解决任务歧义。

Result: 在DragBench-DR和ReD Bench上的广泛实验表明，DragFlow超越了基于点和基于区域的基线方法，在拖拽式图像编辑中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DragFlow成功利用FLUX的丰富先验进行拖拽式编辑，通过区域化方法克服了DiT特征结构化不足的局限性，为拖拽式图像编辑设定了新的技术标准。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出F2C方法，通过选择关键片段而非单帧来保持视频时序连贯性，采用自适应分辨率策略在固定计算预算下平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，显著提升长视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型面临"大海捞针"问题：原始视频帧产生的大量视觉标记耗尽模型上下文窗口。现有解决方案通过选择稀疏帧集来减少标记数量，但这种逐帧选择丢弃了关键的时序动态信息，导致对运动和事件连续性的推理效果不佳。

Method: 提出F2C方法：1）将选择范围从孤立关键帧扩展到关键片段（短而时序连贯的片段）；2）采用自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，确保每个视频的标记数量恒定；3）无需训练即可应用。

Result: 在三个长视频基准测试上，F2C方法相比均匀采样分别提升了8.1%（Video-MME）、5.6%（LongVideoBench）和10.3%（MLVU）。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明保持时序连贯性在帧选择中的重要性，为将视频大语言模型扩展到现实世界视频理解应用提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习和可穿戴传感器的进步为在专业实验室外捕获和分析人体运动提供了新机会，准确评估真实条件下的人体运动对远程医疗、运动科学和康复至关重要。

Result: MotionAGFormer表现最优，总体RMSE(9.27°±4.80°)、MAE(7.86°±4.18°)最低，Pearson相关性(0.86±0.15)和决定系数R²(0.67±0.28)最高。两种技术都适用于实验室外运动学评估。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了现成视频模型在健康成年人中提供临床有前景的运动学数据的情况，以及与IMU估计相比的差距，为研究人员和临床医生开发稳健、经济高效且用户友好的远程医疗解决方案提供了宝贵指南。

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Motivation: 解决从脑活动重建视觉信息时面临的跨被试差异大、计算成本高的问题，以及大脑对复杂视觉输入的抽象语义编码挑战。

Method: 集成互补适配器的扩散模型：AutoKL处理低级特征，CLIP处理语义特征；CLIP适配器在Stable Diffusion生成图像上训练；跨被试时仅微调17%参数（全连接层）。

Result: 在轻量级GPU（3个RTX 4090）上每个被试仅需1小时训练，即达到最先进性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NeuroSwift通过高效的参数微调策略和互补特征提取，成功解决了跨被试视觉重建的计算挑战和性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: microCLIP是一个自训练框架，通过细粒度线索联合优化CLIP的视觉和文本表示，在13个细粒度基准测试中平均准确率提升2.90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型依赖粗粒度全局特征，在细粒度图像分类任务中表现受限，需要提升对微观局部线索的敏感性。

Method: 提出Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)构建显著性引导的[FG]token，与全局[CLS]token融合；使用双头LLM派生分类器进行稳定适应；开发动态知识聚合迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 在13个细粒度基准测试中平均准确率提升2.90%，仅需轻量级适应。

Conclusion: microCLIP能够有效挖掘CLIP中的潜在细粒度信号，显著提升细粒度分类性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频快速发展，需要有效的检测工具来减轻错误信息和声誉损害等社会风险，同时检测模型需要提供可解释的说明以确保透明度

Method: 使用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)微调多模态大语言模型，构建包含14万真实和AI生成视频的挑战性数据集，设计专门针对时间伪影和生成复杂度的奖励模型

Result: 在现有基准测试中实现最先进的零样本性能，额外训练后准确率超过95%，案例研究显示能产生精确且可解释的预测理由

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1在视频真实性检测方面表现出色，既能提供高精度分类，又能生成可解释的推理过程，为监管机构和终端用户提供透明度

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和视频生成方面取得了革命性进展，但基于transformer架构的计算成本过高，特别是在生成长视频时。现有自回归方法在超出训练范围时会出现明显的质量退化问题。

Method: 利用教师模型的丰富知识，通过从自生成长视频中采样的片段为学生模型提供指导，保持时间一致性，避免过曝光和错误累积问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需额外监督或重新训练，在标准基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

TL;DR: KineMask是一种基于物理引导的视频生成方法，通过两阶段训练策略和物体掩码，实现了对刚体运动的真实控制和物体交互，在合成和真实场景中都显著提升了物体交互的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物理可信的物体交互方面存在不足，缺乏基于物理的控制机制。为了解决这一限制，作者希望开发能够实现真实刚体控制、交互和效果的物理引导视频生成方法。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略，通过物体掩码逐步移除未来运动监督，在合成场景上训练视频扩散模型。结合低级运动控制（指定物体速度）和高级文本条件（预测性场景描述）来支持复杂动态现象的合成。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中都显著改善了物体交互质量，相比同类规模的近期模型取得了显著提升。消融研究进一步验证了低级和高级条件在视频扩散模型中的互补作用。

Conclusion: KineMask通过物理引导的视频生成方法，成功实现了对刚体运动的真实控制和物体交互，为机器人学和具身决策提供了有前景的世界模拟器。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Motivation: 解决多模态语言模型在视频理解中因上下文长度限制而错过关键过渡帧、难以保持长时间连贯性的问题。

Method: 将原生稀疏注意力(NSA)适配到视频语言模型中，采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法：文本使用密集注意力，视频使用NSA，并在216K视频指令数据集上进行端到端训练。

Result: 在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试中表现优于基线方法，能够可靠扩展到128K tokens，发现了最优的全局-局部注意力分配比例。

Conclusion: VideoNSA通过可学习的组合稀疏注意力成功诱导动态注意力汇聚点，为长视频理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

TL;DR: NoiseShift是一种无需训练的方法，通过重新校准去噪器的噪声水平来解决扩散模型在不同分辨率下的泛化问题，显著提升低分辨率图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高分辨率文本到图像生成器无法为不需要高分辨率图像的用户提供经济高效的解决方案，因为模型在固定分辨率训练后难以泛化到其他分辨率，特别是低分辨率。

Method: 提出NoiseShift方法，基于分辨率大小重新校准去噪器的噪声水平，无需改变模型架构或采样计划，与现有模型兼容。

Result: 在LAION-COCO数据集上，NoiseShift将SD3.5的FID提升15.89%，SD3提升8.56%，Flux-Dev提升2.44%；在CelebA数据集上，分别提升10.36%、5.19%和3.02%。

Conclusion: NoiseShift有效缓解了分辨率相关的伪影，显著提高了低分辨率图像生成质量，为解决扩散模型分辨率泛化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

Motivation: 研究从视频中推断需要时间信息才能判断的动态物理属性，如弹性、粘度和动态摩擦，这些属性对人类视觉系统来说相对容易感知，但对计算机视觉系统具有挑战性。

Method: 收集了三个物理属性的新视频数据集（合成训练测试集和真实世界评估集）；探索了三种推断方法：基于经典计算机视觉的oracle方法、使用视觉提示和可训练提示向量的简单读取机制、多模态大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 在生成或自监督方式下训练的视频基础模型表现相似，但落后于oracle方法；多模态大语言模型目前表现较差，但通过合适的提示可以改善性能。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在预测动态物理属性方面显示出潜力，但仍有改进空间；多模态大语言模型需要更好的提示策略来提升性能。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV

Conclusion: 提出的自适应膨胀MPC-CBF策略在保证安全的同时减少了保守性，实现了自主船舶在狭窄水道中的实时导航。

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world
systems.

TL;DR: VENTURA是一个视觉语言导航系统，通过微调互联网预训练的扩散模型进行路径规划，生成视觉路径掩码，再由轻量级策略执行，在真实世界评估中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人需要适应多样化人类指令并在非结构化环境中安全操作的问题，同时克服现有视觉语言模型在机器人导航任务中由于动作空间差异和预训练目标不同导致的迁移困难。

Method: 使用互联网预训练的扩散模型进行微调，生成图像空间中的路径掩码作为视觉规划，然后通过轻量级的行为克隆策略将这些视觉规划转化为可执行轨迹。

Result: 在真实世界评估中，VENTURA在物体到达、障碍物避让和地形偏好任务上优于最先进的基线方法，成功率提高33%，碰撞率降低54%，并能泛化到未见过的任务组合。

Conclusion: VENTURA展示了通过视觉路径规划和轻量级策略执行的组合方法，在机器人导航任务中实现了显著的性能提升和组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: INSIGHT是一个利用token级不确定性信号来预测VLA模型何时需要请求帮助的学习框架，通过提取熵、对数概率和不确定性估计，训练transformer分类器来触发求助机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型缺乏内省机制来预测失败并请求人类监督，需要开发能够主动识别不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用π₀-FAST作为基础模型，提取token级的不确定性信号（熵、对数概率、偶然和认知不确定性），训练紧凑的transformer分类器来映射这些序列到求助触发。

Result: 强监督标签能捕捉细粒度不确定性动态实现可靠的求助检测，弱监督标签虽然噪声较大但在训练和评估一致时仍具竞争力。建模token级不确定性信号的时间演化比静态序列级分数具有更强的预测能力。

Conclusion: 这是VLA中基于不确定性的内省机制的首个系统评估，为主动学习和通过选择性人类干预实现实时错误缓解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static
sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of
uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active
learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human
intervention.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出动态抛物线控制屏障函数(DPCBF)来解决非完整机器人在密集动态环境中CBF方法保守性过高和QP不可行的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于碰撞锥或速度障碍的CBF方法仅考虑相对速度角度，在密集场景中过于保守且容易导致QP不可行

Method: 使用抛物线边界定义安全集，抛物线的顶点和曲率根据障碍物距离和相对速度大小动态调整，创建限制更少的安全约束

Result: DPCBF控制器显著提高了导航成功率和QP可行性，在100个动态障碍物的密集环境中成功导航，而基于碰撞锥的方法因不可行性而失败

Conclusion: DPCBF为密集动态环境中的非完整机器人提供了一种有效的安全控制方法，显著优于现有方法

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

TL;DR: 研究扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中学习运动学约束的能力，通过双手抓取任务分析数据集大小、质量和流形曲率对约束学习的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中表现出色，但仅凭任务性能不能可靠评估策略学习训练数据中约束的能力，需要研究扩散策略如何准确发现约束流形

Method: 通过双手抓取放置任务的案例研究，分析三个因素对训练策略的影响：数据集大小、数据集质量和流形曲率

Result: 扩散策略学习到约束流形的粗略近似，数据集大小和质量的下降对学习产生负面影响，而流形曲率与约束满足和任务成功的关系不明确

Conclusion: 硬件评估验证了研究结果在现实世界中的适用性，扩散策略能够学习运动学约束但受数据集特性影响

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

TL;DR: AFFORD2ACT是一个基于视觉的机器人学习框架，通过文本提示和单张图像提取语义2D关键点，构建紧凑的38维状态策略，在15分钟内完成训练，在多样化真实世界操作任务中实现82%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的机器人学习方法依赖密集图像或点云输入，计算量大且包含无关背景特征。基于关键点的方法虽然轻量但依赖手动启发式或任务耦合选择，限制了可扩展性和语义理解。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 可操作性过滤；2) 类别级关键点构建；3) 基于transformer的策略学习，使用嵌入式门控机制推理最相关的关键点。

Result: 在未见过的物体、新类别、背景和干扰物上实现82%的成功率，显著提高数据效率，无需本体感知或密集表示即可实时运行。

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT通过语义关键点提取和门控机制，实现了高效、轻量且可扩展的机器人操作学习，在真实世界任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

Abstract: Robotic automation is accelerating scientific discovery by reducing manual
effort in laboratory workflows. However, precise manipulation of powders
remains challenging, particularly in tasks such as transport that demand
accuracy and stability. We propose a trajectory optimisation framework for
powder transport in laboratory settings, which integrates differentiable
physics simulation for accurate modelling of granular dynamics, low-dimensional
skill-space parameterisation to reduce optimisation complexity, and a
curriculum-based strategy that progressively refines task competence over long
horizons. This formulation enables end-to-end optimisation of contact-rich
robot trajectories while maintaining stability and convergence efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
task success rates and stability compared to the reinforcement learning
baseline.

TL;DR: 开发了一种用于乳腺癌保乳手术的协作机器人引导系统，通过触觉反馈帮助定位肿瘤边界，在模拟实验中证明能改善切除边缘并降低手术难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌保乳手术中，肿瘤边界定位困难，因为肿瘤通常高度移动、无法触及且形状不规则，需要更精确的定位方法。

Method: 将小型触觉机器人改装为电灼刀，结合超声和电磁导航识别肿瘤边界，当手术工具碰撞肿瘤边界时施加禁止区域虚拟夹具，进行有无触觉引导的模拟切除对比研究。

Result: 虚拟夹具引导改善了切除边缘，用户在使用触觉反馈时感觉任务更轻松、精神负担更小、挫败感更低，但也发现了一些对手术流程的意外影响。

Conclusion: 虚拟夹具能在模拟保乳手术中帮助定位肿瘤边界，未来将进行更广泛的用户研究来验证结果并优化引导系统。

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在机器人导航中存在三个基本限制：缺乏持久场景记忆、空间推理能力有限、无法有效扩展视频时长以支持实时应用。

Method: 将视频序列分块处理，利用现代视觉语言模型构建持久知识图谱，通过可查询的图结构实现可解释的空间推理。

Conclusion: VL-KnG系统在保持计算效率的同时，为实时部署提供了可解释的空间推理能力，适用于定位、导航和规划等不同任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but
encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer
limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for
real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system
that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction
and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal
identification. Our approach processes video sequences in chunks utilizing
modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity
over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph
structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200
manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a
differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method
achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5

Motivation: 研究旨在解决自由漂浮、关节未驱动的仿生多连杆机器人在仅有最小感知能力（每个连杆单个陀螺仪）情况下的位姿估计问题，这类平台具有欠驱动和感知受限的特点。

Method: 采用无迹卡尔曼滤波并增强高斯过程残差学习来补偿非零均值、非高斯噪声，通过概念验证硬件实验和离线卡尔曼滤波分析进行验证。

Conclusion: 步态输入空间存在重叠，可利用这一特性减少训练数据需求，同时增强滤波器在多种步态间的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

Conclusion: 该分层框架有效克服神经场方法的常见缺陷，为复杂环境机器人导航提供平滑精确的成本场表示

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time multi-plane segmentation method based on
GPU-accelerated high-resolution 3D voxel mapping for legged robot locomotion.
Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and
computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors
suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.

*Seungwon Choi,Donggyu Park,Seo-Yeon Hwang,Tae-Wan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线学习测量可靠性的统计框架，通过多视角几何一致性作为自监督，动态评估视觉惯性里程计中传感器测量的可靠性，相比固定不确定性参数的方法，在EuRoC数据集上平均减少了24%的平移误差和42%的旋转误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设所有测量具有静态、均匀的不确定性，无法捕捉真实世界数据中的动态误差特性，限制了鲁棒视觉惯性里程计的性能。

Method: 利用多视角几何一致性作为自监督，直接从传感器数据和优化结果中在线学习测量可靠性评估，推断地标不确定性并在优化过程中自适应加权视觉测量。

Result: 在EuRoC数据集上评估，相比固定不确定性参数的基线方法，平均减少24%的平移误差和42%的旋转误差，框架能够实时运行并展现出更高的精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的统计框架能够有效改善视觉惯性里程计的鲁棒性，通过在线学习测量可靠性实现更准确的状态估计，源代码将公开以促进可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: SymSkill是一个统一的学习框架，结合模仿学习和任务运动规划的优势，实现组合泛化和实时故障恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态环境中多步操作的挑战：模仿学习缺乏组合泛化能力，而任务运动规划则存在规划延迟问题。

Method: 从无标签、无分割的演示中联合学习谓词、操作符和技能，使用符号规划器组合和重排序技能，在运动和符号层面进行实时恢复。

Result: 在RoboCasa模拟中执行12个单步任务成功率85%，无需额外数据即可组合成最多6次技能重组的复杂计划；在真实机器人上从5分钟无标签数据学习后能执行多任务。

Conclusion: SymSkill框架能够实现安全、不间断的执行，在人类和环境干扰下具有鲁棒性，为动态环境中的多步操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何反步控制器，用于可变倾角全向多旋翼飞行器，明确考虑了伺服和转子动力学，在激进飞行和扰动恢复中表现优于不考虑执行器动力学的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有执行器感知控制方法依赖于执行器输入与力矩之间的线性关系，无法捕捉可变倾角引起的非线性效应，需要开发能够处理这些非线性特性的控制器。

Method: 利用多旋翼刚体动力学与非线性执行器动力学之间的级联结构，设计几何反步控制器，并建立整个系统的指数稳定性。

Result: 在快速平移跟踪、快速旋转跟踪和突然扰动恢复三个实验场景中，所提方法始终获得更好的跟踪性能，而基线方法在最快平移轨迹跟踪和恢复实验中发散并坠毁。

Conclusion: 所提出的控制器能够有效处理执行器非线性动力学，对参数不确定性具有鲁棒性，在激进飞行和扰动恢复场景中保持稳定性和任务完成能力。

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: PolySim是一个多仿真器训练平台，通过同时使用多个异构仿真器训练人形机器人全身控制策略，减少仿真器归纳偏差，实现零样本从仿真到真实世界的部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仿真到真实世界的差距问题，这种差距源于单个仿真器的归纳偏差（固有的假设和限制），导致跨仿真器和仿真到真实世界之间的显著差异。

Method: 开发PolySim平台，在单个训练运行中同时启动来自不同引擎的并行环境，实现动态层面的领域随机化，联合训练策略以捕捉超越任何单个仿真器假设的通用动力学。

Result: 在仿真到仿真评估中显著减少运动跟踪误差，在MuJoCo上比IsaacSim基线提高执行成功率52.8%；能够零样本部署到真实Unitree G1机器人上，无需额外微调。

Conclusion: PolySim通过多仿真器训练有效缓解仿真器归纳偏差，提供更紧的上界，成功实现从仿真到真实世界的有效迁移。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

TL;DR: 提出Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL)，一种简单有效的表示正则化方法，用于改进视觉-语言-动作模型的表示质量，使其对机器人信号更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型虽然利用预训练视觉语言模型的丰富表示，但这些表示对机器人信号（如控制动作和本体感知状态）不够敏感，导致在机器人操作任务中表现欠佳。

Method: 引入RS-CL损失函数，使用机器人本体感知状态之间的相对距离作为软监督信号，将表示与机器人状态更紧密地对齐，同时保持与标准VLA训练流程的兼容性。

Result: 在RoboCasa-Kitchen的拾放任务中，将成功率从30.8%提升至41.5%；在真实机器人操作任务中，成功率从45.0%提升至58.3%。

Conclusion: RS-CL通过增强控制相关的表示学习，显著提升了VLA模型在机器人操作任务中的性能，证明了将机器人状态信息融入表示学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有轴向磁化的磁性连续体机器人主要限于弯曲运动，需要扩展变形能力以实现更复杂的医疗操作。

Method: 在导管壁内径向嵌入永磁体，通过外部永磁体独立诱导弯曲或扭转；采用基于物理的建模和有限元分析；设计双层阻塞机制（外槽和内板）利用扭转剪切实现药物释放。

Conclusion: 该紧凑、无缆平台结合了多功能变形与精确有效载荷递送，显示出在下一代定点治疗中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by
twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform
combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong
potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

Method: 开发了基于交通系统的随时循环嵌入求解器（TS-ACES），这是一种完整的求解方法。

Result: TS-ACES能够扩展到基于真实工业场景的SFE实例，处理超过100台机器的情况。

Conclusion: TS-ACES填补了SFE问题可扩展性方面的空白，是首个能够处理大规模智能工厂嵌入的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

TL;DR: Nav-EE是一个导航引导的早期退出框架，通过利用自动驾驶导航系统的先验知识，预计算任务特定的退出层，在保持准确性的同时显著降低视觉语言模型的推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中应用广泛，但高推理延迟阻碍实时部署。传统早期退出方法受限于任务依赖性，难以适应多样化场景。

Method: 基于导航系统可预测即将到来的场景（如交叉口、交通灯），预先计算任务特定的退出层，在线时根据导航先验动态应用这些退出层。

Result: 在CODA、Waymo和BOSCH数据集上，Nav-EE在保持与完整推理相当的准确性的同时，将延迟降低高达63.9%。真实车辆集成显示推理延迟从600ms降至300ms。

Conclusion: 将导航预见性与早期退出相结合，为在自动驾驶系统中高效部署大型模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight
with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large
models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous
repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Nav-EE-BBC4

Motivation: ObjectNav是移动机器人在日常环境中部署的关键组件，但当前缺乏对RL系统中各组件贡献的统一分析。本文旨在确定哪些组件真正驱动性能，为未来ObjectNav发展提供指导。

Method: 将模块化RL-based ObjectNav系统分解为三个关键组件：感知、策略和测试时增强，通过大量受控实验隔离每个组件的贡献。

Result: 感知质量和测试时策略是性能的决定性驱动因素，策略改进仅带来边际增益。提出的增强模块化系统在SPL上超越SOTA方法6.6%，成功率提升2.7%。人类专家在相同条件下达到98%成功率。

Conclusion: 感知和测试时策略是ObjectNav性能的关键，当前RL代理与人类导航能力存在显著差距。研究为未来ObjectNav开发和评估提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了双足机器人踢球任务中的轨迹规划问题，实现了高效可靠的踢球动作，为机器人足球应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future

Conclusion: TACOS提供了一个统一的框架，通过大语言模型实现多无人机系统的高级自然语言控制，有效减少了飞行员的工作负担。

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

Result: 实验验证了线性力-位移特性，水平刚度范围为300-700 N/m，相对误差≤1.5%；动态测试确认了质量-弹簧-阻尼器响应。

Conclusion: SPARC为腿式运动中的脊柱柔顺性研究提供了系统平台，并将发布完整的硬件和固件资源。

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型预测控制的运动提示算法，通过惩罚感官冲突和比力误差来联合优化驾驶模拟器的保真度和舒适度，显著降低了晕动症。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶模拟器在研发中应用日益广泛，但常因缩小运动和未缩放视觉导致晕动症。需要开发能同时优化保真度和舒适度的运动提示算法。

Method: 使用模型预测控制开发运动提示算法，在成本函数中同时惩罚感官冲突和比力误差。进行了人机回路实验，比较四种运动设置：两种MPC算法变体、自适应洗出和无运动情况。

Result: 实验结果显示，折衷解决方案相比自适应洗出和纯比力跟踪算法，将晕动症降低了50%以上（平均MISC水平从3降至1.5），且保真度评级没有显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的方法考虑了模拟器动力学和晕动症时间演化，在实现晕动症控制和比力重现最优平衡方面取得了显著进展，支持模拟器的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development.
However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and
unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

*Lingxiang Hu,Naima Ait Oufroukh,Fabien Bonardi,Raymond Ghandour*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EC3R-SLAM是一个无需相机标定的单目稠密SLAM框架，通过结合稀疏特征点跟踪和前馈3D重建模型，实现了高精度定位与建图、低延迟和低GPU内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目稠密SLAM方法存在高延迟、大GPU内存消耗和依赖相机标定的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合跟踪模块（维护稀疏特征点地图）和基于前馈3D重建模型的建图模块，同时估计相机内参，并融入局部和全局闭环检测。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到与最先进方法相当的性能，同时更快、更节省内存，能在笔记本电脑和Jetson Orin NX等资源受限平台上有效运行。

Conclusion: EC3R-SLAM展示了在真实世界机器人应用中实现高效、鲁棒SLAM的潜力。

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics
applications.

Conclusion: 该框架通过语言交互和精细感知能力，有效解决了机器人抓取中的模糊指令问题，为复杂环境下的机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

Conclusion: 解决关节位置误差是提高机器人站起成功率的有效方法，该方法已被多个团队验证有效

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,
electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing
the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These
capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory
modality for soft robots. The complete parts list, assembly guidelines, and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出使用数字孪生技术优化电动汽车电池的拆解过程，通过扩展产品-过程-资源资产网络(PAN)为双向PAN(Bi-PAN)来同时支持制造和再制造/回收阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在循环经济背景下，制造商往往不共享相关数据，导致产品生命周期末端的再制造和回收过程缺乏足够支持，影响可持续性和环境保护。

Method: 采用数字孪生技术，基于产品-过程-资源资产网络(PAN)范式，提出双向PAN(Bi-PAN)表示方法，能够同时建模制造和再制造/回收阶段的相关关系。

Result: 通过电动汽车电池拆解用例证明，产品数字孪生能够灵活高效地解决不同类型电池的拆解挑战，减少生态影响并提升可持续性。

Conclusion: 双向PAN扩展了传统PAN范式，为产品生命周期管理提供了更全面的数字孪生表示方法，有效支持循环经济中的再制造和回收过程。

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因固定数据集而泛化能力差，现有LLM和VLM方法虽然语义丰富但缺乏鲁棒灵活的精炼机制，导致布局质量不佳。

Method: 开发了语义精炼工具(SRT)修正抽象对象关系，物理精炼工具(PRT)通过网格匹配算法解决具体空间问题，并采用多智能体框架协调这些工具。

Result: 实验证明DisCo-Layout达到了最先进的性能，能够生成逼真、连贯且可泛化的3D室内布局。

Conclusion: DisCo-Layout通过解耦物理和语义精炼，结合多智能体协作，有效解决了3D室内布局合成的泛化和精炼问题。

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了FalconGym 2.0仿真框架和性能引导精炼(PGR)算法，通过高斯溅射技术和可编程轨道生成，训练出能泛化到多种几何形状轨道的视觉策略，并在真实四旋翼上实现零样本迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉策略在无人机导航中容易对单一轨道过拟合，当轨道几何形状变化时性能会下降，需要开发能泛化到多样化轨道的视觉策略。

Method: 开发了基于高斯溅射(GSplat)的FalconGym 2.0仿真框架，提供编辑API快速生成多样化静态和动态轨道；提出性能引导精炼(PGR)算法，在具有挑战性的轨道上集中训练视觉策略。

Result: 在两个案例研究(固定翼无人机和四旋翼)中，使用PGR训练的单一视觉策略在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法：在三个未见轨道上实现100%成功率，无需逐轨道重新训练；在门位姿扰动下保持更高成功率；在真实四旋翼上实现零样本迁移，在30次试验中达到98.6%成功率。

Conclusion: FalconGym 2.0结合PGR算法能够训练出具有强泛化能力的视觉策略，成功实现从仿真到真实环境的零样本迁移，为无人机视觉导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了运动重定向质量对策略性能的影响，提出了一种新的重定向方法GMR，在减少奖励工程的情况下显著提升了运动跟踪的鲁棒性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人运动跟踪中的人体-机器人体现差距问题，现有重定向方法引入的伪影（如脚滑动、自穿透等）会降低策略性能，需要大量奖励工程来弥补。

Method: 提出通用运动重定向(GMR)方法，与现有开源重定向器PHC、ProtoMotions以及Unitree的闭源数据集进行比较，使用BeyondMimic进行策略训练以隔离重定向效果。

Result: GMR在跟踪性能和运动保真度方面一致优于现有开源方法，在感知保真度和策略成功率上接近闭源基准水平，特别是在动态或长序列运动中表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 重定向质量对策略性能至关重要，GMR方法能有效减少重定向伪影，在减少奖励工程的情况下实现更好的运动跟踪效果。

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过显式将策略与相机外参条件化来实现视角不变模仿学习，发现这种方法能显著提升行为克隆策略在不同视角下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模仿学习策略在视角变化时性能下降的问题，特别是当策略依赖静态背景线索推断相机姿态时，这种捷径会在工作空间几何或相机位置变化时失效。

Method: 使用Plucker嵌入表示像素射线，将相机外参作为条件输入到策略中，包括ACT、Diffusion Policy和SmolVLA等标准行为克隆策略。在RoboSuite和ManiSkill中设计了6个操作任务，包含固定和随机化场景变体。

Result: 实验表明，不包含外参的策略在固定场景中会利用静态背景线索推断相机姿态，但当工作空间几何或相机放置变化时性能崩溃。而包含外参条件化的策略恢复了性能，实现了仅使用RGB的鲁棒控制。

Conclusion: 显式条件化相机外参是实现视角不变模仿学习的有效方法，能够提高策略在不同视角下的鲁棒性，无需深度信息即可实现可靠的RGB控制。

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

Motivation: 模仿学习虽然能从大规模真实世界数据中学习，但预训练策略在缺乏领域内数据时表现不佳，且人工收集演示数据成本高、质量参差不齐。现有的人机协作系统需要全程人工监督，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 提出ARMADA系统，采用人机协作共享控制，并开发FLOAT自主在线故障检测方法，实现并行策略部署和按需人工干预。

Result: 在四个真实世界任务中，FLOAT平均准确率达到近95%，比现有最佳故障检测方法提升超过20%。ARMADA相比前人机协作学习方法，成功率提高4倍以上，人工干预率降低2倍以上。

Conclusion: ARMADA通过高效的领域内数据获取和快速适应新场景，实现了更可扩展的部署和更快的适应能力，显著减少了人类监督需求。

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

Motivation: 温度采样虽然能增加语言模型输出的多样性，但在需要高精度的任务（如数学推理）中会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样到错误延续。

Method: 选择性采样：基于采样风险指标动态切换贪婪和高温度采样。训练轻量级分类器预测采样风险，可集成到基础语言模型中且延迟开销最小。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性的权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高精度任务中温度采样导致的质量下降问题，实现了更好的多样性和准确性平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,

50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

### [122] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个新颖的向量量化框架，通过几何驱动创新解决大语言模型极低位量化中的方向误差和位分配问题，在2位量化中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法面临无约束方向误差和次优位分配两个关键问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个几何驱动创新：1）误差方向敏感度引导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感方向；2）权重通道敏感度引导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导位资源分配。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B的2位量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度(PPL)上领先基线方法0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过多信号证据集成和序列决策来抵御投毒和后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要有效的防御机制。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知深度Q网络集成多信号证据并优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上验证了方法的有效性：准确率稳步提升，客户端重叠增加可提高准确率并降低攻击成功率，序列信念更新可缓解弱信号问题。

Conclusion: 深度Q网络在与其他控制器（随机、线性Q、策略梯度）的比较中实现了最佳的鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Motivation: 准确的列车延误预测对铁路运营效率至关重要，现有方法主要关注单个列车的精确延误预测，需要支持更高级别交通管理的车站级延误预测。

Result: 在印度铁路网络4735个车站的大规模数据集上实验，相比现有方法在标准指标上取得一致改进。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过局部流量预算（活跃度×扇出）来平衡选择性和传播范围，提高编码熵和解相关性，在多种网络架构中提升准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于损失影响（如权重大小或梯度）来移除参数，但缺乏对网络表示多样性和效率的系统性考虑

Method: 为每个单元分配局部流量预算（活跃度a_i×扇出k_i），通过约束熵分析得到选择性-传播平衡关系，使用简单的局部执行器剪枝扇入（降低活跃度）或扇出（减少传播）

Result: 在ASR Transformer、人脸识别ResNet和突触预测3D U-Net中，BB提高了编码熵和解相关性，在相同稀疏度下提升了准确率，有时甚至超过密集基线；在电子显微镜图像上达到最先进的F1和PR-AUC

Conclusion: BB易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive

scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios

morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high

TL;DR: RLP是一种信息驱动的强化预训练目标，将强化学习的探索精神引入预训练最后阶段，通过奖励思维链提供的信息增益来训练模型独立思考


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式只在最后阶段使用强化学习，但这是否最优？作者希望将强化学习的核心精神——探索——更早地引入预训练过程

Method: 将思维链视为探索性动作，基于思维链为预测未来token提供的信息增益计算奖励信号，形成无需验证器的密集奖励机制

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上，RLP预训练将8个数学科学基准平均提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上，总体平均从42.81%提升至61.32%，科学推理提升23%

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新定义为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个token预测与有用思维链推理之间的差距，在不同架构和模型规模上都表现出良好的可扩展性

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，解决了RL控制器在训练阶段可能对结构造成损害的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的LQR控制需要精确的系统识别，而纯RL方法在训练阶段缺乏先验知识，可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制效果好。

Method: 开发了LQR和RL的混合控制框架，LQR策略基于随机选择的模型和参数，不依赖真实或近似结构模型，整个框架保持无模型特性。

Result: 该方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制关键训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Motivation: 理解RNN内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的方法来识别信息传输的关键节点。

Method: 使用互信息量化输入输出向量在节点间的信息传递，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU架构。

Result: 发现不同架构中存在明显的信息中继模式，揭示了信息随时间处理和维持的方式，节点敲除实验验证了识别节点的功能重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅加深了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

Result: 在多个数据集上显著超越现有PU方法，包括灾害后建筑损毁映射等实际应用场景

Conclusion: NcPU框架有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈，为实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过扰动引发潜在信号来指示模型错误

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测各种错误行为，包括事实性、安全性、毒性和后门攻击，且计算效率高

Conclusion: 预训练LLM已编码了标记自身错误的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了途径

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思维自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-驱逐策略和高效内存管理，在保持接近无损精度的同时将KV缓存减少到原始大小的5%以下，推理吞吐量提升高达5.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成虽然支持扩展思维链，但也导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性识别不同重要性的思维类型，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，按思维重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演化逐步驱逐不太重要的思维token。设计了扩展PagedAttention的内核，实现被驱逐token内存槽的高效重用。

Conclusion: ThinKV有效解决了大型推理模型KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Motivation: 传统分析通常假设训练数据和参数是各向同性和独立的，但在实际应用中这些假设往往不成立。本文旨在理解在更一般的数据模型下神经网络梯度的结构特性。

Method: 采用尖峰数据模型，允许数据体部分各向异性和病态，不要求数据和权重矩阵独立，同时分析了均值场和神经正切核两种缩放机制。

Result: 输入权重梯度近似低秩，由两个秩一成分主导：一个与数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一尖峰对齐。训练数据特性、缩放机制和激活函数共同调节这两个成分的平衡。

Conclusion: 标准正则化方法（如权重衰减、输入噪声和雅可比惩罚）能够选择性地调节梯度中的不同成分。理论预测在合成和真实数据实验中得到了验证。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

### [136] [Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335)
*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，测试显示现有IDE方法在该基准上表现较差，表明基准难度较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内在维度估计方法在真实数据集上表现差异很大，需要更复杂的流形基准来评估这些方法。

Method: 基于量子光学方法构建无限族拓扑非平凡流形基准QuIIEst，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，并在分形Hofstadter蝴蝶上进行IDE测试。

Result: 在QuIIEst流形上，IDE方法的准确性普遍低于现有基准，且随着非均匀曲率增加性能下降最小，表明基准本身难度高。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更具挑战性的测试平台，揭示了现有方法的局限性，特别是在处理非流形空间时。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video

statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action

perform well in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种自监督表示学习范式：自蒸馏互信息(SDMI)和联合互信息(JMI)，为现有方法的架构组件提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然经验上很成功，但其理论基础不足，许多架构组件被视为经验性添加。本文旨在从第一性原理出发，探究学习目标是否决定了可能的优化策略和模型设计选择。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出SDMI和JMI两种训练范式。SDMI需要交替优化，必须使用stop-gradient操作；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。

Result: 证明了现有SSRL方法是这两种范式的具体实例或近似。预测器网络和统计正则化器分别是SDMI和JMI中互信息目标的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: 为现有SSRL方法中不同架构组件的选择提供了超越启发式便利的理论解释，统一了自监督表示学习的理论框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个量化数据集各向异性程度的指标，通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来区分原始数据集和其随机增强版本，揭示了基准点云数据集中存在的高度对齐现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对称感知机器学习方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"，但缺乏评估这一假设的方法。

Method: 开发了一种通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来量化数据集各向异性的指标，在合成数据集上验证后应用于基准点云数据集分析。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐现象；理论上证明分布对称性破坏可能阻止不变方法达到最优性能；经验发现等变方法的有效性具有数据集依赖性。

Conclusion: 理解等变性何时有效及其原因可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差，对称感知方法的适用性取决于具体数据集的特征。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非牛顿流体动力学数值方法计算成本高、可扩展性差，现有数据驱动方法仍需在不同物理条件下重新训练，需要开发更高效的建模方法。

Method: 提出Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer)，利用自注意力机制有效学习复杂流体流动的不同空间相互作用和特征。

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性欠拟合的概念，认为优秀的扩散模型在输入空间的某些区域更准确地逼近分数函数，而在其他区域则欠拟合，这对于理解扩散模型的泛化能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在训练中学习分数函数用于生成样本，但一个基本未解问题是：它们实际学习的是哪个分数？理论上，完全匹配经验分数的模型只会复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Method: 通过引入选择性欠拟合概念，表征这些区域并设计实证干预来验证这一观点。

Result: 研究结果表明选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为其泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化机制的关键，为改进扩散模型提供了新的理论框架和实证验证方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，用于掩码扩散模型（MDMs）的推理时自校正，无需重新训练或架构修改即可检测和修正低质量token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力来检测和修正推理时的低质量token，但现有方法要么需要重构MDM架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的token质量代理，限制了应用性。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。这些质量分数在MDM的前向传播中计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独、无条件文本（170M参数）以及使用LLaDA的代码生成（8B参数）。

Conclusion: PRISM为MDM提供了一种有效的推理时自校正方法，无需模型重新训练，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Motivation: 解决LLM生成中输出质量与推理成本之间的平衡问题，特别是当使用多次生成时，需要在不了解奖励分布的情况下优化生成过程。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价高昂的"盒子"，开发UCB风格的Pandora's Box算法，并通过Bradley-Terry变换处理不同提示间的奖励缩放问题。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 在最优停止理论与推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在保持相对梯度幅度的同时限制敏感度，显著减少子群体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私(DP)虽然提供强隐私保护，但会降低模型性能和公平性，特别是对代表性不足的群体。DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，保持相对梯度幅度同时限制敏感度，结合自适应机制。

Result: 在MIMIC-III、GOSSIS-eICU和Adult Income等数据集上的评估显示，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD减少子群体差异达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少达48%，且这些减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制相结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

TL;DR: 提出Local Linear Attention (LLA)，一种基于非参数统计理论的新型注意力机制，在测试时回归任务中优于线性和Softmax注意力，并通过FlashLLA算法实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有大量研究关注Softmax注意力的高效替代方案，但基于理论洞察寻找更具表达能力（即使计算成本更高）的机制相对较少探索。

Method: 从非参数统计角度提出Local Linear Attention (LLA)，通过偏差-方差权衡分析证明其理论优势；设计两种内存高效原语解决计算复杂度问题；开发FlashLLA硬件高效块状算法；实现定制推理内核减少内存开销。

Result: 在测试时回归、上下文回归、关联回忆和状态跟踪任务中，LLA有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，展示出在大规模模型中应用的潜力。

Conclusion: LLA在理论分析和实证验证中都表现出优势，特别是在处理非平稳数据方面，为大规模Transformer模型提供了有前景的替代注意力机制。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型中OOD检测计算成本高的问题，需要一种快速且通用的检测方法。

Method: 结合雅可比迹和分数函数平方范数形成单一测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需单次前向传播和一次JVP。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域提供了快速可靠的OOD检测实用基础，适用于视觉感知伪影、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集筛选。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了基于模型的强化学习算法MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，并提出了解决方案。研究发现MBPO在DMC任务中失败的主要原因是动力学模型与奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配，以及目标表示选择不当导致的模型方差膨胀。通过解决这些问题，MBPO在7个任务中的5个超越了模型自由算法SAC。

Method: 识别MBPO失败的两个关键问题：动力学模型与奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配导致评论家低估，以及目标表示选择不当导致模型方差膨胀。通过解决这些问题来改进MBPO算法。

Result: 解决了这些失败模式后，MBPO在7个DMC任务中的5个超越了SAC算法，同时保持了在OpenAI Gym中的强性能表现。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

### [151] [How Well Can Preference Optimization Generalize Under Noisy Feedback?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01458)
*Shawn Im,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了噪声反馈对大型语言模型偏好优化的影响，提供了在噪声条件下的泛化保证，分析了不同噪声类型和水平对泛化的影响，并验证了理论发现在当代LLM中的实际相关性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法大多假设无噪声反馈，但现实中人类判断存在错误和不一致性，因此需要研究噪声反馈对模型对齐的影响。

Method: 考虑常见的现实噪声模型（如错误标记和不确定性），分析有限步偏好优化而非传统收敛假设，适用于DPO、IPO、SLiC等多种偏好优化损失函数。

Result: 描述了不同噪声类型和水平下泛化性能的衰减模式，基于偏好数据分布和样本数量进行分析，在当代LLM上进行了实证验证。

Conclusion: 研究为开发符合人类偏好的AI系统提供了有价值的见解，确认了噪声条件下偏好优化理论发现的实际相关性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上的评估显示，LSPO能持续提升学习效果

Conclusion: 通过消融研究验证了将长度信号融入动态采样的不同方法，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则来解释离线到在线强化学习中的不一致性，强调在在线微调时应保留预训练策略或离线数据集中表现更好的知识，同时保持足够的可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致，在一种设置下有效的在线微调设计选择在另一种设置中可能完全失败，需要理论框架来解释和指导设计选择。

Method: 提出了稳定性-可塑性原则，识别了三种在线微调机制，每种机制需要不同的稳定性特性，并通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中的45个案例中，实证结果与该框架的预测高度一致，验证了该原则的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法，使用LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层来构建高效的代理模型，适用于高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程在应对高维不规则变量（如分类、序数变量）的黑盒优化问题时表现不佳，需要更强大的代理模型来提高样本效率。

Method: 采用LLM作为代理模型，结合LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层（VBLL）构建轻量级模型，并通过加权集成（ENS）自动选择超参数。

Result: 在多个高维基准测试和实际分子优化任务中表现出色，计算效率高且支持递归更新。

Conclusion: LLM-based LoRA-VBLL方法为高维黑盒优化提供了有效的解决方案，在样本效率和计算复杂度方面具有优势。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PEL-NAS方法解决LLM驱动的神经架构搜索中的探索偏见问题，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，在保持高精度的同时显著降低延迟和搜索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网方法需要多GPU天，而LLM驱动方法存在探索偏见，无法发现整个搜索空间中不同延迟范围的架构。

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动分区引擎按复杂度划分搜索空间；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，通过知识库更新和引导进化算法；3) 零成本预测器避免从头训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟降低达54%，搜索成本从几天降至几分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS有效解决了LLM驱动NAS的探索偏见问题，能够在保持高精度的同时显著降低延迟和搜索时间。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于密度比加权的行为克隆方法，使用小型清洁参考集通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，在行为克隆目标中加权以优先处理清洁专家行为，无需了解污染机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常被对抗性污染、系统错误或低质量样本污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降，需要一种鲁棒的模仿学习方法。

Method: 使用小型清洁参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，将密度比裁剪后作为权重应用于行为克隆目标，优先处理清洁数据同时降低或丢弃污染数据的影响。

Result: 建立了理论保证，证明在有限样本边界下收敛到清洁专家策略，且边界与污染率无关。在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染率下也能保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: 密度比加权行为克隆是一种有效的鲁棒模仿学习方法，能够在存在数据污染的情况下保持良好性能，为安全关键应用中的离线强化学习提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

TL;DR: 本文提出了对抗性攻击可转移性的关键区分：输入数据空间的攻击可以转移，而模型表示空间的攻击无法转移，除非表示空间存在几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在不同模型间成功转移，但视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移，揭示对抗性转移的根本机制。

Method: 通过四个不同场景提供理论和实证证据：数学证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；构建针对图像分类器和语言模型的表示空间攻击；构建针对视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击；展示表示空间攻击在表示几何对齐时的可转移性。

Result: 证明数据空间攻击确实可以成功转移，而表示空间攻击除非表示几何对齐否则无法转移。表示空间攻击对目标模型有效但无法跨模型转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移并非所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享的数据空间与模型独特的表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒的模型具有重要启示。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Method: 设计了两种新算法：最优权重(OW)和逆意外流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息来改进聚合效果。

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM微调基准测试(UltraFeedback、MMLU)和真实医疗场景(ARMMAN)上的实验表明，新方法在所有情况下都持续优于多数投票。

Conclusion: 这些方法不仅提供了实际性能提升，还为设计鲁棒的多智能体LLM管道提供了概念性见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

Conclusion: 概率节点-关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的有效方法，Flock模型证明了其作为通用近似器的有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，实现零样本预测和插补任务，并提供预测区间。

Result: 在214个全球电网中实现15.82%的零样本预测MAPE；在13个基准电网中平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%，提供95%覆盖率的预测区间；可提供长达21天的预测且精度下降最小；在插补任务上比统计基线提升1.2-3.9倍。

Conclusion: CarbonX能够在数据有限的情况下在任何电网轻松使用并提供强大性能，是面向全球规模脱碳的实用工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

*Woojin Kim,James R. Luedtke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种改进二值神经网络验证的整数规划方法：多类分类的线性目标函数生成和基于BNN递归结构的有效不等式生成，显著提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值神经网络验证问题通常被表述为整数规划问题，但传统方法存在大M约束导致的整数间隙问题，使得求解困难。

Method: 1. 为多类分类场景设计新的线性目标函数生成方法；2. 利用BNN的递归结构生成有效的切割平面不等式。

Result: 与现有IP方法相比，在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 所提出的技术显著改善了BNN验证的整数规划公式，提高了验证效率和鲁棒性评估能力。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RTRL（Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning）的新框架，通过使用往返转换的成功作为奖励信号来训练模型提高一致性，从而解决LLMs在计算化学中缺乏往返一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在计算化学中作为基础模型处理双向任务时，往往缺乏往返一致性，这表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。往返一致性与主要任务性能之间存在强相关性，因此将一致性重新定义为模型改进的直接目标。

Method: 提出了RTRL框架，使用往返转换的成功作为奖励信号来训练模型提高一致性。还提出了一种迭代变体，其中前向和反向映射在自改进循环中交替训练彼此，这种方法在化学中常见的大量未标记数据下具有高数据效率和显著效果。

Result: 实验表明，RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下，显著提升了强基线的性能和一致性。

Conclusion: 往返一致性不仅是理想属性，而且是可训练的目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基础模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的攻击方法，能够绕过大型语言模型的提示防护机制，成功越狱多个生产级模型，揭示了轻量级提示防护的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，确保AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。轻量级提示防护机制因其易于实现和更新而流行，但本文旨在揭示其安全漏洞。

Method: 攻击方法利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够理解的越狱提示。

Result: 该攻击方法在Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口中持续实现越狱，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现代LLM架构中轻量级提示防护固有的攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出，并发现了其他关键对齐问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Motivation: 6G需要将数字信号处理和机器学习无缝集成到蜂窝网络软件栈中，使现代网络生命周期更接近AI系统，实现模型和算法的迭代训练、仿真和部署。

Method: 开发一个鲁棒框架，将基于Python的算法编译成GPU可运行的二进制文件，采用统一方法确保在NVIDIA GPU上的效率、灵活性和最高性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI/ML模型在下一代蜂窝系统中的可扩展集成奠定了基础，对实现原生智能6G网络的愿景至关重要。

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

TL;DR: TSci是一个基于LLM的智能代理框架，用于通用时间序列预测，通过四个专门代理（数据管理、规划、预测、报告）自动完成预处理、模型选择和集成，显著降低预测误差并提高透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测面临数千个短序列、噪声大、频率质量不一的问题，传统方法需要大量人工预处理和验证，且模型泛化能力差，急需一个通用、领域无关的自动化框架。

Method: 构建四个专门代理：Curator进行LLM引导的数据诊断和预处理；Planner通过多模态诊断缩小模型选择空间；Forecaster进行模型拟合验证并自适应选择最佳配置和集成策略；Reporter生成全面透明的报告。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，TSci持续优于统计和基于LLM的基线方法，分别平均降低预测误差10.4%和38.2%，并生成清晰严谨的报告。

Conclusion: TSci将预测工作流转变为可解释、可扩展的白盒系统，显著减少人工干预，提高预测准确性和透明度，为通用时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%，强化学习能有效提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的方法往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤的框架，以提升LLM在科学等高风险领域的应用。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，明确要求完成溯因、干预和预测三个步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%。监督微调能提升域内性能但降低OOD任务准确率，而强化学习在代码和数学问题上均实现1.5-2倍改进，并能泛化到新领域。

Conclusion: 强化学习能诱导核心认知行为并实现领域泛化，为提升LLM反事实推理能力提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、在推理时对齐扩散模型的方法，通过图像空间的KL代理正则化来防止奖励黑客问题，在保持提示一致性的同时提升奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往不满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型产生高分图像但严重偏离原始提示。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL代理，使用冻结的主干网络正则化采样轨迹，约束输出分布，使奖励增加而不发生分布偏移。还提出了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励函数和公共数据集上，MIRA相对于强基线实现了超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随着计算增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA提供了一种有效的推理时对齐方法，能够防止奖励黑客问题，在提升奖励分数的同时保持图像与提示的一致性，且无需微调。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度损失的不同实现方式，建立了统一框架证明'k1 in reward'（如PPO）是Reverse KL正则化的理论正确实现，而'k3 as loss'（如GRPO）只是一阶有偏近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL散度损失的实施可能存在理论偏差，特别是GRPO等方法将KL项作为数值估计而非优化损失，需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的等效性和正确性。

Method: 建立统一分析框架，将两种实现方式（'kn in reward'和'kn as loss'）联系起来，通过梯度等效性分析证明其理论关系，并提出针对off-policy情况的修正方法。

Result: 证明了在on-policy条件下，'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等效，都是RKL目标的正确实现；而'k3 as loss'只是有偏的一阶近似；同时发现off-policy实现因忽略重要性采样而产生偏差。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实施提供了基于梯度的理论依据，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统，推荐使用'k1 in reward'或等效的'k2 as loss'实现方式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

TL;DR: 提出了IBCD（干预贝叶斯因果发现）框架，利用干预数据进行因果发现，通过建模总因果效应矩阵的似然性，结合尖峰-平板马蹄先验和数据驱动的网络结构权重，实现不确定性感知的因果推断。


<details>

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在大规模任务上性能较差且无法量化不确定性，而高通量基因组扰动数据为改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，建模总因果效应矩阵的似然性（近似矩阵正态分布），使用尖峰-平板马蹄先验，从观测数据中分别学习无标度和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量进行不确定性感知推断。

Result: 通过大量模拟实验，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法；应用于521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据，边缘后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中表现出优越性能，能够有效处理大规模干预数据并提供不确定性量化，为基因组扰动数据的因果推断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，在混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载下效率低下，导致GPU利用率差和SLO达成率低。

Method: 提出步骤级序列并行，动态调整单个请求的并行度；采用轮次调度机制，包括时间离散化、步骤级并行度适配和请求联合打包。

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上的广泛评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的SLO达成率提升，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行调度策略，有效解决了DiT模型在严格SLO约束下的服务效率问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自注意力机制识别重要推理步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，根据问题难度自适应分配推理预算，在提高准确率的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型在复杂推理任务中存在适应性不足的问题：简单问题过度推理（过思考）导致token效率低下，而困难问题推理不足（欠思考）导致错误。需要平衡推理长度与任务难度。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法：1）利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤；2）估计问题难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据难度分配推理预算；3）采用在线后训练强化学习框架。

Result: 在多个任务上（AIME、AMC、GPQA-D、BBEH），TRAAC相比基础模型平均绝对准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。在非数学数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合，实现了基于难度的细粒度推理预算调整，在多样化任务上均能获得准确率和效率的提升。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了NoRo框架，通过对比学习增强UPDRS预测的噪声鲁棒性，解决帕金森病远程监测中的三类噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在患者测量不准确、环境噪声和数据包丢失三类噪声，导致UPDRS评分预测误差增加。

Method: 首先将语音特征按选定特征值分组构建对比对，然后训练多层感知机编码器生成噪声鲁棒特征，最后将增强特征输入预测模型。

Result: 实验表明NoRo能显著提升不同噪声环境下各种下游预测模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoRo框架有效解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，提高了UPDRS预测的准确性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

<details>

Motivation: 生成式AI模型中使用的确定性伪随机数生成器会产生可预测模式，易受攻击者利用。传统防御方法存在显著的能耗和延迟开销。

Method: 通过嵌入STT-MTJs硬件生成的真随机比特，构建高度并行的FPGA辅助计算系统，每秒可产生兆比特级真随机数，并通过NIST随机性测试。

Result: 在CIFAR-10训练的生成对抗网络中集成硬件随机比特，与低质量随机数生成器基线相比，不安全输出减少了高达18.6倍。系统具有纳秒级切换速度、高能效和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 基于STT-MTJ的系统有望扩展到超过10^6个并行单元，实现千兆比特每秒的吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样，凸显了自旋电子随机数生成器作为下一代GAI系统实用安全组件的潜力。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Motivation: 理解变分自编码器中后验坍塌现象的本质，揭示其不仅是优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变现象。

Method: 从统计物理学角度分析后验坍塌，通过分析平凡解的稳定性识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上进行验证。

Result: 发现了后验坍塌的临界边界，该边界将有意义的潜在推断与坍塌状态分开，表现为近似后验与先验分布之间KL散度的不连续性。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是一种新兴的相变现象，源于数据结构和变分约束的相互作用，这为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型的后训练中，高SFT分数并不能可靠预测后续强化学习的效果，有时甚至会导致更差的结果。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前实践中SFT和RL两阶段独立训练的做法，质疑高SFT分数是否能转化为RL后的性能提升。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO进行RLVR，在7个数学基准上进行多达256次重复评估，花费超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 发现基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用预RL性能预测更准确，R²系数和Spearman秩相关系数提高了0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k提供了更好的预测能力，这对实际应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据对大语言模型扩展至关重要但供应有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，需要实证验证其效果。

Method: 进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），使用统一协议和扩展定律，比较自然网页数据、多种合成数据（改写文本、生成教科书）及其混合。

Result: 改写合成数据单独训练效果不如自然数据，但1/3改写合成+2/3自然数据混合可显著加速训练；纯教科书合成数据训练效果较差；最佳合成数据比例约30%；更大生成模型不一定产生更好数据。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性益处，改写式合成数据未见性能退化，但教科书式合成数据显示模型崩溃模式，为合成数据使用提供实践指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

TL;DR: 提出了曲率自适应变换器（CAT），通过可学习的门控机制动态路由token到三种几何注意力分支，解决了传统变换器在非欧几里得数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变换器隐含假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的效果。现有方法需要预先固定单一几何，缺乏对混合几何特性的适应性。

Method: 使用轻量级可微分门控机制，动态学习每个token在三种几何注意力分支（欧几里得、双曲、球面）之间的路由，每个分支采用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准测试（FB15k-237, WN18RR）上，相比固定几何基线，MRR和Hits@10指标提升约10%，仅增加5%参数且推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习的几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

Conclusion: 组合模式水印方法能有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑，为保护AI生成内容的完整性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Result: 证明了子二次时间复杂度，为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论依据。

Conclusion: 支撑基分解框架能够有效近似softmax注意力，突破了输入有界的限制，为大语言模型的扩展提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Conclusion: REFEREE方法在无源跨域持续学习场景中表现优异，成功解决了域偏移、噪声伪标签和灾难性遗忘等问题。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

Result: 在多种模型和规模上的广泛实验表明，Elsa在90%稀疏度下比现有最佳方法减少7.8倍困惑度，并能扩展到270亿参数的大模型。

Conclusion: Elsa在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在目前探索有限的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种针对大语言模型RL训练的新框架，通过引入轻量级mini-critics来解决传统价值函数在LLM规模下的计算瓶颈和稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了学习稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL4LLM方法避免使用显式critics，因为传统价值函数在LLM规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失效。本文从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: AsyPPO采用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个critic在不相交的提示分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准。利用critic间不确定性来优化策略更新：在critics一致时屏蔽优势函数，过滤高分歧状态以避免虚假探索。

Result: 在仅使用5,000个样本的开源数据上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比GRPO等强基线，在Qwen3-4b-Base上获得超过6%的性能提升，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上获得约3%的提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO成功恢复了critics在RL4LLM中的角色，同时保持了大规模模型设置下的效率。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，在分类任务中表现突出，在异常检测中表现良好。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

*Wangxuan Fan,Ching Wang,Siqi Li,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值评估KAN网络中节点重要性，解决了传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能够恢复符号表示并保持竞争力性能，但其架构对网络剪枝提出了独特挑战。传统的基于幅度的剪枝方法由于对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不依赖于输入参数化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN能够保持真实的节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了KAN的可解释性优势，促进了在资源受限环境中的部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合网络(AGFN)，通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制，自适应调整特征权重，以解决多模态情感分析中模态质量变化导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的简单融合技术无法有效处理模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在识别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 使用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，在单模态编码和跨模态交互后优先选择信息丰富的线索。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线方法，能有效识别细微情感且具有鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，从更广泛的特征分布中学习，增强了泛化能力，创建了更鲁棒的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于悲观原则的离线数据驱动分类优化框架PASTA，在数据覆盖不足的情况下实现最优收益，并在多种选择模型中建立了首个有限样本遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类优化问题中由于数据覆盖不足导致的挑战，传统方法需要完整覆盖所有可行分类，而实际数据往往无法满足这一要求。

Method: 引入悲观分类优化(PASTA)框架，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优分类，而不需要覆盖所有可行分类，利用悲观原则实现最优预期收益。

Result: 在多项logit和嵌套logit等常用选择模型中建立了首个有限样本遗憾界，证明了PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面的极小极大最优性，数值实验显示优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PASTA框架为离线数据驱动的分类优化提供了有效的解决方案，在数据覆盖不足的情况下仍能保证性能，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

### [192] [Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706)
*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT)框架，通过全局最优传输解决神经网络表示对齐问题，克服传统逐层匹配方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示相似性方法存在三个主要问题：不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度的网络。这些限制源于忽略了全局激活结构和限制映射为刚性的一对一层对应关系。

Method: HOT框架联合推断软性的、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元将质量分布到多个目标层，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在对齐质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示了平滑、细粒度的层次对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自监督学习和隐马尔可夫模型的活动强度识别方法ActiNet，在手腕加速度计数据分析中表现优于传统随机森林方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模流行病学研究中，需要从被动收集的手腕加速度计数据中准确识别人体活动强度，以研究体力活动与健康结果之间的关联。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练18层改进ResNet-V2自监督模型ActiNet，结合隐马尔可夫模型平滑处理，通过5折分层组交叉验证评估性能。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏F1分数为0.82，Cohen's kappa分数为0.86，优于随机森林+HMM方法的0.77和0.81，在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: ActiNet模型在从手腕加速度计数据提取活动强度标签方面表现优异，建议在未来的流行病学研究中推广应用。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能有效降低系统延迟并提升模型性能，为多模态联邦学习在无人机网络中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是一种无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化方法如FlashAttention主要关注I/O层面的系统优化，缺乏数学保证的无损加速方法。

Method: 利用基础分解(BD)的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需4秒离线准备即可应用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16)上，BDA实现了32%更快的键/值投影速度、25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%(FP16)或0.0004%(FP32)，对模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为注意力机制提供了数学保证的加速方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中的模型不确定性，无需生成模型访问，样本复杂度为Õ(1/ε²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒TD学习收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或在函数逼近时需要限制性折扣因子假设，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，针对总变差距离和Wasserstein-l距离不确定性集设计鲁棒算法。

Result: 建立了Õ(1/ε²)的样本复杂度以获得ε-准确的价值估计，填补了鲁棒RL算法实证成功与非鲁棒对应物非渐近保证之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法是模型无关的，不需要生成访问MDP，关键思想可相对直接地扩展到具有函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面面临挑战，需要更有效的方法来理解工作地点选择的复杂决策模式。

Method: 使用深度神经网络(DNN)方法建模工作地点选择，并与传统离散选择模型(DCM)进行比较分析。

Result: DNN在多个方面优于DCM，但DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更一致。DCM在短距离表现更好，DNN在长距离表现与数据和DCM相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点选择分析模型时应根据具体应用需求，两种模型各有优势，DNN显示出作为DCM稳健替代方案的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受噪声和无关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力。

Method: 使用无监督动态特征选择方法，为每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导或冗余信息，仅保留最相关特征。

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，配备无监督DFS的模型在聚类和图像生成等任务中显著提升了泛化性能，计算成本增加极小。

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Motivation: 研究DPSGD对模型公平性的影响，验证直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能实现与非隐私模型相当的公平性水平。

Method: 1）比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的差异性影响；2）在广泛的超参数设置下分析这种影响；3）扩展到DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体。

Result: 不同性能指标的差异性影响不一致；直接优化差分隐私模型超参数不能可靠缓解DPSGD的不公平影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；DPSGD-Global-Adapt对超参数选择不稳健。

Conclusion: 任何形式的超参数调优都会带来额外的隐私泄露，需要在隐私、效用和公平性之间进行仔细权衡；直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是改善效用-公平性权衡的有前景方向，但不能完全解决DPSGD的不公平影响。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Result: 相比传统CPU模拟器实现数量级加速，同时保持原始游戏机制完美保真度。在多游戏上训练RL代理显示训练速度和可扩展性显著提升。

Conclusion: Octax为大规模强化学习实验提供了理想的平台，其模块化设计便于扩展新游戏或使用大语言模型生成新环境。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS)方法，用于预训练离散扩散基础模型的后验采样，解决了现有方法在梯度引导、连续松弛和维度诅咒方面的挑战，在逆问题和图像编辑任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散模型在生成建模中取得显著成功，但大多数基于连续高斯扩散。离散扩散为分类数据提供统一框架，具有更快推理、更精细控制和无需训练即可进行贝叶斯推理的优势，特别适合后验采样。然而现有离散扩散后验采样方法面临梯度引导信号稀疏、连续松弛限制应用和维度诅咒等问题。

Method: 提出Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS)方法，基于两个关键创新：在离散嵌入空间中使用量化期望实现类梯度引导，以及使用锚定重掩码进行自适应解码。

Result: 在标准基准测试的线性和非线性逆问题上，APS在离散扩散采样器中达到最先进性能，并在无需训练的风格化和文本引导编辑任务中展示优势。

Conclusion: APS方法成功克服了离散扩散后验采样的关键挑战，为预训练离散扩散基础模型的有效后验采样提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种训练策略来解决学习非规范哈密顿动力学时的数值不稳定问题，通过直接学习向量场或通过方案学习时间离散动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究分别关注基于势能的架构和退化变分积分器，但在结合两者时出现数值不稳定问题，导致长时间模拟无法进行。

Method: 提出两种训练策略：直接学习向量场，或通过方案学习时间离散动力学。

Result: 在多个数值测试案例中评估了方法学习复杂物理动力学的能力，如陀螺动力学等离子体物理中的引导中心。

Conclusion: 识别了问题并提出了有效的解决方案，能够学习复杂的非规范哈密顿动力学系统。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Motivation: 在真实应用中增量更新扩散模型具有实用性但计算挑战大，需要解决灾难性遗忘问题并保持模型原有能力。

Method: CNS方法独特识别扩散模型中与目标概念相关的神经元，以增量方式微调这些概念神经元，并联合保留先前学习到的知识。

Result: 在真实数据集评估中，CNS以最少的参数调整实现了最先进的性能，在单概念和多概念个性化任务中均优于先前方法，且无需融合操作，减少了存储和处理时间。

Conclusion: CNS是一种简单有效的持续学习策略，能够高效实现扩散模型的增量个性化，同时保持零样本文本到图像生成能力。

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

Motivation: 验证后处理隐私过滤技术在医学AI研究中生成隐私保护合成数据集的有效性，这些技术声称能移除包含个人身份信息的样本。

Method: 对胸部X光合成应用过滤管道进行严格评估，分析其检测训练数据生成近似重复样本的能力。

Result: 当前过滤器表现出有限的特异性和一致性，仅对真实图像实现高灵敏度，但无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近似重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤存在关键局限，可能提供虚假安全感而无法有效保护患者隐私，需要过滤器设计的重大改进才能在敏感应用中部署。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

TL;DR: 提出Equilibrium Matching (EqM)框架，通过平衡动力学视角构建生成模型，学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，在推理时采用基于优化的采样过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散和基于流的生成模型使用非平衡、时间条件动态，EqM旨在通过平衡动态视角改进生成建模。

Method: 丢弃传统模型的时间条件动态，学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，在推理时使用梯度下降、可调步长、自适应优化器和自适应计算进行采样。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上达到FID 1.90，超越了扩散/流模型的生成性能，并能处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM在流模型和基于能量的模型之间建立了更紧密的桥梁，提供了优化驱动推理的简单途径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种宽-窄-宽（Hourglass）MLP块结构，挑战了传统的窄-宽-窄MLP设计。Hourglass结构在扩展维度上进行跳跃连接，而残差计算通过窄瓶颈进行，实现了更高的性能参数比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索在扩展维度上进行跳跃连接的新架构，以提升模型性能同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出Hourglass MLP块，其中跳跃连接在扩展维度操作，残差计算通过窄瓶颈流动。使用随机初始化的固定投影将输入提升到扩展维度，实现高效训练和推理。

Result: Hourglass架构在生成任务上始终优于传统设计，随着参数预算增加，最优配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的放置方式，这种设计理念可扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

*Adam Filipek*

TL;DR: 提出稀疏查询注意力(SQA)架构，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多头注意力(MHA)的二次计算复杂度问题，现有方法如MQA和GQA只解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力得分计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: SQA通过减少查询头数量来直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，提出了理论基础和数学公式，以及一系列架构变体。

Result: 在32k-200k令牌的长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，对模型质量影响很小。

Conclusion: SQA是构建更高效和可扩展模型的有力工具，在Reactive Transformer架构开发中被偶然发现。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的方法来处理组合优化问题。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练时随机采样生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用广义强化策略优化进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常达到最佳性能，并能持续避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 顺序不变强化学习框架在组合优化中表现出色，通过促进搜索空间多样性和关注相关变量依赖，提高了样本效率和性能稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Result: 提出的方法显著减少了计算开销，同时仍能为给定数据集选择最佳模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为AutoML工作流程提供了转变，通过智能预选模型在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标，为形式验证领域开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Conclusion: LieNLSD是首个能够确定非线性无穷小生成元数量及其显式表达式的方法，在复杂对称性发现中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表达能力和概率推理的数据效率，实现了快速的组合式元学习。

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

Conclusion: 梯度空间分析揭示了子空间动态特性的重要规律，基于这些洞察的随机算法能有效解决LLM训练中的内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥是恢复静态数据中隐藏动态的实用且原则性方法

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力变换器的多模态基础模型，整合电子健康记录、医学影像、遗传学和可穿戴设备数据，通过跨模态关联实现早期疾病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断模型孤立分析不同医疗数据源，限制了发现跨模态相关性以进行早期疾病诊断的能力。

Method: 使用专用编码器将各模态数据映射到共享潜在空间，通过多头注意力和残差归一化进行融合，支持多任务预训练和轻松适应新疾病。

Result: 在肿瘤学、心脏病学和神经学基准数据集上进行早期检测任务测试，框架包含数据治理和模型管理工具以提高透明度和临床可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现精准诊断的统一基础模型迈出重要一步，有望提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索了Tsetlin Machine在大型多通道图像分类中的应用，提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法，在保持可解释性的同时实现了与深度学习模型相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Tsetlin Machine基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑，比神经网络更具可解释性。本文旨在探索TM架构在复杂大规模图像分类任务中的适用性，同时保持其可解释性优势。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为在更复杂多样数据集上的应用提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了RoGRAD框架，首次将检索增强生成(RAG)与迭代图对比学习结合，用于处理图结构数据中的复合缺陷问题，相比传统GNN和LLM增强方法取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图结构数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响GNN性能。现有研究缺乏对图原生方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强方法是否始终优于传统方法尚不明确。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架，采用迭代范式而非一次性增强设计，通过检索增强生成(RAG)注入基于检索的增强，提供类别一致且多样化的增强，并通过迭代图对比学习强制区分性表示。

Result: RoGRAD在广泛实验中表现出色，优于传统GNN和LLM增强基线方法，平均改进达到82.43%。

Conclusion: RoGRAD将LLM图增强从静态信号注入转变为动态精炼，揭示了LLM增强并非始终优于传统方法，并提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何感知的LoRA扩展方法，通过三因子分解U-S-V⊤将适配器的输入和输出子空间分离，并约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，从而提升低秩适应的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适应(LoRA)方法在性能上仍落后于全参数微调，部分原因是未能充分利用低秩流形的几何结构。

Method: 使用三因子分解U-S-V⊤，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成、图像分类和图像生成等广泛下游任务中，该方法优于最新的LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法能够有效学习子空间，同时保持与现有微调管道的兼容性，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Result: 获得了比现有方法更紧的对抗风险下界，特别是在交叉熵损失函数下，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的对偶和重心重构方法为超越0-1损失设置的对抗鲁棒分类提供了理论基础和实用工具，揭示了对抗鲁棒性与优化理论中其他重要问题的深刻联系。

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MTS异常检测方法面临三个主要挑战：无监督方法依赖误差阈值导致不准确；半监督方法未充分利用异常标签；监督方法难以捕捉局部关系、计算成本高且受限于标注数据稀缺。

Method: 1. 引入MV-MTF技术将数值时间序列转换为图像表示；2. 使用多模态CNN通过参数共享融合数值和图像数据；3. 采用SHAP-based异常解释器识别关键异常变量。

Conclusion: Moon框架通过模态转换和多模态融合有效解决了现有MTS异常检测方法的局限性，在效率、准确性和可解释性方面均表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Conclusion: 成功将后处理校准技术集成到联邦学习中，提出了针对不同场景的优化策略，缓解了异构性下的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Conclusion: 几何信息引导的探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

TL;DR: GraphNC是一个图异常检测框架，通过教师模型的异常分数分布对齐和基于扰动的正态性正则化，来校准图数据的正态性，提高异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误检率。需要利用标注和未标注数据共同校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个主要组件：异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA)和基于扰动的正态性正则化(NormReg)。ScoreDA通过将模型异常分数与教师模型的分数分布对齐来优化分数；NormReg通过在标注节点上最小化扰动引导的一致性损失，使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: 该方法有效将正常和异常类别的异常分数拉向两端，产生更可分离的异常分数，同时通过表示空间的正则化缓解教师模型不准确分数的误导。

Conclusion: GraphNC通过联合利用标注和未标注数据，在异常分数和节点表示空间校准正态性，提高了半监督图异常检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Motivation: 单一流模型在不同类型的分布上表现不一致，需要一种能够适应各种后验分布形状和模态的鲁棒变分推理方法。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段顺序训练各个流专家，第二阶段通过似然驱动的更新进行自适应全局权重估计，无需逐样本门控或架构更改。

Result: 在六种典型后验分布上，AMF-VI实现了比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，在Wasserstein-2和最大均值差异等传输指标上获得稳定增益。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流提供了一条可靠路径，可在保持各专家归纳偏好的同时，实现跨不同后验分布的鲁棒变分推理。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Conclusion: PPGen为PPG模型提供了一条路径，既能保持深度学习特征所需的保真度，又能支持临床解释和硬件设计。

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过最大似然估计对Flow Matching模型进行微调，以解决训练-推理差距问题，在图像生成和机器人操作任务中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching算法在训练和推理阶段存在差距，无法在训练时评估模型输出，且在追求直线路径时可能引入刚度等问题，这在高精度场景如机器人操作中尤为明显。

Result: 在图像生成和机器人操作任务上的实验结果表明，该方法可靠地提升了Flow Matching模型的推理性能。

Conclusion: 提出的最大似然估计微调方法有效解决了FM的训练-推理差距问题，提高了模型在高精度任务中的性能。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

Motivation: Web应用需要快速响应的时间序列预测来支持实时决策，如资源规划、缓存放置和异常响应，而现有方法存在误差累积或过度平滑的问题。

Method: 采用非自回归设计，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免自回归方法中的误差累积问题，同时改进现有非自回归模型的过度平滑预测。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练后，KAIROS在六个基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的先进基础模型相当，但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: KAIROS展示了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的时间序列预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从非结构化模型仓库（如Hugging Face）学习权重空间表示的方法，无需依赖精心策划的模型动物园，突破了权重空间学习领域的计算资源限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重空间学习通常需要大量精心构建的已训练模型集合（模型动物园），这需要大量计算资源，限制了权重空间表示的规模和灵活性。本文旨在摆脱这一限制。

Method: 提出了一种新的权重空间骨干网络，专门设计用于处理非结构化模型群体，从Hugging Face等大型非结构化模型仓库中下载任意模型进行训练。

Result: 在Hugging Face模型上训练的权重空间表示实现了强大的性能，通常优于在实验室生成的模型动物园上训练的骨干网络，并且能够泛化到未见过的数据模态。

Conclusion: 通过证明可以在非结构化环境中学习高质量的权重空间表示，表明精心策划的模型动物园并非不可或缺，从而克服了权重空间学习社区当前面临的重大限制。

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

TL;DR: 提出了PENEX（惩罚指数损失），这是一种新的多类指数损失公式，可以通过一阶方法进行优化，在深度神经网络训练中表现出正则化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost在实践中随着弱学习器数量增加而泛化良好，但其指数损失难以通过一阶方法优化。需要一种理论上有依据且易于优化的指数损失替代方案。

Method: 引入PENEX损失函数，这是一种新的多类指数损失公式，理论上基于AdaBoost框架，但可以通过梯度方法进行优化。

Result: PENEX在计算机视觉和语言任务中表现出优于现有方法的正则化效果，能够隐式最大化数据点的边界，并且梯度增量隐式参数化了提升框架中的弱学习器。

Conclusion: PENEX作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，在深度神经网络的训练和微调中具有有效潜力。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Motivation: 伊朗作为全球第二大天然气资源国，面临人口增长和能源消耗增加导致的冬季气压下降和天然气中断问题，需要控制居民部门（最大消费部门）的天然气消费。

Method: 使用机器学习模型（LSTM、GRU和混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型），基于2017-2022年六年的天然气消费和气象数据进行分析和预测。

Result: 混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型在准确性方面表现最优，具有更低的RMSE、MAPE和MPE值，在数据有限的情况下也表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法特别是混合模型可有效管理和预测天然气消费，提高资源管理效率并减少季节性短缺，地理和气候因素在预测建模中具有重要影响。

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端框架，在数千万几何对中实现精确召回率控制，将召回率方差控制在1%以内，同时保持TPU友好性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回率控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度手动审查会增加成本。

Method: 采用等网格边界框过滤和CSR候选表示减少对枚举，使用确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经排序器，通过四种阈值估计器的逆方差加权聚合来构建集成方法。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法始终在较小误差内达到召回目标，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成多个阈值估计器和分层校准策略，实现了精确且低方差的召回率控制，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

TL;DR: DECOR是一个用于线性高斯结构方程模型的联合学习方法，能够同时学习有向无环图和相关噪声模型，在存在潜在混杂的情况下实现结构学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而去混杂流程依赖于普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够处理潜在混杂的统一方法。

Method: 提出DECOR方法，基于似然的完全可微分估计器，交替进行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，可包含轻量弓形互补惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别是在非普遍混杂情况下表现稳健，在普遍混杂情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混杂的线性高斯SEMs提供了一种有效的联合学习方法，理论保证了在弓形自由图和噪声协方差具有均匀特征值边界时的全局参数可识别性。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的guidance机制扩展到标准在线强化学习方法，探索可控强化学习的新方向。

Method: 在策略梯度中增加无条件分支，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现guidance，理论推导表明在优势估计下额外归一化项会消失。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件dropout在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大guidance能持续改善稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: guidance机制可以成功适配标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

*Alexander Ryabchenko,Wenlong Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Motivation: 传统SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关。

Method: 使用各向同性高斯噪声扰动参数，优化随机平滑目标函数，隐式捕获曲率信息。

Result: 理论证明fSGLD收敛到Hessian迹正则化损失函数的全局最小化器，实验显示在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中达到优越泛化和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: fSGLD能有效寻找平坦最小值，计算成本仅为SGD级别，是SAM的一半，为随机权重扰动提供了严格理论解释。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在现实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，填补了金融领域动态交易评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态迭代特性，而金融领域对经济价值和高风险决策具有直接相关性。

Method: 设计多个月股票交易环境，代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），做出买入、卖出或持有的顺序决策，使用累计回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估显示大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有基准，但部分模型展现出获得更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 精通静态金融知识任务不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，StockBench作为开源资源支持可重复性和该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练掩码扩散大语言模型，使其推理能力更强且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练扩散大语言模型时存在似然性难以处理的问题，需要更准确的近似方法和更高效的采样策略来优化推理计算效率。

Method: 提出两阶段似然近似结合重要性采样校正的强化学习算法，并联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型，获得了更好的样本效率和任务性能，在减少函数评估次数的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过联合训练模型和采样器，显著改善了扩散大语言模型在推理时间计算方面的帕累托前沿性能。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据由异质群体组成，但大规模推荐模型在单一全局目标下训练会忽略头尾分布，导致注意力权重不活跃或神经元死亡，限制了模型学习能力。

Method: 利用注意力机制在因子分解机中进行共享嵌入选择，通过分析数据子结构并暴露具有强分布对比的样本，使用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上评估六个SOTA模型，因子分解机能够捕捉细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低0.16%，在目标少数群体上增益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: C2AL方法通过辅助学习有效解决了推荐模型中的分布不平衡问题，在保持与少数群体互信息的同时提升了全局性能。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了扩散模型在时序数据插补中理论理解的空白，为评估和改进插补方法提供了统计基础，并展示了混合掩码训练的有效性。

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只预测每个时间步的独立边际分布，而非完整的联合预测分布。要生成具有现实相关性结构的预测样本路径，通常需要昂贵的自回归采样。

Method: 采用copula方法，通过一次前向传递从现有的多步时间序列基础模型高效生成具有相关性的样本路径。

Result: 该方法生成相关样本路径的速度比自回归采样快数个数量级，并通过缓解误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: copula方法为从多步时间序列基础模型生成相关样本路径提供了一种高效且准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较Transformer和xLSTM的扩展规律，发现在典型LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更好的扩展性，且随着训练和推理上下文增长，xLSTM的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer一直是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在保持数十亿参数规模竞争力的同时，对上下文长度具有线性复杂度。需要研究这些架构的扩展行为来指导未来模型设计和部署。

Method: 1. 在广泛模型规模(80M-7B)和训练token数量(2B-2T)上，使用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法研究xLSTM在计算最优和过训练机制下的扩展行为；2. 研究最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；3. 分析推理时扩展特性。

Result: 在典型LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer扩展更有利。重要的是，随着训练和推理上下文增长，xLSTM的优势会扩大。

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展性方面优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景中，这为未来大语言模型架构选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，这种灵活性引入了分布式切片移动性攻击的漏洞，这是一种分布式拒绝服务攻击形式。

Method: 利用正未标记学习，结合长短期记忆自编码器和K-Means聚类，使用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为机器学习模型特征。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试平台上评估，在10%到40%攻击污染的训练数据集上F1分数超过98.50%，优于同类解决方案。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能有效检测分布式切片移动性攻击变种，在存在污染训练数据时保持鲁棒性，为5G网络切片安全提供有力保障。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战深度学习优化中全网络更新的传统假设，证明这种更新方式在理论和实践中都存在根本性次优问题

Method: 引入非欧几里得随机渐进训练方法Drop-Muon，每个步骤只更新随机选择的层子集，结合渐进式训练效率和层特定非欧几里得更新

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络Muon，达到相同准确度时wall-clock时间快1.4倍，并提供了在层级平滑性和随机梯度设置下的收敛保证

Conclusion: 全网络更新并非最优选择，除非满足特定层平滑常数关系，Drop-Muon为大规模模型训练提供了高效的理论基础替代方案

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均提升3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上都能稳定训练

Conclusion: 原则性经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO框架显著提升了推理性能并稳定了训练过程

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的许多有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Motivation: 解决反应式干扰问题，干扰者采用动态策略选择信道和感知阈值来检测并干扰传输，需要一种无需先验知识就能自适应对抗干扰的方法。

Method: 采用Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，使用深度Q网络(DQN)处理连续状态(基于接收功率)，通过不同的奖励函数和动作集来学习最优策略。

Result: 强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时仍能维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态干扰环境的有效方法，能够在不了解信道条件或干扰策略的情况下实现自适应抗干扰。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在射频信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为无线诊断、部署和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

TL;DR: DialTree-RPO是一个基于强化学习和树搜索的框架，用于自动发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，在10个目标模型上比现有方法攻击成功率提高25.9%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下容易受到对抗攻击，现有方法要么依赖人工红队测试，要么使用预定义模板，未能探索复杂对话动态中涌现的新攻击轨迹。

Method: 将对话建模为序列决策问题，结合树搜索的在线策略强化学习框架，无需人工标注数据就能系统性地探索多轮攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上攻击成功率比现有最优方法提高25.9%以上，并能有效发现新的攻击策略。

Conclusion: 该方法能自主学习最大化多轮攻击成功的对话策略，显著提升了发现LLM安全漏洞的能力。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练采用固定的优化方案，缺乏灵活性来动态应对训练过程中的不稳定性和问题，需要更灵活的交互式训练方法。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为中介，实现用户或AI代理与训练过程之间的实时通信，支持动态调整优化器超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究证明，该方法实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求变化的适应性。

Conclusion: Interactive Training为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了扩散模型成功背后的机制，认为其强泛化能力源于对数据低维几何结构的适应，并通过理论分析和实验验证了平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在各种领域展现了最先进的性能和显著的泛化能力，但其成功机制尚未完全理解。基于流形假设，研究者推测这种成功源于模型对数据低维几何结构的适应能力。

Method: 通过研究经验分数匹配目标最小化器的平滑效应来检验隐式正则化的作用。理论分析和实验验证了平滑分数函数（或等价地在对数密度域中平滑）会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。

Result: 研究证实了平滑分数函数确实会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑现象，并且可以通过选择适当的平滑来控制扩散模型泛化所沿的流形。

Conclusion: 该工作为扩散模型成功源于对数据低维几何结构适应的猜想提供了证据，表明平滑机制在扩散模型的泛化能力中起着关键作用，且这种泛化流形可以通过平滑选择来控制。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计数据流形的切空间，相比传统LPCA方法在高噪声环境下表现更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统局部主成分分析(LPCA)在高噪声设置下存在邻域大小选择的临界权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声特征知识，而这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO方法利用数据的全局结构指导局部切空间估计，通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间。

Result: 实验表明LEGO产生的切空间估计比LPCA对噪声更鲁棒，在流形学习、边界检测和局部内在维度估计等下游任务中取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的全局结构信息，有效解决了高噪声环境下切空间估计的挑战，为数据流形分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过压缩KV缓存蒸馏知识，将教师模型的显式推理轨迹转化为学生模型的隐式推理能力，在保持效率的同时提升复杂自然语言推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理计算成本高且包含冗余信息，而隐式推理缺乏有效监督信号，限制了在复杂自然语言推理中的效果。

Method: 提出KaVa框架，通过自蒸馏将教师模型压缩KV缓存中的知识转移到隐式推理学生模型，利用连续隐式token对齐步进KV轨迹。

Result: 方法在隐式推理基准上表现优异，从方程到自然语言推理的性能下降显著减小，可扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为隐式推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了显式推理的准确性和隐式推理的效率优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.
