### [1] [Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13338)
*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于证据检索的不确定性感知决策机制，通过查找近似示例并结合Dempster-Shafer理论来实现每个实例的适配性阈值，提高了决策的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代单一全局阈值方法，提供一种更可靠、可解释的不确定性感知决策方法，以减少自信错误的结果并保持可持续的审查负荷。

Method: 使用嵌入空间检索每个测试实例的近似示例，通过Dempster-Shafer理论融合它们的预测分布，形成融合信念作为每个实例的适配性阈值机制。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100数据集上使用BiT和ViT背榜进行实验，显示了更高或相当的不确定性感知性能，大幅减少了自信错误的结果，并保持可持续的审查负荷。仅需少量证据即可实现这些收益。

Conclusion: 证据条件化标记提供了比固定预测熵阈值更可靠和可解释的替代方案，适用于操作性的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware
decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an
evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance,
proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive
distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief
acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences
are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable
uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect
outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on
prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize
these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These
results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and
interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for
operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.

*Muhammad Adnan Shahzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 混合量子-经典神经网络在MNIST、CIFAR100和STL10三个基准数据集上相比纯经典模型在准确率、训练效率和资源使用方面表现更优，特别是在复杂数据集上优势更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统比较混合量子-经典神经网络与纯经典模型在性能、效率和鲁棒性方面的差异，评估量子计算在深度学习中的实际价值。

Method: 使用参数化量子电路与经典深度学习架构结合的混合模型，与传统的卷积神经网络进行对比，在三个数据集上进行50个训练周期的实验，评估验证准确率、测试准确率、训练时间、计算资源使用和对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 混合模型在最终准确率上显著优于经典模型（MNIST: 99.38% vs 98.21%, CIFAR100: 41.69% vs 32.25%, STL10: 74.05% vs 63.76%），训练速度快5-12倍，参数减少6-32%，内存使用更少，但在复杂数据集上的对抗鲁棒性相似。

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典架构在准确率、训练效率和参数可扩展性方面具有明显优势，特别适用于复杂的视觉任务，为量子计算在深度学习中的应用提供了有力证据。

Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical
neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets
(MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and
robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with
classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted
over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation
accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and
adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings
demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in
final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\%
(STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%,
32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with
dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%)
and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g.,
21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while
maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness
tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler
datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but
show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\%
robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models
consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization
(9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid
quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy,
training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种集成技术框架，通过优化YOLOv11-DIoU和DeepSort算法提高了遮挡情况下的车辆感知准确性，并使用GRU-Attention模型捕捉拒塞预兆特征，实现了高精度的拒塞预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速公路交通拒塞严重影响旅行效率和地区联通性。现有的"u68c0测-u9884测"系统存在遮挡情况下车辆感知准确性低和长序列拒塞预测依赖关系失败等关键缺陷。

Method: 1. 交通流感知优化：YOLOv11升级为YOLOv11-DIoU（替换GIoU Loss为DIoU Loss），DeepSort融合马海洋距离（运动）和余弦距离（外观）
2. 拒塞预警：构建GRU-Attention模型捕捉拒塞预兆特征，使用流量、密度、速度数据训练300连续轮

2. DeepSort达到93.8% MOTA（比SORT提高11.3%），仅4次ID切换
3. GRU-Attention模型测试准确率达99.7%（比传统GRU提高7-9%），10分钟预警时间误差≤1分钟
4. 独立视频验证显示95%预警准确率，>90%拒塞点空间重叠率

Conclusion: 该集成框架有效解决了遮挡情况下车辆感知和长序列拒塞预测的问题，为高速公路拒塞控制提供了量化支持，具有广阔的智慧交通应用前景。

Abstract: Expressway traffic congestion severely reduces travel efficiency and hinders
regional connectivity. Existing "detection-prediction" systems have critical
flaws: low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and loss of
long-sequence dependencies in congestion forecasting. This study proposes an
integrated technical framework to resolve these issues.For traffic flow
perception, two baseline algorithms were optimized. Traditional YOLOv11 was
upgraded to YOLOv11-DIoU by replacing GIoU Loss with DIoU Loss, and DeepSort
was improved by fusing Mahalanobis (motion) and cosine (appearance) distances.
Experiments on Chang-Shen Expressway videos showed YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7\%
mAP (6.5 percentage points higher than baseline) with 5.3\% occlusion miss
rate. DeepSort reached 93.8\% MOTA (11.3 percentage points higher than SORT)
with only 4 ID switches. Using the Greenberg model (for 10-15 vehicles/km
high-density scenarios), speed and density showed a strong negative correlation
(r=-0.97), conforming to traffic flow theory. For congestion warning, a
GRU-Attention model was built to capture congestion precursors. Trained 300
epochs with flow, density, and speed, it achieved 99.7\% test accuracy (7-9
percentage points higher than traditional GRU). In 10-minute advance warnings
for 30-minute congestion, time error was $\leq$ 1 minute. Validation with an
independent video showed 95\% warning accuracy, over 90\% spatial overlap of
congestion points, and stable performance in high-flow ($>$5 vehicles/second)
scenarios.This framework provides quantitative support for expressway
congestion control, with promising intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: This research is part of a study of a real-time, cloud-based on-street
parking service using crowd-sourced in-vehicle fleet data. The service provides
real-time information about available parking spots by classifying
crowd-sourced detections observed via ultrasonic sensors. The goal of this

automation of the existing test process for ground truth tests. Therefore,
methods from the field of machine learning, especially image pattern
recognition, are applied to enrich the database and substitute human
engineering work in major areas of the analysis process. After an introduction
into the related areas of machine learning, this paper explains the methods and
implementations made to achieve a high level of automation, applying
convolutional neural networks. Finally, predefined metrics present the
performance level achieved, showing a time reduction of human resources up to
99.58 %. The overall improvements are discussed, summarized, and followed by an
outlook for future development and potential application of the analysis
automation tool.

### [5] [An Empirical Analysis of VLM-based OOD Detection: Mechanisms, Advantages, and Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13375)
*Yuxiao Lee,Xiaofeng Cao,Wei Ye,Jiangchao Yao,Jingkuan Song,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了基于视觉语言模型(VLM)的零样本分布外检测机制，揭示了VLM相比单模态方法的优势源于语义新颖性利用能力，同时发现其对提示词表述高度敏感的关键脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本分布外检测方面表现出色，但研究界对其工作机制、相比单模态方法的优势以及行为鲁棒性仍缺乏系统理解。

Method: 通过系统实证分析，使用分布内和分布外提示词，从机制、优势和敏感性三个维度对VLM嵌入空间的关键操作特性进行形式化表征和量化评估。

Result: VLM在分布外检测中优于单模态方法，主要优势在于能够利用丰富的语义新颖性；同时发现VLM对图像噪声具有韧性，但对提示词表述高度敏感的不对称鲁棒性特征。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对VLM基分布外检测方法优势和关键脆弱性的结构化理解，为开发更鲁棒可靠的未来设计提供了实证基础指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities, vital for reliable
AI systems. Despite this promising capability, a comprehensive understanding of
(1) why they work so effectively, (2) what advantages do they have over
single-modal methods, and (3) how is their behavioral robustness -- remains
notably incomplete within the research community. This paper presents a
systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution
(ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and
formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that
facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the
superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches,
attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich
semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously
under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting
resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive
to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of
the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection,
offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and
reliable future designs.

Abstract: Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we
introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of
discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the
metric relations between triples of points and other points. More
significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative
measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those
produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments
demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the
intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale
geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of
dimensionality reduction techniques.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地解决电力传输系统中异物入侵的实时检测和跟踪问题，具有高准确度、强稳健性和边缘部署能力，支持增量学习新物体而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-stage framework for real-time foreign
object intrusion (FOI) detection and tracking in power transmission systems.
The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust
object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with
triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted
IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and
motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for
deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The
system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen
objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive
experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the
framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In
addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's
practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.

### [9] [EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Scalable, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399)
*Tianyu Chen,Yasi Zhang,Zhi Zhang,Peiyu Yu,Shu Wang,Zhendong Wang,Kevin Lin,Xiaofei Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Linjie Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Jianwen Xie,Oscar Leong,Lijuan Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Mingyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdiVal-Agent是一个自动化、可扩展的细粒度评估框架，用于基于指令的图像编辑评估，通过对象中心视角和专家工具套件来解决当前评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于指令的图像编辑评估方法存在两个主要问题：(i)依赖配对参考图像导致覆盖范围有限且继承先前生成模型的偏见；(ii)仅依赖零样本视觉语言模型(VLMs)的评估往往不精确。需要更可靠和可解释的评估方案。

Method: EdiVal-Agent首先将图像分解为语义上有意义的对象，然后合成多样化、上下文感知的编辑指令。评估时结合VLMs与开放词汇对象检测器评估指令遵循性，使用语义级特征提取器评估内容一致性，并利用人类偏好模型判断视觉质量。

Result: 研究表明，将VLMs与对象检测器结合使用在指令遵循性评估方面比单独使用VLMs和基于CLIP的指标更能与人类判断达成一致。模块化设计允许未来工具无缝集成，提高评估准确性。

Conclusion: EdiVal-Agent能够识别现有失败模式，为下一代编辑模型的开发提供信息。该框架建立了EdiVal-Bench基准，涵盖9种指令类型和11种最先进的编辑模型，展示了其在多轮编辑评估中的有效性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and
interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i)
depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and
inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on
zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of
instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often
imprecise.
  To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and
fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from
an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an
image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects,
then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation,
it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction
following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content
consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We
show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with
human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs
alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows
future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over
time.
  Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing
benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models
spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1),
flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be
used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of
the next generation of editing models. Project page:

TL;DR: MapAnything是一个统一的基于transformer的前馈模型，能够处理单张或多张图像及可选几何输入，直接回归度量3D场景几何和相机参数，在多种3D视觉任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决3D视觉任务中需要多个专门模型的问题，开发一个统一的模型来处理多种3D重建任务，提高效率和性能。

Method: 使用基于transformer的前馈架构，输入图像和可选几何信息，通过分解的多视图场景几何表示（深度图、局部射线图、相机位姿和度量尺度因子）进行训练。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务中优于或匹配专门的模型，提供更高效的联合训练性能。

Conclusion: MapAnything为通用3D重建骨干网络铺平了道路，展示了统一模型在多样化3D任务中的强大潜力。

Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that
ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera
intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly
regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a
factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of
depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that
effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric
frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets,
along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad
range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated
structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth
estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide
extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that
MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while
offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a
universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

TL;DR: 提出SCM-PR框架，结合RGB图像语义信息实现鲁棒的激光雷达地图定位，在KITTI数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无GPS环境下机器人定位问题，现有RGB方法对光照、天气等变化敏感，跨模态方法在复杂场景和视角变化下表现不佳

Method: 使用VMamba骨干网络提取RGB特征，引入语义感知特征融合模块，结合语义分割掩码，设计激光雷达语义几何描述符，在NetVLAD中加入跨模态语义注意力机制

Result: 在KITTI和KITTI-360数据集上相比其他跨模态地点识别方法取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过融合高层语义信息，SCM-PR框架显著提升了跨模态地点识别的鲁棒性和准确性，特别是在复杂场景和视角变化情况下

Abstract: Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS
capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can
potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to
changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing
cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB
images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above.
Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or
high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint.
In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal
Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB
images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a
VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature
Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks;
LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a
cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching.
Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a
Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in
a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and
KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

### [12] [Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression by Scene-Adaptive Lattice Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13482)
*Hao Xu,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出场景自适应格点向量量化(SALVQ)方法，通过优化格点基向量来改进3D高斯泼溅数据的压缩性能，在保持低复杂度的同时提升率失真效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法都使用均匀标量量化(USQ)，虽然简单但效率有限。需要探索更先进的量化器来提升压缩性能，同时保持低开销和系统改动最小。

Method: 用格点向量量化(LVQ)替代USQ，并为每个场景优化格点基向量，实现场景自适应LVQ(SALVQ)。通过缩放格点基向量可动态调整量化密度，支持多码率目标。

Result: SALVQ能无缝集成到现有3DGS压缩架构中，以最小的修改和计算开销提升率失真性能。单个模型可适应多种压缩级别，显著减少训练时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: SALVQ在向量量化的率失真效率和USQ的低复杂度之间取得了良好平衡，为3DGS压缩提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its
photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates
massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost
effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression
methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance.
However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its
simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can
improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead
and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with
lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific
characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's
adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a
balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low
complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS
compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal
modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice
basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single
model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the
need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly
reducing training time and memory consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解公共场所的群体社交互动对城市规划至关重要，需要从图像中解读超越传统目标检测的复杂视觉线索

Method: 三阶段流水线：1) 现成的人体检测和深度估计；2) 基于VLM的成对社交关系分类；3) 轻量级空间聚合算法定位社交连接群体

Result: 创建了包含10万张街景图像的新数据集，结合人工标注和MINGLE输出，确保语义丰富性和真实场景覆盖

Conclusion: MINGLE方法有效解决了社交群体区域检测任务，为未来研究提供了高质量数据集和可行解决方案

Abstract: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for
urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive
environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting
subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically
complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this
challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires
inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract
interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level
Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf
human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify
pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation
algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and
encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view
images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and
socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and
outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage
of real-world scenarios.

*Rajatsubhra Chakraborty,Xujun Che,Depeng Xu,Cori Faklaris,Xi Niu,Shuhan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiasMap是一个模型无关的框架，用于发现稳定扩散模型中的潜在概念级表征偏见，通过交叉注意力归因图揭示人口统计特征与语义概念的结构性纠缠，并提出基于能量引导扩散采样的偏见缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注输出层面的人口统计分布，无法保证偏见缓解后概念表征的解耦。需要更深层次地探索图像生成过程中的表征偏见。

Method: 利用交叉注意力归因图量化人口统计-语义概念的空间纠缠（通过IoU指标），并采用能量引导扩散采样方法在去噪过程中直接修改潜在噪声空间以最小化SoftIoU期望值。

Result: 研究发现现有公平性干预措施可能减少输出分布差距，但往往无法解耦概念级耦合，而BiasMap的缓解方法能够在图像生成中减轻概念纠缠，同时补充分布偏见缓解。

Conclusion: BiasMap提供了一个发现和缓解潜在概念级表征偏见的新框架，能够揭示现有公平性发现方法中隐藏的偏见，并通过直接操作潜在空间实现更有效的偏见缓解。

Abstract: Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall
text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level
demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept
representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a
model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational
biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention
attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g.,
gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into
representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of
these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept
entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that
remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we
further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion
sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected
SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness
interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to
disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate
concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional
bias mitigation.

Motivation: 现有图像标注工具需要先上传预收集的数据集，无法支持实时数据采集和按需标注，这在实验室实时仪器数据采集场景中尤为不便

Method: 开发基于Python的图形用户界面，集成OpenCV和Numpy等高性能库，支持多种视频设备连接，提供类似商业图形软件的标注工具（包括贝塞尔曲线、二进制掩码和非破坏性图层）

Conclusion: LivePyxel简化了数据收集和标注流程，加速了实验工作流中AI模型的开发，解决了科学领域AI模型部署中的标注工具灵活性不足问题

Abstract: The lack of flexible annotation tools has hindered the deployment of AI
models in some scientific areas. Most existing image annotation software
requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for
on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This
constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where
real-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly
common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical
user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams,
microscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is
designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to
precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial
graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of
B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with
non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also
integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for
object detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with
high-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra
operations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data
collection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in
experimental workflows. LivePyxel freely available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DEFT-VTON方法，通过Doob's h-transform高效微调和自适应一致性损失，在仅训练1.42%参数的情况下实现高质量虚拟试穿，推理步骤减少到15步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中虚拟试穿需要有限训练和推理预算，现有方法需要大量端到端训练，成本过高。

Method: 冻结预训练模型参数，训练小型h-transform网络学习条件变换；结合一致性损失和去噪分数匹配损失进行自适应微调。

Result: 在虚拟试穿任务上达到最先进性能，仅需15步去噪步骤，保持竞争性结果。

Conclusion: DEFT-VTON方法以极低的参数训练成本和推理成本实现了高质量的虚拟试穿效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their
established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end
training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods,
real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference,
serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply
Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained
unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT
freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform
network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows
training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of
5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
  To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference
time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency
training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one
while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference
path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine
the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive
manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results
show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO
tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive
results.

order to improve pedestrian recognition. We provide a pipeline for augmentation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法架构复杂且可解释性有限，而现有KAN网络会破坏图像的空间结构特征，需要开发专门针对图像处理的可解释神经网络框架

Method: 基于函数空间推广Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理，使用Hermite函数的傅里叶分解学习内部函数，提出FunKAN用于图像增强和U-FunKAN用于医学图像分割

Result: 在IXI数据集上有效抑制MRI吉布斯伪影，在BUSI、GlaS、CVC-ClinicDB三个医学数据集上实现最先进的二值分割性能，在PSNR、TV、IoU、F1等指标上优于其他KAN方法

Conclusion: 该工作填补了理论函数逼近与医学图像分析之间的空白，为临床应用提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Medical image enhancement and segmentation are critical yet challenging tasks
in modern clinical practice, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical
variations. Traditional deep learning approaches often rely on complex
architectures with limited interpretability. While Kolmogorov-Arnold networks
offer interpretable solutions, their reliance on flattened feature
representations fundamentally disrupts the intrinsic spatial structure of
imaging data. To address this issue we propose a Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (FunKAN) -- a novel interpretable neural framework, designed
specifically for image processing, that formally generalizes the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces and learns
inner functions using Fourier decomposition over the basis Hermite functions.
We explore FunKAN on several medical image processing tasks, including Gibbs
ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images, benchmarking on IXI dataset.
We also propose U-FunKAN as state-of-the-art binary medical segmentation model
with benchmarks on three medical datasets: BUSI (ultrasound images), GlaS
(histological structures) and CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy videos), detecting
breast cancer, glands and polyps, respectively. Experiments on those diverse
datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other KAN-based backbones in
both medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1). Our work
bridges the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image
analysis, offering a robust, interpretable solution for clinical applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态方法通常忽视仇恨内容的决定性作用，对所有内容一视同仁，且无法系统捕捉视频中的结构化信息，限制了多模态融合效果。

Method: 构建实例图将视频分割为多个实例提取特征，使用互补权重图为特征分配重要性权重以突出仇恨实例，结合权重和特征生成视频标签。

Result: 在公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在仇恨视频分类方面达到最先进水平，并具有很强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态双流图神经网络模型有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在仇恨视频检测方面表现出色且具有解释性。

Abstract: Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world
well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal
classification approaches integrating information from several modalities
outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful
content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all
content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally,
existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured
information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph
neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given
video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a
complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features,
highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are
combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to
systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities.
Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is
state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

Conclusion: 虽然完整轨迹的三维重建仍然具有挑战性，但ColonCrafter展示了在临床相关应用中的潜力，包括3D点云生成和表面覆盖评估。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) scene understanding in colonoscopy presents
significant challenges that necessitate automated methods for accurate depth
estimation. However, existing depth estimation models for endoscopy struggle
with temporal consistency across video sequences, limiting their applicability
for 3D reconstruction. We present ColonCrafter, a diffusion-based depth
estimation model that generates temporally consistent depth maps from monocular
colonoscopy videos. Our approach learns robust geometric priors from synthetic
colonoscopy sequences to generate temporally consistent depth maps. We also
introduce a style transfer technique that preserves geometric structure while
adapting real clinical videos to match our synthetic training domain.
ColonCrafter achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the C3VD
dataset, outperforming both general-purpose and endoscopy-specific approaches.
Although full trajectory 3D reconstruction remains a challenge, we demonstrate
clinically relevant applications of ColonCrafter, including 3D point cloud
generation and surface coverage assessment.

Result: 在公开数据集上的定量和定性评估证明了方法的有效性，减少了GPU内存使用同时提升了渲染质量

Conclusion: 该方法在保持系统运行性能的同时，显著降低了GPU内存使用并提高了渲染质量，特别适用于计算资源有限的嵌入式平台

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made a significant
impact on rendering and reconstruction techniques. Current research
predominantly focuses on improving rendering performance and reconstruction
quality using high-performance desktop GPUs, largely overlooking applications
for embedded platforms like micro air vehicles (MAVs). These devices, with
their limited computational resources and memory, often face a trade-off
between system performance and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we
improve existing methods in terms of GPU memory usage while enhancing rendering
quality. Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we
propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces
GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore,
rendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via
Patch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire
scene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.

Conclusion: 该框架为实现可靠的驾驶感知自主性提供了实用路径，能够有效处理复杂驾驶环境中的分布偏移问题

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably
face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where
rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD)
cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on
computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation,
trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study
formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing
formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms
[1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces
adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving
environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals
that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit
mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific
dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves
substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates.
Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show
that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD
approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical
path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.

Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern as it has a significant impact
on global carbon emissions and biodiversity. In this paper, we present a method
for detecting deforestation in the Amazon using image pairs from Earth

annotates the detected changes with relevant keywords. The candidate annotation
for images are extracted from scientific documents related to the Amazon
region. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of Amazon image pairs and

relevant annotations. Our method provides a useful tool for monitoring and
studying the impact of deforestation in the Amazon. While we focus on
environment applications of our work by using images of deforestation in the

it is generic enough to be applied to other domains.

Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP,
Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our
championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer
competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against
outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against
erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an
alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which
candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this
paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization,
specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP,
RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely
applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise

Conclusion: SAMIR框架通过利用SAM的强大表征学习能力，在不依赖弱监督标签的情况下实现了更准确的医学图像注册，为医学图像分析领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis.
Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of
tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised
methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as
segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function.
However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their
practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of
visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical
image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image
datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather
than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline
using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings,
enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation
patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the
embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images.
Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide
coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration
and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance
improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code
will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Accurate identification of deforestation from satellite images is essential
in order to understand the geographical situation of an area. This paper
introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate
deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated
Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model
while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our
framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for
local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized
training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data
security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY
framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient
client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to
create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision
Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN
with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available
datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image
segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.

Abstract: Estimating metric relative camera pose from a pair of images is of great
importance for 3D reconstruction and localisation. However, conventional
two-view pose estimation methods are not metric, with camera translation known
only up to a scale, and struggle with wide baselines and textureless or
reflective surfaces. This paper introduces GARPS, a training-free framework
that casts this problem as the direct alignment of two independently
reconstructed 3D scenes. GARPS leverages a metric monocular depth estimator and
a Gaussian scene reconstructor to obtain a metric 3D Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) for each image. It then refines an initial pose from a feed-forward
two-view pose estimator by optimising a differentiable GMM alignment objective.
This objective jointly considers geometric structure, view-independent colour,
anisotropic covariance, and semantic feature consistency, and is robust to
occlusions and texture-poor regions without requiring explicit 2D
correspondences. Extensive experiments on the Real\-Estate10K dataset
demonstrate that GARPS outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art
learning-based methods, including MASt3R. These results highlight the potential
of bridging single-view perception with multi-view geometry to achieve robust
and metric relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: 查找网络通过查找表操作成功实现了高效率和低能耗，在多种任务和数据类型上都达到了最先进的性能

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with
different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these
operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and
usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than
other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks
on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated
operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost.
Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup
operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural
networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation
values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their
responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we
construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several
training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally
expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop
lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point
cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can
benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of
energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive
performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that
our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks
(both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both
images and point clouds).

Method: 提出一种新的语义视觉投影器，利用SAM生成的语义超像素识别"视觉单词"，通过压缩和投影语义超像素作为视觉轴，并使用语义超像素位置嵌入和聚合器来减少信息损失

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义超像素实现了高效的视觉轴压缩，在保持语义信息的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度，为MLLM在分割任务中的应用提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is
computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe
that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance
between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity,
often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops.
Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that
leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in
an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens,
our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene
complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of
information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to
strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a
semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside
superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts
visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM
training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual
projectors on RIS.

Conclusion: FishBEV通过专门针对鱼眼相机特性的创新设计，有效解决了畸变、多视角对应和时间动态等挑战，为鱼眼相机的BEV分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As a cornerstone technique for autonomous driving, Bird's Eye View (BEV)
segmentation has recently achieved remarkable progress with pinhole cameras.
However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras
with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and
unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance.
To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation
framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces
three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale
Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while
preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention
(U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view
alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that
adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal
coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that
FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance
evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了三种基于样条的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)方法（SBTAYLOR-KAN、SBRBF-KAN、SBWAVELET-KAN），用于医学图像分类。这些模型在有限的数据集上实现了高精度分类，仅需少量参数，适用于资源受限的临床环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限临床环境中医学图像分类的挑战，特别是在数据量少、多样化的情况下实现准确且可解释的分类。传统CNN模型需要数百万参数，不适合资源约束的医疗环境。

Method: 提出三种样条基KANs模型：SBTAYLOR-KAN（B样条+泰勒级数）、SBRBF-KAN（B样条+径向基函数）、SBWAVELET-KAN（B样条+Morlet小波变换）。利用样条基函数近似捕捉局部和全局非线性。在脱脑MRI、胸部X光片等四种医学图像上进行评估，使用Grad-CAM实现可解释性。

Result: SBTAYLOR-KAN达到最98.93%的最高准确率，仅使用2,872个可训练参数（较ResNet50的24.18M参数大大减少）。在仅使用30%训练数据时仍保持86%以上准确率。在类不平衡的皮肤癌数据集上达到68.22%准确率，表现优于其他模型。模型显示了强大的普适性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级、可解释、具有良好普适性的医学图像分类方案，有效解决了临床AI应用中数据量少和数据稀缺场景下的挑战。

Abstract: Effective and interpretable classification of medical images is a challenge
in computer-aided diagnosis, especially in resource-limited clinical settings.
This study introduces spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for
accurate medical image classification with limited, diverse datasets. The
models include SBTAYLOR-KAN, integrating B-splines with Taylor series;
SBRBF-KAN, combining B-splines with Radial Basis Functions; and SBWAVELET-KAN,
embedding B-splines in Morlet wavelet transforms. These approaches leverage
spline-based function approximation to capture both local and global
nonlinearities. The models were evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays,
tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing,
demonstrating the ability to learn directly from raw data. Extensive
experiments, including cross-dataset validation and data reduction analysis,
showed strong generalization and stability. SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93%
accuracy, with a balanced F1-score, maintaining over 86% accuracy using only
30% of the training data across three datasets. Despite class imbalance in the
skin cancer dataset, experiments on both imbalanced and balanced versions
showed SBTAYLOR-KAN outperforming other models, achieving 68.22% accuracy.
Unlike traditional CNNs, which require millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet50
with 24.18M), SBTAYLOR-KAN achieves comparable performance with just 2,872
trainable parameters, making it more suitable for constrained medical
environments. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used
for interpretability, highlighting relevant regions in medical images. This
framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for
medical image classification, addressing the challenges of limited datasets and
data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出StyleProtect方法，通过更新选择性跨注意力层来保护艺术作品元价的艺术风格，防止被微调模型仿制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的发展，恶意使用者可以便捷地仿制艺术家的创作风格，导致保护艺术作品元价的需求日益增长。

Method: 发现某些跨注意力层对艺术风格特别敏感，通过测量注意力层激活强度和特征相关性来识别关键层，然后仅更新选定的跨注意力层来实现保护。

Result: 在WikiArt和Anita动画数据集上进行实验，方法能够有效防御微调模型的风格仿制，同时保持良好的隐藏性。

Conclusion: StyleProtect提供了一种高效轻量的艺术作品保护策略，通过目标性地修改模型的关键组件来防止风格仿制。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based
approaches, has inadvertently facilitated their potential for misuse. Such
models enable malicious exploiters to replicate artistic styles that capture an
artist's creative labor, personal vision, and years of dedication in an
inexpensive manner. This has led to a rise in the need and exploration of
methods for protecting artworks against style mimicry. Although generic
diffusion models can easily mimic an artistic style, finetuning amplifies this
capability, enabling the model to internalize and reproduce the style with
higher fidelity and control. We hypothesize that certain cross-attention layers
exhibit heightened sensitivity to artistic styles. Sensitivity is measured
through activation strengths of attention layers in response to style and
content representations, and assessing their correlations with features
extracted from external models. Based on our findings, we introduce an
efficient and lightweight protection strategy, StyleProtect, that achieves
effective style defense against fine-tuned diffusion models by updating only
selected cross-attention layers. Our experiments utilize a carefully curated
artwork dataset based on WikiArt, comprising representative works from 30
artists known for their distinctive and influential styles and cartoon
animations from the Anita dataset. The proposed method demonstrates promising
performance in safeguarding unique styles of artworks and anime from malicious
diffusion customization, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督单目深度估计方法在低纹理或动态区域存在不确定性，导致深度精度下降，需要解决这些挑战性问题。

Method: 采用师生训练策略，将不确定性估计嵌入训练流程和网络架构中，仅在教师网络训练时使用光流，避免额外标注和运行时成本。

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在自监督深度和姿态估计方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UM-Depth框架通过不确定性感知细化有效提升了深度估计精度，特别是在具有挑战性的场景区域，同时保持了推理效率。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has been increasingly adopted in robotics and
autonomous driving for its ability to infer scene geometry from a single
camera. In self-supervised monocular depth estimation frameworks, the network
jointly generates and exploits depth and pose estimates during training,
thereby eliminating the need for depth labels. However, these methods remain
challenged by uncertainty in the input data, such as low-texture or dynamic
regions, which can cause reduced depth accuracy. To address this, we introduce
UM-Depth, a framework that combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to
enhance depth accuracy at dynamic object boundaries and in textureless regions.
Specifically, we develop a teacherstudent training strategy that embeds
uncertainty estimation into both the training pipeline and network
architecture, thereby strengthening supervision where photometric signals are
weak. Unlike prior motion-aware approaches that incur inference-time overhead
and rely on additional labels or auxiliary networks for real-time generation,
our method uses optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during
training, which eliminating extra labeling demands and any runtime cost.
Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware refinement. Overall, UM-Depth achieves
state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on
the KITTI datasets.

Motivation: 解决基于文本静态查询的方法在参照视频对象分割中容易被外观或运动相似的干扰物引导，产生查询选择偏差的问题。

Method: 提出三重查询前置器(TQF)，将参照查询因子化为外观查询、内框交互查询和框间运动查询。动态结合语言符号和视觉指导构建查询，并使用内框交互聚合和框间运动聚合模块增强对象表征。

Result: 在多个RVOS指标上进行了广泛实验，证明了TQF的优势和结构化查询设计及运动意识聚合模块的有效性。

Conclusion: TQF通过结构化查询设计和运动意识聚合，有效解决了查询选择偏差问题，在参照视频对象分割任务中取得了显著成效。

Abstract: Recently, query-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in
Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by using textual static object
queries to drive cross-modal alignment. However, these static queries are
easily misled by distractors with similar appearance or motion, resulting in
\emph{query selection bias}. To address this issue, we propose Triple Query
Former (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized
components: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame
interaction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for
temporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our
queries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and
visual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules
that enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation
incorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame,
while Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment
across frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our
structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立处理GREC和GRES任务，忽视了联合训练的优势，且将GRES视为语义分割任务，忽略了实例感知能力和实例级框掩码一致性预测的重要性。

Method: 提出InstanceVG框架，使用实例查询统一实例级框和掩码的联合一致性预测，为每个实例查询分配先验参考点作为目标匹配的额外基础，实现点、框、掩码的一致性预测。

Result: 在10个数据集4个任务上的大量实验表明，InstanceVG实现了最先进的性能，在各种评估指标上显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: InstanceVG是第一个同时处理GREC和GRES任务并融入实例感知能力的通用视觉定位框架，通过统一的多粒度一致性预测取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Generalized visual grounding tasks, including Generalized Referring
Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES), extend the classical
visual grounding paradigm by accommodating multi-target and non-target
scenarios. Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential
objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve
fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically
treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training
GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline
the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic
segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities
and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level
boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a
multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware
capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and
consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our
knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC
and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized
visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a
prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target
matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and
masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets
across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various
evaluation metrics. The code and model will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Dmmm1997/InstanceVG.

Conclusion: FMFA框架通过全模式细粒度对齐，有效提升了跨模态匹配的准确性，无需额外监督即可实现更好的全局对齐效果。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is a cross-modal matching task that
aims to retrieve the most relevant person images based on a given text query.
The key challenge in TIPR lies in achieving effective alignment between textual
and visual modalities within a common latent space. To address this challenge,
prior approaches incorporate attention mechanisms for implicit cross-modal
local alignment. However, they lack the ability to verify whether all local
features are correctly aligned. Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on
hard negative samples during model updates, with the goal of refining
distinctions between positive and negative pairs, often neglecting incorrectly
matched positive pairs. To alleviate these issues, we propose FMFA, a
cross-modal Full-Mode Fine-grained Alignment framework, which enhances global
matching through explicit fine-grained alignment and existing implicit
relational reasoning -- hence the term ``full-mode" -- without requiring
additional supervision. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Similarity
Distribution Matching (A-SDM) module to rectify unmatched positive sample
pairs. A-SDM adaptively pulls the unmatched positive pairs closer in the joint
embedding space, thereby achieving more precise global alignment. Additionally,
we introduce an Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) module, which makes up
for the lack of verification capability of implicit relational reasoning. EFA
strengthens explicit cross-modal fine-grained interactions by sparsifying the
similarity matrix and employs a hard coding method for local alignment. Our
proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among all global matching methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/yinhao1102/FMFA.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更细粒度、连续和可控的颜色编辑，解决了文本驱动图像编辑中的颜色控制难题

Abstract: In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress.
However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language,
color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and
difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the
embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to
generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise
control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the
relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image
color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a
color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text
embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding
embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of
the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify
a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within
the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and
controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种通过视觉反馈迭代精炼提示的实用方案，有效提升文本到图像生成的安全性，为生成更安全的T2I内容提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating images
from text prompts, but their output quality and safety still depend heavily on
how prompts are phrased. Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using
large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can
result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To
address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses
Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the
generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts
more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and
reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we
introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals
using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs
without compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution
for generating safer T2I content. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有RAW数据处理方法存在两个主要局限：大规模ISP网络计算开销大，基于传统ISP流水线调优的方法表示能力有限。需要一种既能保持丰富RAW信息又能高效处理的方法。

Method: 提出TA-ISP框架，预测一组轻量级多尺度调制算子（全局、区域和像素尺度），通过因子化控制重塑图像统计信息，扩展空间变化变换的表示范围。

Result: 在多个RAW域检测和分割基准测试中（白天和夜间条件），TA-ISP持续提升下游任务精度，同时显著减少参数数量和推理时间。

Conclusion: TA-ISP适合在资源受限设备上部署，为RAW数据处理提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards
exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to
conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing
visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant
information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks
such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still
face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational
overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are
restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we
propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB
framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision
models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small
set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global,
regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial
extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially
varying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage,
computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain
detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime
conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly
reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for
deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by rain streak artifacts in low-light conditions
significantly hampers the performance of nighttime surveillance and autonomous
navigation. Existing image deraining techniques are primarily designed for
daytime conditions and perform poorly under nighttime illumination due to the
spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and the impact of light-dependent
stripe visibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Nighttime Deraining
Location-enhanced Perceptual Network(NDLPNet) that effectively captures the
spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks in
low-light environments. Specifically, we introduce a Position Perception Module
(PPM) to capture and leverage spatial contextual information from input data,
enhancing the model's capability to identify and recalibrate the importance of
different feature channels. The proposed nighttime deraining network can
effectively remove the rain streaks as well as preserve the crucial background
information. Furthermore, We construct a night scene rainy (NSR) dataset
comprising 900 image pairs, all based on real-world nighttime scenes, providing
a new benchmark for nighttime deraining task research. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experimental evaluations on both existing datasets and the NSR
dataset consistently demonstrate our method outperform the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in nighttime deraining tasks. The source code and dataset is

Conclusion: 集成多模态建模对于准确的声道分析具有重要价值，展示了多模态信息融合在医学图像分割中的优势。

Abstract: Accurately segmenting articulatory structures in real-time magnetic resonance
imaging (rtMRI) remains challenging, as most existing methods rely almost
entirely on visual cues. Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals
provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve
precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that
integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion
for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation,
we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation
performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated
on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance
(HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines.
Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive
learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the
value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.

Motivation: 随着生成技术的发展，视觉内容包含自然和AI生成图像的复杂混合，传统编解码器和学习方法难以在高压缩比下保持主观质量，现有生成方法面临视觉保真度和泛化性挑战

Method: 使用预优化编码器生成广义压缩域表示，通过轻量级适配器和注意力融合模块与预训练模型内部特征集成，引入分布重归一化方法增强重建保真度

Result: 在低码率下视觉保真度优于现有方法，压缩性能比H.266/VVC提升高达79%，为AI生成内容提供高效解决方案且可适应更广泛内容类型

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用现有预训练扩散模型，能以最小重训练成本适应不同预训练模型的新需求，在低码率压缩方面表现出色

Abstract: As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex
mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient
coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and
learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression
ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity
and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework
leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates.
Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized
compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's
internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module.
This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and
enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new
requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution
renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive
experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual
fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79%
over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content
while being adaptable to broader content types.

TL;DR: AdaThinkDrive是一个新颖的视觉语言动作框架，采用双模式推理机制（快速/慢速思考），通过自适应选择是否使用思维链推理来平衡自动驾驶决策的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链推理技术在简单场景中表现不佳，引入不必要的计算开销却未能提升决策质量，需要一种自适应机制来区分不同场景的推理需求。

Method: 1) 在大规模自动驾驶场景上进行预训练，获取世界知识和驾驶常识；2) 监督微调时引入双模式数据集（快速回答和慢速思考）；3) 提出自适应思维奖励策略与GRPO结合，通过比较不同推理模式的轨迹质量来奖励模型选择性应用CoT。

Conclusion: AdaThinkDrive通过自适应推理机制有效平衡了准确性和效率，在自动驾驶任务中实现了更好的性能表现和计算效率。

Abstract: While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely
adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising
capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to
integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing
unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To
address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode
reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is
pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question
answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving
commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode
dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the
model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an
Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively
applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes.
Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves
a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points.
Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and
always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also
reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline,
demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive
reasoning.

Result: 大量实验证明了每个模块在提高偶变定位的准确性和稳健性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部-全局协同预测和智能融合策略，有效解决了深度假定位中的关键挑战，为精确定位撰改区域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While the pursuit of higher accuracy in deepfake detection remains a central
goal, there is an increasing demand for precise localization of manipulated
regions. Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based
detection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge.
A common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model
training alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect
the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting
in suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is
the fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the
outputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining
the effectiveness of the localization.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently
predicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives. We
employ morphological operations to fuse the outputs, effectively suppressing
noise while enhancing spatial coherence. Extensive experiments reveal the
effectiveness of each module in improving the accuracy and robustness of
forgery localization.

Motivation: 解决事件相机处理中存在的两大问题：中间表示引入的窗口延迟，以及点级检测方法的高计算成本影响实时性。

Method: 设计轻量因果空间邻域编码器捕捉局部几何关系，继而使用Mamba基于状态空间模型进行线性复杂度的时间建模，通过控制器根据事件率动态调整处理速度。

Result: 方法能够在不依赖预定义时间窗口的情况下直接处理原始事件流，实现低延迟和高效率的实时处理。

Conclusion: 该方法为高速视觉任务提供了一种无窗口延迟、计算高效的新方案，适应性地平衡了窗口延迟和推理延迟。

Abstract: Event cameras capture asynchronous pixel-level brightness changes with
microsecond temporal resolution, offering unique advantages for high-speed
vision tasks. Existing methods often convert event streams into intermediate
representations such as frames, voxel grids, or point clouds, which inevitably
require predefined time windows and thus introduce window latency. Meanwhile,
pointwise detection methods face computational challenges that prevent
real-time efficiency due to their high computational cost. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel
architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate
representations. Our method introduces a lightweight causal spatial
neighborhood encoder to efficiently capture local geometric relations, followed
by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear
complexity. During inference, a controller adaptively adjusts the processing
speed according to the event rate, achieving an optimal balance between window
latency and inference latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BWCache是一种无需训练的加速方法，通过动态缓存和重用DiT块特征来加速基于DiT的视频生成，在保持视觉质量的同时实现最高2.24倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器(DiT)在视频生成中虽然是最先进的方法，但其顺序去噪过程导致不可避免的延迟，限制了实际应用。现有加速方法要么因架构修改而损害视觉质量，要么无法在适当粒度上重用中间特征。

Method: 提出Block-Wise Caching (BWCache)方法，动态缓存和重用跨扩散时间步的DiT块特征。引入相似性指示器，仅在相邻时间步块特征差异低于阈值时触发特征重用，从而最小化冗余计算。

Result: 在多个视频扩散模型上的广泛实验表明，BWCache实现了最高2.24倍的加速，同时保持可比较的视觉质量。

Conclusion: BWCache是一种有效的训练免费加速方法，通过智能特征重用显著减少了DiT块的计算冗余，为实时视频生成应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as
the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently
sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world
applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality
due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at
proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary
contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature
variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during
intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In
this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to
accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses
features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce
a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences
between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby
minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves
up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

Motivation: 解决航天器姿态估计中合成数据到真实数据的域适应问题，现有无监督方法在少量标注目标数据可用时表现不佳，需要更有效的监督域自适应方案。

Method: 基于学习不变表示和风险(LIRR)范式，联合使用标注的合成数据和有限的标注真实数据，同时优化域不变表示和任务特定风险。

Result: 在SPEED+基准测试中一致优于源域训练、微调和全标注基线，仅用5%标注目标数据即可匹配或超越使用更多标注数据的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量级、主干网络无关且计算高效，为实际空间环境中鲁棒可部署的航天器姿态估计提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE) is a fundamental capability for autonomous
space operations such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing. Hybrid
pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on
synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or
lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap.
Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue
but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are
available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation
(SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning
Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes
domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled
synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error
under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle
baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or
surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The
framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient,
offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose
estimation in real-world space environments.

Abstract: Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization systems have been
extensively investigated for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied
environments. However, existing retrieval-based approaches face limitations in
dataset availability and persistent challenges including suboptimal real-time
performance, environmental sensitivity, and limited generalization capability,
particularly in dynamic or temporally varying environments. To overcome these

Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF) method. This approach integrates robust
semantic features from both UAV-captured images and satellite imagery through
two key innovations: a semantic weighting mechanism and an optimized particle
filtering architecture. Evaluated using our dataset, the proposed method
achieves 10x computational efficiency gain over feature extraction methods,
maintains global positioning errors below 10 meters, and enables rapid 4 degree

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在提升特征判别性方面有效，但掩码建模方法在无监督域自适应语义分割中仍未充分探索，主要由于架构不兼容和优化目标不一致。

Method: 在特征空间执行特征掩码和重建，引入轻量级Rebuilder模块进行联合训练（推理时丢弃），利用分割解码器对重建特征进行分类，确保辅助目标与像素级预测任务紧密耦合。

Result: 在不同架构和UDA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MFM能持续提升分割性能。

Conclusion: MFM为无监督域自适应语义分割提供了一种简单、高效且可推广的策略。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to
transfer models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.
While auxiliary self-supervised tasks-particularly contrastive learning-have
improved feature discriminability, masked modeling approaches remain
underexplored in this setting, largely due to architectural incompatibility and
misaligned optimization objectives. We propose Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), a
novel auxiliary task that performs feature masking and reconstruction directly
in the feature space. Unlike existing masked modeling methods that reconstruct
low-level inputs or perceptual features (e.g., HOG or visual tokens), MFM
aligns its learning target with the main segmentation task, ensuring
compatibility with standard architectures like DeepLab and DAFormer without
modifying the inference pipeline. To facilitate effective reconstruction, we
introduce a lightweight auxiliary module, Rebuilder, which is trained jointly
but discarded during inference, adding zero computational overhead at test
time. Crucially, MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the
reconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the
pixel-wise prediction task to avoid interference with the primary task.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks
demonstrate that MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance, offering a
simple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 虽然1D-Justo-LiuNet是目前光谱分类的最先进模型，但在训练数据有限时性能会下降。需要寻找对有限数据更鲁棒的替代方法。

Method: 研究使用MiniROCKET和HDC-MiniROCKET进行光谱分类，这些模型在特征提取部分没有可训练参数，通过精心设计的特征提取来应对有限数据问题。

Result: MiniROCKET在有限数据场景下优于1D-Justo-LiuNet，在一般情况下性能相当，尽管参数更多但对训练数据需求更少。

Conclusion: MiniROCKET系列模型是光谱分类中处理有限训练数据问题的有效解决方案，为未来空间-光谱方法的改进提供了补充。

Abstract: The classification of pixel spectra of hyperspectral images, i.e. spectral
classification, is used in many fields ranging from agricultural, over medical
to remote sensing applications and is currently also expanding to areas such as
autonomous driving. Even though for full hyperspectral images the
best-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing
classification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g.
smaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral
information is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either
part can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future.
Recently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with
very few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral
classification. However, we show that with limited training data the model
performance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and
HDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model
extracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature
extraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We
show that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms
1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the
general case

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has been employed to alleviate the need for
extensive labeled data for histopathology image segmentation, but existing
methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels due to ambiguous gland boundaries and
morphological misclassification. This paper introduces Semi-MOE, to the best of
our knowledge, the first multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework for
semi-supervised histopathology image segmentation. Our approach leverages three
specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance
field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to
capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating
Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a
robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate
manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we
propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss. Extensive experiments on GlaS and
CRAG benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
low-label settings, highlighting the potential of MoE-based architectures in

Result: 评估确认编码器具有独特的幻觉特征，VisionWeaver能显著减少幻觉并提升整体模型性能

Conclusion: 视觉编码器的选择对减少LVLM幻觉至关重要，VisionWeaver通过动态特征聚合有效解决了物体幻觉问题

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly
impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately
interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We
hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual
encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their
diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on
coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse
hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these
effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately
10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination
categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination
characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple
feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network.
It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically
aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive
experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing
hallucinations and improving overall model performance.

Abstract: Many recent approaches in representation learning implicitly assume that
uncorrelated views of a data point are sufficient to learn meaningful
representations for various downstream tasks. In this work, we challenge this
assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does
not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a
method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align
complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments
show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View
Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical
role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations. Our
method achieved first and second place in the MICCAI 2025 SSL3D challenge when
using a Primus vision transformer and ResEnc convolutional neural network,

*Jiayi Pan,Jiaming Xu,Yongkang Zhou,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecDiff是一种基于自推测信息的训练免费多级特征缓存策略，通过引入未来信息来克服现有特征缓存方法仅依赖历史信息导致的性能限制，在保持质量的同时实现了显著的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法仅依赖历史信息，导致精度和速度性能受限。需要引入未来信息来突破速度-精度权衡的瓶颈。

Method: 提出自推测范式，基于不同迭代次数相同时间步的信息相似性引入未来信息。包括基于自推测信息的缓存特征选择算法和多级特征分类算法。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3、3.5和FLUX上分别实现了2.80×、2.74×和3.17×的平均加速，质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 通过融合推测信息和历史信息，SpecDiff突破了速度-精度权衡的瓶颈，推动了高效扩散模型推理的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion
model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused
by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference
process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature
caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out
that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy
and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future
information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the
same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we
present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy
including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature
classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on
self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance
score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical
information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance
score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature
importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the
differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature
calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff}
achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with
negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow
on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information,
\textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing
the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model
inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDITS是一个新的数据集蒸馏框架，利用图像中的隐含文本语义来提升蒸馏效果，通过视觉语言模型和大型语言模型融合图像特征和文本信息，最终使用扩散模型生成合成数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法主要捕获低级视觉特征，忽略了图像中的高级语义和结构信息，导致蒸馏效果有限。

Method: 1. 使用视觉语言模型生成外部文本并与图像特征融合；2. 通过全局语义查询模块形成先验聚类缓冲区；3. 局部语义感知选择代表性样本构建图像和文本原型；4. 使用精心设计的提示词引导大型语言模型；5. 通过双原型指导策略和扩散模型生成最终合成数据集。

Result: 大量实验证实了该方法的有效性，在保持竞争性模型性能的同时实现了高效学习。

Conclusion: EDITS框架通过利用图像中的文本语义信息，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的效果，为高效学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact dataset from the original
large-scale one, enabling highly efficient learning while preserving
competitive model performance. However, traditional techniques primarily
capture low-level visual features, neglecting the high-level semantic and
structural information inherent in images. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a
novel framework that exploits the implicit textual semantics within the image
data to achieve enhanced distillation. First, external texts generated by a
Vision Language Model (VLM) are fused with image features through a Global
Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic
Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct
image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language
Model (LLM) with meticulously crafted prompt. Ultimately, Dual Prototype
Guidance strategy generates the final synthetic dataset through a diffusion
model. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.Source

TL;DR: LamiGauss是一种结合高斯溅射辐射光栅化和专用探测器到世界变换模型的CL重建算法，能够在稀疏投影条件下实现高质量重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT在板状结构检测中存在几何约束问题，而CL在稀疏视图采集条件下的高质量体积重建仍然具有挑战性

Method: 使用高斯溅射辐射光栅化技术，结合包含层析倾斜角的专用探测器到世界变换模型，采用初始化策略过滤常见层析伪影

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，仅使用3%的完整视图就能达到优于在全数据集上优化的迭代方法的性能

Conclusion: LamiGauss能够直接从稀疏投影进行有效优化，在有限数据条件下实现准确高效的重建

Abstract: X-ray Computed Laminography (CL) is essential for non-destructive inspection
of plate-like structures in applications such as microchips and composite
battery materials, where traditional computed tomography (CT) struggles due to
geometric constraints. However, reconstructing high-quality volumes from
laminographic projections remains challenging, particularly under highly
sparse-view acquisition conditions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction
algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative
rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model
incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an
initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic
artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians
from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model
capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes
directly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient
reconstruction with limited data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
method over existing techniques. LamiGauss uses only 3$\%$ of full views to
achieve superior performance over the iterative method optimized on a full
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于内存的视频分割方法（如SAM2）在分割任务中表现优异，但在视觉目标跟踪中面对干扰物（外观相似的目标）时存在挑战，需要专门针对干扰物问题的解决方案。

Method: 提出了干扰物感知的即插即用内存模块和基于自省的内存管理方法，构建了DiDi干扰物蒸馏数据集用于分析跟踪性能。

Result: 在13个基准测试中超越SAM2.1，在10个测试中达到新的SOTA；集成到实时跟踪器EfficientTAM中提升11%性能，与EdgeTAM集成提升4%性能，展现出良好的架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAM4SAM模块有效解决了跟踪中的干扰物问题，显著提升了跟踪性能，并且具有良好的通用性和可移植性，可以集成到不同的跟踪架构中。

Abstract: Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has
led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving
leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully
adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually
similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a
distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management
method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the
tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after
object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of
distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM
outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results
on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a
real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking
quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation
benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4%
performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨盆骨折在标准X光片中常常难以诊断，特别是当骨折迹象细微或不可见时，需要开发更精确的检测方法来提高诊断准确性。

Method: 提出PelFANet双流注意力网络，融合原始X光片和分割骨图像，使用Fused Attention Blocks迭代交换和精炼特征，采用两阶段分割引导的训练流程。

Result: 在AMERI数据集上，可见骨折准确率88.68%，AUC 0.9334；不可见骨折准确率82.29%，AUC 0.8688，尽管未针对不可见骨折进行训练。

Conclusion: 解剖感知的双输入架构在骨盆骨折检测方面具有显著临床潜力，特别是在放射学表现细微的情况下表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pelvic fractures pose significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in
cases where fracture signs are subtle or invisible on standard radiographs. To
address this, we introduce PelFANet, a dual-stream attention network that fuses
raw pelvic X-rays with segmented bone images to improve fracture
classification. The network em-ploys Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks) to
iteratively exchange and refine fea-tures from both inputs, capturing global
context and localized anatomical detail. Trained in a two-stage pipeline with a
segmentation-guided approach, PelFANet demonstrates superior performance over
conventional methods. On the AMERI dataset, it achieves 88.68% accuracy and
0.9334 AUC on visible fractures, while generalizing effectively to invisible
fracture cases with 82.29% accuracy and 0.8688 AUC, despite not being trained
on them. These results highlight the clini-cal potential of anatomy-aware
dual-input architectures for robust fracture detec-tion, especially in
scenarios with subtle radiographic presentations.

TL;DR: EvHand-FPV是一个轻量级单事件相机第一人称视角3D手部追踪框架，通过手腕ROI定位、端到端映射和多任务学习策略，在保持高精度的同时大幅减少计算量和参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式方法在精度、延迟和能效方面难以满足XR设备的需求，而事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率和毫瓦级功耗的优势，但缺乏第一人称视角的基准数据集。

Method: 构建事件相机FPV数据集（合成3D标签+真实2D标签），引入手腕ROI几何定位、端到端映射嵌入ROI偏移减少计算，以及多任务学习辅助几何特征头提升表征能力。

Result: 在真实FPV测试集上，2D-AUCp从0.77提升到0.85，参数减少89%（11.2M→1.2M），计算量减少89%（1.648G→0.185G FLOPs），合成数据上保持0.84的3D-AUCp。

Conclusion: EvHand-FPV实现了准确高效的第一人称视角事件手部追踪，适合设备端XR应用，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Hand tracking holds great promise for intuitive interaction paradigms, but
frame-based methods often struggle to meet the requirements of accuracy, low
latency, and energy efficiency, especially in resource-constrained settings
such as Extended Reality (XR) devices. Event cameras provide $\mu$s-level
temporal resolution at mW-level power by asynchronously sensing brightness
changes. In this work, we present EvHand-FPV, a lightweight framework for
egocentric First-Person-View 3D hand tracking from a single event camera. We
construct an event-based FPV dataset that couples synthetic training data with
3D labels and real event data with 2D labels for evaluation to address the
scarcity of egocentric benchmarks. EvHand-FPV also introduces a wrist-based
region of interest (ROI) that localizes the hand region via geometric cues,
combined with an end-to-end mapping strategy that embeds ROI offsets into the
network to reduce computation without explicit reconstruction, and a multi-task
learning strategy with an auxiliary geometric feature head that improves
representations without test-time overhead. On our real FPV test set,
EvHand-FPV improves 2D-AUCp from 0.77 to 0.85 while reducing parameters from
11.2M to 1.2M by 89% and FLOPs per inference from 1.648G to 0.185G by 89%. It
also maintains a competitive 3D-AUCp of 0.84 on synthetic data. These results
demonstrate accurate and efficient egocentric event-based hand tracking
suitable for on-device XR applications. The dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出WARM模块，通过白化和着色变换解决少样本3D点云分割中可学习原型标记与支持特征之间的分布差异问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本3D点云分割方法使用传统算法（如最远点采样）构建原型，但初始随机性严重影响性能，且原型生成过程研究不足。注意力机制虽有潜力，但存在分布差异问题。

Method: 提出White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM)，在白化和着色变换之间插入交叉注意力机制。白化将支持特征与原型标记对齐，注意力处理后着色恢复原始分布，从而生成更具代表性的原型。

Result: 在多个少样本3D点云分割基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WARM模块通过简单的白化-注意力-着色设计有效解决了分布对齐问题，能够捕获支持特征间的语义关系，生成高质量原型，提升少样本分割性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point
labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To
extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing
methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as
farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness
significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation
process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to
investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention
mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the
distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features.
To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM),
which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between
whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the
support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and
subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended
tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby
generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships
among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a
significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答中表现出色，但存在理性与生成答案不一致的问题，导致推理不连贯和错误响应。

Method: 1) 轻量级理性微调修改响应格式；2) 搜索多样化候选响应；3) 使用R-Scorer进行配对评分；4) 基于置信度加权的偏好微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了LVLMs的感知、推理和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 理性导向的对齐校准对于挖掘LVLMs潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have manifested strong visual question
answering capability. However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale
and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect
responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration
(SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and
answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning"
approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale
before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a
diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample,
followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring
model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of
candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC
decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner,
leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and
generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the
rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了AntiPure方法，通过颗率指导和时间步指导机制，在保持图像质量的同时有效抵御净化攻击，使保护性干扰在净化后仍能导致恶意编辑的图像失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防护性干扰能够减少图像被激流模型恶意使用的风险，但现有方法容易被净化技术移除，需要一种能够抵御净化攻击的新方法。

Method: 提出AntiPure方法，包含两种指导机制：1)表面块颗率指导，减少模型对高频组件的控制；2)错误时间步指导，打乱去噪策略。通过这些机制嵌入微小的对抗性干扰。

Result: 实验结果显示AntiPure在净化-自定制流程中表现最佳，实现了最小的视觉差异和最大的失真效果，超越了其他保护性干扰方法。

Conclusion: AntiPure作为一种净化压力测试，有效地曝露了净化技术的漏洞，为防止激流模型被恶意使用提供了更强大的保护手段。

Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual
synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also
introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright
infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation
emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial
noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby
exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we
formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder
existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation
named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the
"purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)
Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over
high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep
Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different
timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible
perturbations that persist under representative purification settings,
achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a
stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy
and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods
within the purification-customization workflow.

Conclusion: NLG方法在保持计算效率的同时与现有指导方法无缝集成，为扩散模型提供了实用且可扩展的增强方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However,
the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the
final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence.
Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset
construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization,
limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance
(NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that
refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with
general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks,
or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework
generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models,
accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments
on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output
generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating
with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our
method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion
models. Code can be found at

Motivation: 当前视觉计数模型在复杂场景中对特定类型物体进行细粒度、意图驱动的计数能力尚不明确，需要专门的评估基准来诊断和改进现有模型。

Method: 构建包含681张高分辨率图像的PairTally数据集，每张图像包含两个物体类别（跨类别和类别内设置），对多种最先进模型进行基准测试，包括基于示例的方法、语言提示模型和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 尽管近期有所进展，但当前模型在可靠地计数用户意图方面仍然存在困难，特别是在细粒度和视觉模糊的情况下表现不佳。

Conclusion: PairTally为诊断和改进细粒度视觉计数系统提供了新的基础，揭示了现有模型在选择性计数能力方面的局限性。

Abstract: Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users
need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent
models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language
models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform
fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we
introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate
fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in
PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and
count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The
dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category
(closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous
evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of
state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted
models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current
models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained
and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for
diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法主要关注密集或全局对齐，缺乏对对象级别多模态语义的有效传递。需要一种能够在不需要修改教师模型或推理时文本输入的情况下，高效传递区域级语义知识的方法。

Method: 提出MOCHA框架，使用翻译模块将学生特征映射到联合空间，通过双目标损失函数（局部对齐和全局关系一致性）指导学生和翻译器的训练，实现对象级别的跨架构知识蒸馏。

Result: 在四个个性化检测基准测试的少样本场景下，平均得分提升+10.1，紧凑架构达到与大型多模态模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: MOCHA证明了对象级别知识蒸馏的有效性，能够在不依赖文本输入的情况下实现高效的多模态语义传递，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment),
a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal
semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight
vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps
student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and
translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local
alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on
dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling
efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring
textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized
detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over
baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact
architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models,
proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决无人机在复杂视觉环境中检测困难的问题，包括背景杂乱、目标尺度小和伪装效应等挑战，传统检测器在低目标-背景分离性场景中性能下降

Method: 改进YOLO-FEDER FusionNet架构，系统优化训练数据组成（大规模逼真合成数据+少量真实样本）、特征融合策略和多尺度FEDER特征集成，评估不同YOLO骨干网络配置

Result: 最佳配置（YOLOv8l骨干+DWD模块FEDER特征）相比基线：FNR降低39.1个百分点，mAP@0.5提升62.8个百分点

Conclusion: 集成中间FEDER特征结合骨干网络升级能显著提升复杂环境中无人机检测性能，合成数据与真实数据结合的训练策略有效增强模型鲁棒性

Abstract: Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to
background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic
object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes,
their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low
object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work
presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework
that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection
techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration
introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion
strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages
large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of
real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions.
The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically
evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across
multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that
integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades,
contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising
configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER
features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR
reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8
percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.

Result: 在2B和8B参数规模下在多样化图像和视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，在106个数据集上表现优异，在复杂推理基准上取得突破

Conclusion: SAIL-VL2通过三项核心创新实现了卓越的多模态理解能力，为开源社区提供了高效且可扩展的视觉语言基础模型

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM)
for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning. As the successor to
SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B
parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating
strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three
core innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation
pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and
distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training
efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful
pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal
pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that
systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances
extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs.
With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across
106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning
benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass
leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source
models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and
extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.

Abstract: Almost 30% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy
(RP) experience biochemical recurrence (BCR), characterized by increased
prostate specific antigen (PSA) and associated with increased mortality.
Accurate early prediction of BCR, at the time of RP, would contribute to prompt
adaptive clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes. In this work,
we propose prostate cancer BCR prediction via fused multi-modal embeddings
(PROFUSEme), which learns cross-modal interactions of clinical, radiology, and
pathology data, following an intermediate fusion configuration in combination
with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors. Quantitative evaluation of our
proposed approach reveals superior performance, when compared with late fusion
configurations, yielding a mean C-index of 0.861 ($\sigma=0.112$) on the
internal 5-fold nested cross-validation framework, and a C-index of 0.7103 on

Conclusion: Wan-Animate成功地将多个角色动画任务统一到一个框架中，通过创新的技术方法实现了高质量的角色动画生成和替换，并承诺开源模型权重和源代码。

Abstract: We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and
replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can
animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of
the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos.
Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video
to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color
tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon
the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified
input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for
generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic
representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body
motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact
expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high
controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental
integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting
LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while
applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental
results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We
are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多目标跟踪算法忽视低质量视频问题，在真实世界图像退化情况下性能显著下降，需要提升MOT算法在低质量视频场景中的应用能力

Method: 设计三分支架构，利用视觉语言模型提取全局视觉语义信息并与查询向量融合；引入MOT-Adapter适配多目标跟踪任务，VSFM模块提升特征融合效果

Result: 在真实低质量视频场景中验证了方法的有效性和优越性，跟踪性能指标比现有方法提升约8%到20%，同时在常规场景中保持稳健性能

Conclusion: VSE-MOT框架成功解决了低质量视频中的多目标跟踪挑战，通过视觉语义增强显著提升了在真实退化场景中的跟踪性能

Abstract: Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues
inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking
performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore,
advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video
scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the
challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models,
this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking
framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture
that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic
information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to
further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce
the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion
Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic
information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the
efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality
video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing
methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in
conventional scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于DINOv3的零样本异常检测方法AD-DINOv3，通过多模态对比学习和异常感知检查模块，充分利用DINOv3的转移能力，在八个工业和医学数据集上达到或超越最新技术水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DINOv3模型直接用于零样本异常检测时的两大挑战：预训练数据域偏差导致特征对齐问题，以及全局语义偏向导致细微异常被误判为正常前景

Method: 提出AD-DINOv3多模态框架：使用DINOv3作为视觉背骨网络提取patch tokens和CLS token，CLIP文本编码器提供正常/异常提示的嵌入。通过轻量适配器缩小域间距，设计异常感知检查模块(AACM)明确引导CLS token关注异常区域

Result: 在八个工业和医学标准数据集上进行广泛实验，AD-DINOv3均能达到或超越当前最先进方法的性能

Conclusion: AD-DINOv3成为一个通用的零样本异常检测框架，有效解决了DINOv3在异常检测任务中的域偏差和语义偏向问题

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary
novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution.
Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which
performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and
text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have
demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we
are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two
key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and
anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent
bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to
subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects,
rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal
framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a
multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual
backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder
provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain
gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their
representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this
baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module
(AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions
rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability.
Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate
that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注通过对比或协作学习来优化全局预测，但忽视了稳定的段级监督和类感知的跨模态对齐

Method: 1) EMA引导的伪监督框架，通过自适应阈值或top-k选择生成可靠的段级掩码；2) 类感知跨模态一致性(CMA)损失，在可靠的段-类别对上对齐音频和视觉嵌入

Result: 在LLP和UnAV-100数据集上的评估显示，该方法在多个指标上达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 提出的两种策略有效解决了弱监督音视频视频解析中的段级监督和跨模态对齐问题，取得了优异的性能

Abstract: Weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) seeks to detect audible,
visible, and audio-visual events without temporal annotations. Previous work
has emphasized refining global predictions through contrastive or collaborative
learning, but neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware
cross-modal alignment. To address this, we propose two strategies: (1) an
exponential moving average (EMA)-guided pseudo supervision framework that
generates reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k
selection, offering stable temporal guidance beyond video-level labels; and (2)
a class-aware cross-modal agreement (CMA) loss that aligns audio and visual
embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs, ensuring consistency across
modalities while preserving temporal structure. Evaluations on LLP and UnAV-100
datasets shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种高帧率视频理解方案DVU和GRT框架，通过运动补偿和语义融合技术降低令牌化成本，并创建了DIVE评测标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型多采用低帧率采样，丢失了密集的时间信息，特别在讲座理解等需要精确时间对齐的任务中表现局限。

Method: 提出GRT两阶段框架：(1)运动补偿间间控令牌化，利用像素级运动估计跳过静态区域，实现次线性令牌增长；(2)语义场景内令牌融合，融合静态区域令牌保留动态语义。

Result: 在DIVE标准上，GRT表现超过更大的VLLM基线模型，并且随帧率增加而扩展性好。

Conclusion: 密集时间信息对视频理解至关重要，GRT框架能够实现高效、可扩展的高帧率视频理解。

Abstract: High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in
video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and
benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or
keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise
avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to
redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While
this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like
lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and
requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense
Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by
reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are
also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore
propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed
for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual
Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated
Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during
tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)
Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions
within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.
Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales
positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal
information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video
understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法为创建计算效率高的遥感基础模型提供了有效解决方案，CSMoE在表征能力、准确性和计算效率之间实现了更优的平衡

Abstract: Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders has attracted great
attention for remote sensing (RS) foundation model (FM) development, enabling
improved representation learning across diverse sensors and downstream tasks.
However, existing RS FMs often either suffer from substantial computational
complexity during both training and inference or exhibit limited
representational capacity. These issues restrict their practical applicability
in RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the
efficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism
into the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific
expert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation, we apply it on the
Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) model, resulting in the Cross-Sensor
Mixture-of-Experts (CSMoE) model. In addition, we introduce a thematic-climatic
descriptor-driven sampling strategy for the construction of a representative
and diverse training set to train our CSMoE model. Extensive experiments on
scene classification, semantic segmentation, and content-based image retrieval
demonstrate that our adaptation yields a reduction in computational
requirements while maintaining or improving representational performance.
Compared to state-of-the-art RS FMs, CSMoE achieves a superior trade-off
between representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. On
average, CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of
existing RS FMs, while maintaining competitive performance across all
experiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation
for creating computationally efficient RS FMs. The code for the model, the
training set creation, and the model weights will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法在不同数据集上表现出卓越的鲁棒性，简化了虚拟染色的数据采集过程，为推进其发展提供了新思路

Abstract: Accurate histopathological diagnosis often requires multiple differently
stained tissue sections, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
environmentally taxing due to the use of multiple chemical stains. Recently,
virtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster,
tissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual
staining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications,
primarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such
data is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort
tissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining
procedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available
virtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it
difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To
address this challenge, we propose a robust virtual staining framework
featuring cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches
between generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models across five datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% on
internal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Moreover, in datasets with
substantial misalignment, our approach achieves a remarkable 23.8% improvement
in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to baseline models. The exceptional
robustness of the proposed method across diverse datasets simplifies the data
acquisition process for virtual staining and offers new insights for advancing
its development.

Abstract: Imagine living in a world composed solely of primitive shapes, could you
still recognise familiar objects? Recent studies have shown that abstract
images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic
information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from
such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster
images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and
investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different
abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction
Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images
generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then
train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks
including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a
comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We
also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective
format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision
tasks.

substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain
gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to
address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection
for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with
their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric
spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware
teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a
Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.
Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth
predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty
estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are
essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the
domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric
embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two
domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential
Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts
informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in
four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D
object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night
adaptation.

*Michal Szczepanski,Martyna Poreba,Karim Haroun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STEP框架结合动态补丁合并和令牌剪枝，显著降低Vision Transformer的计算和内存成本，在保持精度的同时实现最高4倍计算复杂度降低和1.7倍推理速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在语义分割中表现优异但计算和内存成本过高，需要一种高效的令牌缩减方法来平衡性能与效率。

Method: 提出STEP混合令牌缩减框架，包含轻量级CNN策略网络dCTS进行动态补丁合并生成超补丁，并在编码器块中集成早期退出机制来移除高置信度超令牌。

Result: dCTS单独应用可将令牌数量减少2.5倍，计算成本降低2.6倍，吞吐量提升3.4倍。完整STEP框架实现最高4倍计算复杂度降低和1.7倍推理速度提升，精度损失不超过2.0%，40%令牌可在最终层前提前终止。

Conclusion: STEP框架有效解决了ViT在语义分割中的效率问题，通过动态令牌管理实现了计算效率与精度的良好平衡，适用于高分辨率图像处理。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic
segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To
address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid
token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning
to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core
of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible
merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove
high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method
on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to
1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be
reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching
scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase
in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP
framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in
computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum
accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up
to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the
final encoder layer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cinéaste是一个用于长视频电影理解的综合基准测试，包含3119个多选题，涵盖200部电影的1805个场景，测试5种细粒度推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，最高仅63.15%准确率，显示长时序推理是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解基准主要测试短片段识别或使用模板化问题，缺乏对长叙事内容的细粒度推理评估能力。

Method: 使用GPT-4o整合视觉描述、字幕、场景标题和摘要生成多样化问题，采用两阶段过滤（上下文独立性和真实性验证）确保问题质量。

Result: 现有多模态大语言模型在Cinéaste上表现困难，最佳开源模型准确率仅63.15%，长时序推理是主要挑战。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了细粒度上下文理解的重大挑战，强调了长视频电影理解能力发展的必要性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video
understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension
remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or
use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained
reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce
$\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie
understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer
pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel
fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate
diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions,
scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To
ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering
process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video
context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency
against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that
existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals
that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top
open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant
challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for
advancements in long-form movie comprehension.

Motivation: 现有考试基准主要关注理解和推理任务，而生成基准强调世界知识和视觉概念的展示，忽略了严格绘图考试的评估。需要一个新的基准来综合评估模型的知识整合、推理和生成能力。

Method: 构建包含1000个样本的多学科文本到图像考试基准，涵盖10个学科，采用四级分类的考试风格提示。每个问题配备真实图像和细粒度评分点，用于精确评估语义正确性和视觉合理性。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-Image-1和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image等最先进模型，严格得分也低于15%，大多数模型得分接近0%，表明该基准具有巨大挑战性。

Conclusion: 通过将图像生成框架化为考试，GenExam提供了对模型知识整合、推理和生成能力的严格评估，为通向通用AGI的道路提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require
integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style
benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current
generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual
concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce
GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams,
featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized
under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images
and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic
correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve
less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the
great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam,
GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge,
reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for path
planning of cellular connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating beyond
visual line of sight (BVLoS). The objective is to minimize travel distance
while maximizing the quality of cellular link connectivity by considering real
world aerial coverage constraints and employing an empirical aerial channel

The proposed approach addresses the challenges due to limitations in UAV
cellular communications, highlighting the need for investigations and
considerations in this area. The RL algorithm efficiently identifies optimal

Abstract: In this work, an existing deep neural network approach for determining a
robot's pose from visual information (RGB images) is modified, improving its
localization performance without impacting its ease of training. Explicitly,
the network's loss function is extended in a manner which intuitively combines
the positional and rotational error in order to increase robustness to
perceptual aliasing. An improvement in the localization accuracy for indoor
scenes is observed: with decreases of up to 9.64% and 2.99% in the median
positional and rotational error respectively, when compared to the unmodified
network.
  Additionally, photogrammetry data is used to produce a pose-labelled dataset
which allows the above model to be trained on a local environment, resulting in
localization accuracies of 0.11m & 0.89 degrees. This trained model forms the
basis of a navigation algorithm, which is tested in real-time on a TurtleBot (a
wheeled robotic device). As such, this work introduces a full pipeline for

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have shown great potential for

Abstract: Demands for software-defined vehicles (SDV) are rising and electric vehicles
(EVs) are increasingly being equipped with powerful computers. This enables
onboard AI systems to optimize charge-aware path optimization customized to
reflect vehicle's current condition and environment. We present VEGA, a
charge-aware EV navigation agent that plans over a charger-annotated road graph
using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with budgeted A* teacher-student
guidance under state-of-charge (SoC) feasibility. VEGA consists of two modules.
First, a physics-informed neural operator (PINO), trained on real vehicle speed
and battery-power logs, uses recent vehicle speed logs to estimate aerodynamic
drag, rolling resistance, mass, motor and regenerative-braking efficiencies,
and auxiliary load by learning a vehicle-custom dynamics. Second, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent uses these dynamics to optimize a path with
optimal charging stops and dwell times under SoC constraints. VEGA requires no
additional sensors and uses only vehicle speed signals. It may serve as a
virtual sensor for power and efficiency to potentially reduce EV cost. In
evaluation on long routes like San Francisco to New York, VEGA's stops, dwell
times, SoC management, and total travel time closely track Tesla Trip Planner
while being slightly more conservative, presumably due to real vehicle
conditions such as vehicle parameter drift due to deterioration. Although
trained only in U.S. regions, VEGA was able to compute optimal charge-aware
paths in France and Japan, demonstrating generalizability. It achieves
practical integration of physics-informed learning and RL for EV eco-routing.

Conclusion: 该框架为涉及复杂缆绳-缆绳和缆绳-刚体相互作用的系统提供了一个多用途模拟器，实现了之前无法实现的功能。

Abstract: We present a computational framework for simulating filaments interacting
with rigid bodies through contact. Filaments are challenging to simulate due to
their codimensionality, i.e., they are one-dimensional structures embedded in
three-dimensional space. Existing methods often assume that filaments remain
permanently attached to rigid bodies. Our framework unifies discrete elastic
rod (DER) modeling, a pressure field patch contact model, and a convex contact
formulation to accurately simulate frictional interactions between slender
filaments and rigid bodies - capabilities not previously achievable. Owing to
the convex formulation of contact, each time step can be solved to global
optimality, guaranteeing complementarity between contact velocity and impulse.
We validate the framework by assessing the accuracy of frictional forces and
comparing its physical fidelity against baseline methods. Finally, we
demonstrate its applicability in both soft robotics, such as a stochastic
filament-based gripper, and deformable object manipulation, such as shoelace
tying, providing a versatile simulator for systems involving complex
filament-filament and filament-rigid body interactions.

Motivation: 解决汽车人系统在执行计划路径时遇到人员或物体干预时的安全暂停和恢复问题，避免重新规划路径的复杂性。

Result: 方法能够高效处理安全停止和非计划偏移，系统能够在不重新规划路径的情况下恢复到轨迹计划，模拟结果显示性能优于纯追踪方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为可反馈线性化为双积分器的汽车人系统提供了一种有效的轨迹追踪方案，能够在保持安全性的同时处理外部干扰，并实现自动恢复轨迹。

Abstract: Many robotic systems must follow planned paths yet pause safely and resume
when people or objects intervene. We present an output-space method for systems
whose tracked output can be feedback-linearized to a double integrator (e.g.,
manipulators). The approach has two parts. Offline, we perform a pre-run
reachability check to verify that the motion plan respects speed and
acceleration magnitude limits. Online, we apply a quadratic program to track
the motion plan under the same limits. We use a one-step reachability test to
bound the maximum disturbance the system is capable of rejecting. When the
state coincides with the reference path we recover perfect tracking in the
deterministic case, and we correct errors using a KKT-inspired weight. We
demonstrate that safety stops and unplanned deviations are handled efficiently,
and the system returns to the motion plan without replanning. We demonstrate
our system's improved performance over pure pursuit in simulation.

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation (WBM) for humanoid robots presents a promising
approach for executing embracing tasks involving bulky objects, where
traditional grasping relying on end-effectors only remains limited in such
scenarios due to inherent stability and payload constraints. This paper
introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a pre-trained
human motion prior with a neural signed distance field (NSDF) representation to
achieve robust whole-body embracing. Our method leverages a teacher-student
architecture to distill large-scale human motion data, generating kinematically
natural and physically feasible whole-body motion patterns. This facilitates
coordinated control across the arms and torso, enabling stable multi-contact
interactions that enhance the robustness in manipulation and also the load
capacity. The embedded NSDF further provides accurate and continuous geometric
perception, improving contact awareness throughout long-horizon tasks. We
thoroughly evaluate the approach through comprehensive simulations and
real-world experiments. The results demonstrate improved adaptability to
diverse shapes and sizes of objects and also successful sim-to-real transfer.
These indicate that the proposed framework offers an effective and practical
solution for multi-contact and long-horizon WBM tasks of humanoid robots.

Abstract: Central airway obstruction (CAO) is a life-threatening condition with
increasing incidence, caused by tumors in and outside of the airway.
Traditional treatment methods such as bronchoscopy and electrocautery can be
used to remove the tumor completely; however, these methods carry a high risk
of complications. Recent advances allow robotic interventions with lesser risk.
The combination of robot interventions with scene understanding and mapping
also opens up the possibilities for automation. We present a novel pipeline
that enables real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of the central
airway using monocular endoscopic video.
  Our approach combines DROID-SLAM with a segmentation model trained to
identify obstructive tissues. The SLAM module reconstructs the 3D geometry of
the airway in real time, while the segmentation masks guide the annotation of
obstruction regions within the reconstructed point cloud. To validate our
pipeline, we evaluate the reconstruction quality using ex vivo models.
  Qualitative and quantitative results show high similarity between ground
truth CT scans and the 3D reconstructions (0.62 mm Chamfer distance). By
integrating segmentation directly into the SLAM workflow, our system produces
annotated 3D maps that highlight clinically relevant regions in real time.
High-speed capabilities of the pipeline allows quicker reconstructions compared
to previous work, reflecting the surgical scene more accurately.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate semantic
segmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for endoscopic CAO scenarios. Our
framework is modular and can generalize to other anatomies or procedures with
minimal changes, offering a promising step toward autonomous robotic
interventions.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了8种视觉语言模型在假肢手感知和抓取推理任务中的表现，通过统一基准测试发现模型在物体识别方面表现良好，但在尺寸估计和抓取参数推断方面存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型作为半自主假肢手高级感知模块的潜力，替代传统需要多个独立模块（物体检测、姿态估计、抓取规划）的复杂流程。

Method: 建立端到端感知和抓取推理的统一基准，使用34张常见物体图像，通过结构化JSON输出提示评估8种当代VLM模型在物体识别、属性分析和抓取参数推断方面的能力。

Result: 大多数模型在物体识别和形状识别方面表现优异，但在尺寸估计和抓取参数（特别是手腕旋转和手部开度）推断的准确性上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型展现出作为仿生肢体半自主控制高级感知模块的潜力，但目前在尺寸估计和精确抓取参数推断方面仍存在局限性。

Abstract: This study examines the potential of utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs)
to improve the perceptual capabilities of semi-autonomous prosthetic hands. We
introduce a unified benchmark for end-to-end perception and grasp inference,
evaluating a single VLM to perform tasks that traditionally require complex
pipelines with separate modules for object detection, pose estimation, and
grasp planning. To establish the feasibility and current limitations of this
approach, we benchmark eight contemporary VLMs on their ability to perform a
unified task essential for bionic grasping. From a single static image, they
should (1) identify common objects and their key properties (name, shape,
orientation, and dimensions), and (2) infer appropriate grasp parameters (grasp
type, wrist rotation, hand aperture, and number of fingers). A corresponding
prompt requesting a structured JSON output was employed with a dataset of 34
snapshots of common objects. Key performance metrics, including accuracy for
categorical attributes (e.g., object name, shape) and errors in numerical
estimates (e.g., dimensions, hand aperture), along with latency and cost, were
analyzed. The results demonstrated that most models exhibited high performance
in object identification and shape recognition, while accuracy in estimating
dimensions and inferring optimal grasp parameters, particularly hand rotation
and aperture, varied more significantly. This work highlights the current
capabilities and limitations of VLMs as advanced perceptual modules for
semi-autonomous control of bionic limbs, demonstrating their potential for
effective prosthetic applications.

*Zidong Chen,Zihao Guo,Peng Wang,ThankGod Itua Egbe,Yan Lyu,Chenghao Qian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的非均匀时间调度策略，通过U形训练时间安排和密集跳跃推理调度，解决了流匹配方法中泛化能力饱和和推理步骤增加导致性能下降的问题，在机器人任务上实现了23.7%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现流匹配方法中泛化能力在流轨迹早期就出现饱和，且增加推理时的欧拉积分步骤反而会降低策略性能，这归因于均匀间隔的积分步骤过度采样后期区域导致动作受限，以及速度场在接近时间1时变得非Lipschitz导致不稳定。

Method: 提出使用非均匀时间调度（如U形）进行训练，强调早期和晚期时间阶段以规范化策略训练；在推理时使用密集跳跃积分调度，通过单步积分替换跳跃点后的多步积分，避免不稳定区域。

Result: 该方法在多样化机器人任务上相比最先进基线实现了高达23.7%的性能增益，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略是一种高效的单步学习器，同时通过多步积分推动性能提升，成功解决了流匹配方法中的泛化和稳定性问题。

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a competitive framework for learning
high-quality generative policies in robotics; however, we find that
generalisation arises and saturates early along the flow trajectory, in
accordance with recent findings in the literature. We further observe that
increasing the number of Euler integration steps during inference
counter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attribute
this to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the
late-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training
trajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field
becoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability.
To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform
time scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early
and late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump
integration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to
replace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas
around 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still
pushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7%
performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks.

Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving.
The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate
trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like
among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art
planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous
driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban
traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves
the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress,
comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first
demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the
importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in
real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further
improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a
framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based
approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 该主动触觉探索方法为机器人操控和交互任务提供了一种稳健的物体位姿估计方案，适用于视觉数据受限的复杂环境。

Abstract: Robust object pose estimation is essential for manipulation and interaction
tasks in robotics, particularly in scenarios where visual data is limited or
sensitive to lighting, occlusions, and appearances. Tactile sensors often offer
limited and local contact information, making it challenging to reconstruct the
pose from partial data. Our approach uses sensorimotor exploration to actively
control a robot hand to interact with the object. We train with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to explore and collect tactile data. The collected 3D point
clouds are used to iteratively refine the object's shape and pose. In our
setup, one hand holds the object steady while the other performs active
exploration. We show that our method can actively explore an object's surface
to identify critical pose features without prior knowledge of the object's
geometry. Supplementary material and more demonstrations will be provided at

Conclusion: 分层优化臂腿协调框架在六足机器人上取得成功，为在复杂建筑工地环境中的进一步应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, the number of high-rise buildings and
large public facilities is increasing, making curtain walls an essential
component of modern architecture with widespread applications. Traditional
curtain wall installation methods face challenges such as variable on-site
terrain, high labor intensity, low construction efficiency, and significant
safety risks. Large panels often require multiple workers to complete
installation. To address these issues, based on a hexapod curtain wall
installation robot, we design a hierarchical optimization-based whole-body
control framework for coordinated arm-leg planning tailored to three key tasks:
wall installation, ceiling installation, and floor laying. This framework
integrates the motion of the hexapod legs with the operation of the folding arm
and the serial-parallel manipulator. We conduct experiments on the hexapod
curtain wall installation robot to validate the proposed control method,
demonstrating its capability in performing curtain wall installation tasks. Our
results confirm the effectiveness of the hierarchical optimization-based
arm-leg coordination framework for the hexapod robot, laying the foundation for
its further application in complex construction site environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于气压计的姿态估计架构，利用气压高度测量在SO(3)流形上通过非线性观测器推断垂直速度和姿态，解决了GNSS拒止环境下IMU单独估计姿态的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒止或高动态环境中，仅使用IMU无法可靠估计姿态，因为重力加速度和惯性加速度之间存在模糊性。虽然可以使用辅助速度传感器，但这些传感器可能不可用、间歇性或成本高昂。

Method: 采用级联确定性Riccati观测器和互补滤波器的非线性观测器架构，在SO(3)流形上利用气压高度测量来推断垂直速度和姿态，确保在一致可观测条件下的几乎全局渐近稳定性。

Result: 该设计实现了几何一致性，气压计辅助估计被证明是一种轻量级且有效的补充模态。

Conclusion: 气压计辅助姿态估计架构为GNSS拒止环境提供了一种可靠、轻量级的解决方案，通过非线性观测器实现了稳健的姿态估计。

Abstract: Accurate and robust attitude estimation is a central challenge for autonomous
vehicles operating in GNSS-denied or highly dynamic environments. In such
cases, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) alone are insufficient for reliable
tilt estimation due to the ambiguity between gravitational and inertial
accelerations. While auxiliary velocity sensors, such as GNSS, Pitot tubes,
Doppler radar, or visual odometry, are often used, they can be unavailable,
intermittent, or costly. This work introduces a barometer-aided attitude
estimation architecture that leverages barometric altitude measurements to
infer vertical velocity and attitude within a nonlinear observer on SO(3). The
design cascades a deterministic Riccati observer with a complementary filter,
ensuring Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) under a uniform
observability condition while maintaining geometric consistency. The analysis
highlights barometer-aided estimation as a lightweight and effective
complementary modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋变暖和酸化增加了温度敏感贝类（如牡蛎）大规模死亡事件的风险，需要开发长期监测系统。人工水下作业成本高且危险，因此需要更安全高效的机器人解决方案。

Method: 开发了DREAM框架，这是一个视觉语言模型（VLM）引导的自主框架，使水下机器人能够进行实时、环境感知的决策，无需人工干预。

Result: 在牡蛎监测任务中，比基线方法节省31.5%时间；相比普通VLM，减少23%步骤的同时覆盖更多8.88%的牡蛎。在沉船场景中，实现100%覆盖且无碰撞，比普通模型减少27.5%步骤。

Conclusion: DREAM框架为水下长期监测提供了一种高效、自主的解决方案，在目标探测和探索方面表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The ocean is warming and acidifying, increasing the risk of mass mortality
events for temperature-sensitive shellfish such as oysters. This motivates the
development of long-term monitoring systems. However, human labor is costly and
long-duration underwater work is highly hazardous, thus favoring robotic
solutions as a safer and more efficient option. To enable underwater robots to
make real-time, environment-aware decisions without human intervention, we must
equip them with an intelligent "brain." This highlights the need for
persistent,wide-area, and low-cost benthic monitoring. To this end, we present
DREAM, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided autonomy framework for long-term
underwater exploration and habitat monitoring. The results show that our
framework is highly efficient in finding and exploring target objects (e.g.,
oysters, shipwrecks) without prior location information. In the
oyster-monitoring task, our framework takes 31.5% less time than the previous
baseline with the same amount of oysters. Compared to the vanilla VLM, it uses
23% fewer steps while covering 8.88% more oysters. In shipwreck scenes, our
framework successfully explores and maps the wreck without collisions,
requiring 27.5% fewer steps than the vanilla model and achieving 100% coverage,
while the vanilla model achieves 60.23% average coverage in our shipwreck
environments.

Motivation: PDDL是机器人规划中广泛采用的标准，但为不同应用手动设计领域既费时又容易出错，这阻碍了其采用和实际部署。

Method: 提出SPAR框架，利用LLM的生成能力从自然语言输入自动生成PDDL领域；首先构建系统验证的无人机规划数据集，然后设计提示框架生成高质量PDDL领域。

Result: 生成的领域通过语法验证、可执行性、可行性和可解释性评估，证明LLM能显著加速复杂规划领域的创建。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了LLM在加速复杂规划领域创建方面的潜力，提供了可复现的数据集和评估流程，使没有经验的领域专家也能将其用于实际任务，推动空中机器人和自动化规划的未来研究。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of automatic domain generation for the Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a
particular focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks. Although PDDL is a
widely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for
diverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is
labor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world
deployment. To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that
leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid,
diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input. To
this end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV
planning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated
problems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions. Building on
this dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL
domains from language input. The generated domains are evaluated through syntax
validation, executability, feasibility, and interpretability. Overall, this
work demonstrates that LLMs can substantially accelerate the creation of
complex planning domains, providing a reproducible dataset and evaluation
pipeline that enables application experts without prior experience to leverage
it for practical tasks and advance future research in aerial robotics and
automated planning.

Result: 在ShapeNet-ViPC基准和YCB-Complete数据集上的广泛实验证实了HGACNet的有效性，展示了最先进的性能以及在真实机器人操作任务中的强适用性。

Conclusion: HGACNet通过分层几何特征编码和图像引导先验融合，成功解决了点云补全问题，在性能和实际应用方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robotic perception, object
reconstruction and supporting downstream tasks like grasp planning, obstacle
avoidance, and manipulation. However, incomplete geometry caused by
self-occlusion and sensor limitations can significantly degrade downstream
reasoning and interaction. To address these challenges, we propose HGACNet, a
novel framework that reconstructs complete point clouds of individual objects
by hierarchically encoding 3D geometric features and fusing them with
image-guided priors from a single-view RGB image. At the core of our approach,
the Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) encoder adaptively selects critical
local points through graph attention-based downsampling and progressively
refines hierarchical geometric features to better capture structural continuity
and spatial relationships. To strengthen cross-modal interaction, we further
design a Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Fusion (MSCF) module that performs
attention-based feature alignment between hierarchical geometric features and
structured visual representations, enabling fine-grained semantic guidance for
completion. In addition, we proposed the contrastive loss (C-Loss) to
explicitly align the feature distributions across modalities, improving
completion fidelity under modality discrepancy. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on both the ShapeNet-ViPC benchmark and the YCB-Complete dataset
confirm the effectiveness of HGACNet, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance as well as strong applicability in real-world robotic manipulation
tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in large-scale outdoor environments faces
many challenges; we specifically address a coupled one: long-range targets that
reduce to tiny projections and intermittent visibility due to partial or
complete occlusion. We present a unified, lightweight closed-loop system built
on an aligned multi-scale image tile hierarchy. Through hierarchical
target-saliency fusion, it summarizes localized semantic contrast into a stable
coarse-layer regional saliency that provides the target direction and indicates
target visibility. This regional saliency supports visibility-aware heading
maintenance through keyframe memory, saliency-weighted fusion of historical
headings, and active search during temporary invisibility. The system avoids
whole-image rescaling, enables deterministic bottom-up aggregation, supports
zero-shot navigation, and runs efficiently on a mobile robot. Across simulation
and real-world outdoor trials, the system detects semantic targets beyond 150m,
maintains a correct heading through visibility changes with 82.6% probability,
and improves overall task success by 17.5% compared with the SOTA methods,
demonstrating robust ZSON toward distant and intermittently observable targets.

Conclusion: 基础模型类的实事模拟方法能够有效解决工业插入任务中的自动化挑战，提高了安全性和效率。

Abstract: The industrial insertion of flexible flat cables (FFCs) into receptacles
presents a significant challenge owing to the need for submillimeter precision
when handling the deformable cables. In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion
with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory
generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate
this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism
caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on
training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as
industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL
algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim
approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages
to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing
for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real
transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those
visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and
spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we
use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human
intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial
prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method
exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real
environments without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FSR-VLN通过分层场景图和快慢推理机制有效解决了长距离视觉语言导航的挑战，在性能和效率方面都有显著提升，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental challenge in robotic
systems, with broad applications for the deployment of embodied agents in
real-world environments. Despite recent advances, existing approaches are
limited in long-range spatial reasoning, often exhibiting low success rates and
high inference latency, particularly in long-range navigation tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose FSR-VLN, a vision-language navigation system that
combines a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) with Fast-to-Slow
Navigation Reasoning (FSR). The HMSG provides a multi-modal map representation
supporting progressive retrieval, from coarse room-level localization to
fine-grained goal view and object identification. Building on HMSG, FSR first
performs fast matching to efficiently select candidate rooms, views, and
objects, then applies VLM-driven refinement for final goal selection. We
evaluated FSR-VLN across four comprehensive indoor datasets collected by
humanoid robots, utilizing 87 instructions that encompass a diverse range of
object categories. FSR-VLN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
datasets, measured by the retrieval success rate (RSR), while reducing the
response time by 82% compared to VLM-based methods on tour videos by activating
slow reasoning only when fast intuition fails. Furthermore, we integrate
FSR-VLN with speech interaction, planning, and control modules on a Unitree-G1
humanoid robot, enabling natural language interaction and real-time navigation.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提高了可穿戴外骨骼系统的任务通用性和用户适应性

Abstract: Wearable exoskeletons can augment human strength and reduce muscle fatigue
during specific tasks. However, developing personalized and task-generalizable
assistance algorithms remains a critical challenge. To address this, a
meta-imitation learning approach is proposed. This approach leverages a
task-specific neural network to predict human elbow joint movements, enabling
effective assistance while enhancing generalization to new scenarios. To
accelerate data collection, full-body keypoint motions are extracted from
publicly available RGB video and motion-capture datasets across multiple tasks,
and subsequently retargeted in simulation. Elbow flexion trajectories generated
in simulation are then used to train the task-specific neural network within
the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework, which allows the network to
rapidly adapt to novel tasks and unseen users with only a few gradient updates.
The adapted network outputs personalized references tracked by a
gravity-compensated PD controller to ensure stable assistance. Experimental
results demonstrate that the exoskeleton significantly reduces both muscle
activation and metabolic cost for new users performing untrained tasks,
compared to performing without exoskeleton assistance. These findings suggest
that the proposed framework effectively improves task generalization and user
adaptability for wearable exoskeleton systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在腿式运动控制中面临分布外条件性能下降和仿真-现实差距问题，主要依赖域随机化方法覆盖真实环境

Method: 提出解耦框架，将支撑腿控制和摆动腿控制分离，获得快速在线适应能力，缓解陌生环境中的 sim-to-real 问题

Result: 在各种仿真和真实世界实验中证明了对水平力干扰、不平坦地形、重载和偏置载荷以及 sim-to-real 差距的有效性

Conclusion: 解耦控制框架为解决腿式 locomotion 中的鲁棒性和 sim-to-real 转移问题提供了有效的新途径

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable progress in legged
locomotion control, it often suffers from performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions and discrepancies between the simulation
and the real environments. Instead of mainly relying on domain randomization
(DR) to best cover the real environments and thereby close the sim-to-real gap
and enhance robustness, this work proposes an emerging decoupled framework that
acquires fast online adaptation ability and mitigates the sim-to-real problems
in unfamiliar environments by isolating stance-leg control and swing-leg
control. Various simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness against horizontal force disturbances, uneven terrains, heavy and
biased payloads, and sim-to-real gap.

*Mengzhu Li,Yunyu Zhou,He Ying,F. Richard Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CDFlow通过神经ODE学习构型空间中的连续流，解决了传统CDF在高自由度机器人中的梯度模糊和几何失真问题，显著提升了运动规划的效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统构型空间距离场(CDF)在高自由度机器人中存在两个主要问题：1)只能返回单个最近碰撞构型，忽略了多模态特性导致梯度模糊；2)依赖稀疏采样，无法识别真正最近构型，产生过度平滑近似和几何失真。

Method: 提出CDFlow框架，使用神经ODE学习构型空间中的连续流。重新定义问题为建模最小距离碰撞构型的分布，而非寻找单个最近点。引入自适应细化采样策略生成高质量训练数据。

Result: 在高自由度运动规划任务上的大量实验表明，CDFlow相比现有CDF方法显著提高了规划效率、轨迹质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CDFlow能够为碰撞感知机器人在复杂环境中实现更鲁棒和高效的运动规划，通过神经ODE隐式建模多模态分布并产生平滑一致的梯度场。

Abstract: Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) are a fundamental representation in robot
motion planning. Their configuration-space counterpart, the Configuration Space
Distance Field (CDF), directly encodes distances in joint space, offering a
unified representation for optimization and control. However, existing CDF
formulations face two major challenges in high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robots:
(1) they effectively return only a single nearest collision configuration,
neglecting the multi-modal nature of minimal-distance collision configurations
and leading to gradient ambiguity; and (2) they rely on sparse sampling of the
collision boundary, which often fails to identify the true closest
configurations, producing oversmoothed approximations and geometric distortion
in high-dimensional spaces. We propose CDFlow, a novel framework that addresses
these limitations by learning a continuous flow in configuration space via
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). We redefine the problem
from finding a single nearest point to modeling the distribution of
minimal-distance collision configurations. We also introduce an adaptive
refinement sampling strategy to generate high-fidelity training data for this
distribution. The resulting Neural ODE implicitly models this multi-modal
distribution and produces a smooth, consistent gradient field-derived as the
expected direction towards the distribution-that mitigates gradient ambiguity
and preserves sharp geometric features. Extensive experiments on high-DoF
motion planning tasks demonstrate that CDFlow significantly improves planning
efficiency, trajectory quality, and robustness compared to existing CDF-based
methods, enabling more robust and efficient planning for collision-aware robots
in complex environments.

Motivation: 触视语言动作模型在复杂真实任务中遇到挑战，监督微调受限于数据质量，需要更有效的学习方法。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的人在循环双演员精细调整框架：主演员负责多任务性能，精细演员进行潜在空间适配；轻量谈话调整方案将人类纠正转换为语义基础的语言命令生成新数据集。

Result: 在101分钟在线微调中实现三个任务100%成功率；长期限任务在12次连续操作中保持50%成功率；多机器人训练效率提升2倍。

Conclusion: 该框架通过人机协同的强化学习方法，有效解决了VLA模型在复杂真实任务中的挑战，显示了高效的学习能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models demonstrate strong generalization in
robotic manipulation but face challenges in complex, real-world tasks. While
supervised fine-tuning with demonstrations is constrained by data quality,
reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. We propose a
human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework grounded in RL. The
framework integrates a primary actor for robust multi-task performance with a
refinement actor for latent-space adaptation. Beyond standard physical
interventions, we introduce a lightweight talk-and-tweak scheme that converts
human corrections into semantically grounded language commands, thereby
generating a new dataset for policy learning. In real-world multi-task
experiments, our approach achieves 100% success across three tasks within 101
minutes of online fine-tuning. For long-horizon tasks, it sustains a 50%
success rate over 12 consecutive operations. Furthermore, the framework scales
effectively to multi-robot training, achieving up to a 2 times improvement in
efficiency when using dual robots. The experiment videos are available at

Motivation: 现有的全身控制框架大多是任务特定的，依赖大量人工奖励工程，跨任务和技能的泛化能力有限，阻碍了在复杂现实场景中的部署。

Method: 采用掩码在线蒸馏框架与条件变分自编码器（CVAE）相结合，建模行为分布，无需从头重新训练即可高效获取新行为。

Conclusion: BFM是朝着通用人形控制基础模型迈出的有希望的一步，为解决现有WBC系统的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Whole-body control (WBC) of humanoid robots has witnessed remarkable progress
in skill versatility, enabling a wide range of applications such as locomotion,
teleoperation, and motion tracking. Despite these achievements, existing WBC
frameworks remain largely task-specific, relying heavily on labor-intensive
reward engineering and demonstrating limited generalization across tasks and
skills. These limitations hinder their response to arbitrary control modes and
restrict their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we revisit existing WBC systems and identify a shared objective
across diverse tasks: the generation of appropriate behaviors that guide the
robot toward desired goal states. Building on this insight, we propose the
Behavior Foundation Model (BFM), a generative model pretrained on large-scale
behavioral datasets to capture broad, reusable behavioral knowledge for
humanoid robots. BFM integrates a masked online distillation framework with a
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model behavioral distributions,
thereby enabling flexible operation across diverse control modes and efficient
acquisition of novel behaviors without retraining from scratch. Extensive
experiments in both simulation and on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate
that BFM generalizes robustly across diverse WBC tasks while rapidly adapting
to new behaviors. These results establish BFM as a promising step toward a
foundation model for general-purpose humanoid control.

Abstract: This study addresses a flexible holding tool for robotic disassembly. We
propose a shell-type soft jig that securely and universally holds objects,
mitigating the risk of component damage and adapting to diverse shapes while
enabling soft fixation that is robust to recognition, planning, and control
errors. The balloon-based holding mechanism ensures proper alignment and stable
holding performance, thereby reducing the need for dedicated jig design, highly
accurate perception, precise grasping, and finely tuned trajectory planning
that are typically required with conventional fixtures. Our experimental
results demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed jig through
performance comparisons with a vise and a jamming-gripper-inspired soft jig.
Tests on ten different objects further showed representative successes and
failures, clarifying the jig's limitations and outlook.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于软件夹具的重新抓取方法，利用凝固转变现象制造可变形的稳定空洞，以减少机器人组装中的位置不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硬件夹具缺乏适应性且需要为每种零件进行专门设计，而软件夹具可以连续变形以适应多样化的物体形状。

Method: 通过将三角锥形工具压入膜内并排空封闭空气，形成稳定的空洞作为放置空间，并优化压刷深度以平衡放置稳定性和抓取器可达性。

Result: 在10种不同形状的机械零件上进行投放实验，大部分物体的放置成功率超过80%，圆柱形物体超过90%，失败主要由于几何约束和膜性质导致。

Conclusion: 该软件夹具能够实现通用、精确且可重复的重新抓取，为组装自动化中的硬件夹具提供了实用的替代方案，同时也明确了其当前的限制和未来潜力。

Abstract: Regrasping on fixtures is a promising approach to reduce pose uncertainty in
robotic assembly, but conventional rigid fixtures lack adaptability and require
dedicated designs for each part. To overcome this limitation, we propose a soft
jig inspired by the jamming transition phenomenon, which can be continuously
deformed to accommodate diverse object geometries. By pressing a
triangular-pyramid-shaped tool into the membrane and evacuating the enclosed
air, a stable cavity is formed as a placement space. We further optimize the
stamping depth to balance placement stability and gripper accessibility. In
soft-jig-based regrasping, the key challenge lies in optimizing the cavity size
to achieve precise dropping; once the part is reliably placed, subsequent
grasping can be performed with reduced uncertainty. Accordingly, we conducted
drop experiments on ten mechanical parts of varying shapes, which achieved
placement success rates exceeding 80% for most objects and above 90% for
cylindrical ones, while failures were mainly caused by geometric constraints
and membrane properties. These results demonstrate that the proposed jig
enables general-purpose, accurate, and repeatable regrasping, while also
clarifying its current limitations and future potential as a practical
alternative to rigid fixtures in assembly automation.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了感知-控制频率不匹配问题，实现了高频鲁棒导航，代码将开源供社区参考

Abstract: Robust autonomous navigation for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) in complex
environments is a critical capability. However, modern end-to-end navigation
faces a key challenge: the high-frequency control loop needed for agile flight
conflicts with low-frequency perception streams, which are limited by sensor
update rates and significant computational cost. This mismatch forces
conventional synchronous models into undesirably low control rates. To resolve
this, we propose an asynchronous reinforcement learning framework that
decouples perception and control, enabling a high-frequency policy to act on
the latest IMU state for immediate reactivity, while incorporating perception
features asynchronously. To manage the resulting data staleness, we introduce a
theoretically-grounded Temporal Encoding Module (TEM) that explicitly
conditions the policy on perception delays, a strategy complemented by a
two-stage curriculum to ensure stable and efficient training. Validated in
extensive simulations, our method was successfully deployed in zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer on an onboard NUC, where it sustains a 100~Hz control rate
and demonstrates robust, agile navigation in cluttered real-world environments.
Our source code will be released for community reference.

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅展示了一种高效的碰撞避免策略，还强调了蟻子受启发的神经模型在推进虫类智能集体行为研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Anyone who has tried to swat a fly has likely been frustrated by its
remarkable agility.This ability stems from its visual neural perception system,
particularly the collision-selective neurons within its small brain.For
autonomous robots operating in complex and unfamiliar environments, achieving
similar agility is highly desirable but often constrained by the trade-off
between computational cost and performance.In this context, insect-inspired
intelligence offers a parsimonious route to low-power, computationally
efficient frameworks.In this paper, we propose an attention-driven visuomotor
control strategy inspired by a specific class of fly visual projection
neurons-the lobula plate/lobula column type-2 (LPLC2)-and their associated
escape behaviors.To our knowledge, this represents the first embodiment of an
LPLC2 neural model in the embedded vision of a physical mobile robot, enabling
collision perception and reactive evasion.The model was simplified and
optimized at 70KB in memory to suit the computational constraints of a
vision-based micro robot, the Colias, while preserving key neural perception
mechanisms.We further incorporated multi-attention mechanisms to emulate the
distributed nature of LPLC2 responses, allowing the robot to detect and react
to approaching targets both rapidly and selectively.We systematically evaluated
the proposed method against a state-of-the-art locust-inspired collision
detection model.Results showed that the fly-inspired visuomotor model achieved
comparable robustness, at success rate of 96.1% in collision detection while
producing more adaptive and elegant evasive maneuvers.Beyond demonstrating an
effective collision-avoidance strategy, this work highlights the potential of
fly-inspired neural models for advancing research into collective behaviors in
insect intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出基于分层Transformer的UltraHiT架构，用于自动化颈动脉超声扫描，首次解决内颈动脉(ICA)的自动定位难题，在未见个体上达到95%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内颈动脉(ICA)由于位置深、路径曲折且个体差异大，传统方法难以自动化扫描。研究将个体血管结构概念化为标准血管模型的形态变异，需要智能系统来适应这些变异。

Method: 采用分层Transformer决策架构：高层模块识别血管变异并切换两个底层模块（适应校正器处理变异情况，标准执行器处理正常情况）。高层模块和适应校正器均实现为因果Transformer，基于历史扫描序列生成预测。

Result: 在包含28名受试者、164条轨迹和72K样本的大规模ICA扫描数据集上测试，方法在未见个体上定位ICA的成功率达到95%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UltraHiT架构通过分层决策和Transformer技术有效解决了ICA自动扫描的挑战，展示了在复杂解剖结构自动化超声扫描中的潜力和有效性。

Abstract: Carotid ultrasound is crucial for the assessment of cerebrovascular health,
particularly the internal carotid artery (ICA). While previous research has
explored automating carotid ultrasound, none has tackled the challenging ICA.
This is primarily due to its deep location, tortuous course, and significant
individual variations, which greatly increase scanning complexity. To address
this, we propose a Hierarchical Transformer-based decision architecture, namely
UltraHiT, that integrates high-level variation assessment with low-level action
decision. Our motivation stems from conceptualizing individual vascular
structures as morphological variations derived from a standard vascular model.
The high-level module identifies variation and switches between two low-level
modules: an adaptive corrector for variations, or a standard executor for
normal cases. Specifically, both the high-level module and the adaptive
corrector are implemented as causal transformers that generate predictions
based on the historical scanning sequence. To ensure generalizability, we
collected the first large-scale ICA scanning dataset comprising 164
trajectories and 72K samples from 28 subjects of both genders. Based on the
above innovations, our approach achieves a 95% success rate in locating the ICA
on unseen individuals, outperforming baselines and demonstrating its
effectiveness. Our code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: A foundational humanoid motion tracker is expected to be able to track
diverse, highly dynamic, and contact-rich motions. More importantly, it needs
to operate stably in real-world scenarios against various dynamics
disturbances, including terrains, external forces, and physical property
changes for general practical use. To achieve this goal, we propose Any2Track
(Track Any motions under Any disturbances), a two-stage RL framework to track
various motions under multiple disturbances in the real world. Any2Track
reformulates dynamics adaptability as an additional capability on top of basic
action execution and consists of two key components: AnyTracker and AnyAdapter.
AnyTracker is a general motion tracker with a series of careful designs to
track various motions within a single policy. AnyAdapter is a history-informed
adaptation module that endows the tracker with online dynamics adaptability to
overcome the sim2real gap and multiple real-world disturbances. We deploy
Any2Track on Unitree G1 hardware and achieve a successful sim2real transfer in
a zero-shot manner. Any2Track performs exceptionally well in tracking various
motions under multiple real-world disturbances.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of predicting the future success of
open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks. Conventional approaches typically
determine success or failure after the action has been carried out. However,
they make it difficult to prevent potential hazards and rely on failures to
trigger replanning, thereby reducing the efficiency of object manipulation
sequences. To overcome these challenges, we propose a model, which predicts the
alignment between a pre-manipulation egocentric image with the planned
trajectory and a given natural language instruction. We introduce a Multi-Level
Trajectory Fusion module, which employs a state-of-the-art deep state-space
model and a transformer encoder in parallel to capture multi-level time-series
self-correlation within the end effector trajectory. Our experimental results
indicate that the proposed method outperformed existing methods, including
foundation models.

Conclusion: InterKey提供了一个可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，为鲁棒车辆定位提供了有效途径，特别是在GNSS不可用的环境中。

Abstract: Reliable global localization is critical for autonomous vehicles, especially
in environments where GNSS is degraded or unavailable, such as urban canyons
and tunnels. Although high-definition (HD) maps provide accurate priors, the
cost of data collection, map construction, and maintenance limits scalability.
OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a free and globally available alternative, but its
coarse abstraction poses challenges for matching with sensor data. We propose
InterKey, a cross-modal framework that leverages road intersections as
distinctive landmarks for global localization. Our method constructs compact
binary descriptors by jointly encoding road and building imprints from point
clouds and OSM. To bridge modality gaps, we introduce discrepancy mitigation,
orientation determination, and area-equalized sampling strategies, enabling
robust cross-modal matching. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that
InterKey achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming recent baselines by
a large margin. The framework generalizes to sensors that can produce dense
structural point clouds, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for
robust vehicle localization.

Conclusion: Petri网络提供了一种有效的形式化方法，能够建模和验证人机交互中的适应性解释系统，为建立可信赖的人机沟通提供了技术支持

Abstract: In human-robot interaction, robots must communicate in a natural and
transparent manner to foster trust, which requires adapting their communication
to the context. In this paper, we propose using Petri nets (PNs) to model
contextual information for adaptive robot explanations. PNs provide a formal,
graphical method for representing concurrent actions, causal dependencies, and
system states, making them suitable for analyzing dynamic interactions between
humans and robots. We demonstrate this approach through a scenario involving a
robot that provides explanations based on contextual cues such as user
attention and presence. Model analysis confirms key properties, including
deadlock-freeness, context-sensitive reachability, boundedness, and liveness,
showing the robustness and flexibility of PNs for designing and verifying
context-adaptive explanations in human-robot interactions.

Conclusion: 该方法通过排斥力场技术有效减少CBS算法的冲突传播问题，在多操纵器运动规划任务中显著提升了性能和效率

Abstract: We propose an efficient motion planning method designed to efficiently find
collision-free trajectories for multiple manipulators. While multi-manipulator
systems offer significant advantages, coordinating their motions is
computationally challenging owing to the high dimensionality of their composite
configuration space. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) addresses this by decoupling
motion planning, but suffers from subsequent conflicts incurred by resolving
existing conflicts, leading to an exponentially growing constraint tree of CBS.
Our proposed method is based on repulsive trajectory modification within the
two-level structure of CBS. Unlike conventional CBS variants, the low-level
planner applies a gradient descent approach using an Artificial Potential
Field. This field generates repulsive forces that guide the trajectory of the
conflicting manipulator away from those of other robots. As a result,
subsequent conflicts are less likely to occur. Additionally, we develop a
strategy that, under a specific condition, directly attempts to find a
conflict-free solution in a single step without growing the constraint tree.
Through extensive tests including physical robot experiments, we demonstrate
that our method consistently reduces the number of expanded nodes in the
constraint tree, achieves a higher success rate, and finds a solution faster
compared to Enhanced CBS and other state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce PhysicalAgent, an agentic framework for robotic manipulation
that integrates iterative reasoning, diffusion-based video generation, and
closed-loop execution. Given a textual instruction, our method generates short
video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and
iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust
recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple
perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic
embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing
against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that
our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83%
success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt
success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success
to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based
generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore
the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures. Our
framework paves the way for scalable, adaptable, and robust robot control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MAP是一个新颖的端到端轨迹规划框架，通过显式整合语义地图特征和当前自车状态，显著提升了自动驾驶轨迹规划性能，在多个指标上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法未能充分利用在线地图模块的潜力，地图特征对轨迹规划的增强作用未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出MAP框架，包含三个核心模块：规划增强的在线地图模块、自车状态引导的规划模块，以及基于当前自车状态的权重适配器。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X-seq-SPD数据集上，相比UniV2X基线方法，L2位移误差降低16.6%，脱轨率降低56.2%，综合评分提升44.5%。在CVPR2025竞赛中排名第一，比第二名综合评分高39.5%。

Conclusion: 显式利用语义地图特征能有效提升规划性能，为端到端自动驾驶系统的结构设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end autonomous driving has attracted increasing
attention for its ability to jointly model perception, prediction, and planning
within a unified framework. However, most existing approaches underutilize the
online mapping module, leaving its potential to enhance trajectory planning
largely untapped. This paper proposes MAP (Map-Assisted Planning), a novel
map-assisted end-to-end trajectory planning framework. MAP explicitly
integrates segmentation-based map features and the current ego status through a
Plan-enhancing Online Mapping module, an Ego-status-guided Planning module, and
a Weight Adapter based on current ego status. Experiments conducted on the
DAIR-V2X-seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 16.6%
reduction in L2 displacement error, a 56.2% reduction in off-road rate, and a
44.5% improvement in overall score compared to the UniV2X baseline, even
without post-processing. Furthermore, it achieves top ranking in Track 2 of the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge of MEIS
Workshop @CVPR2025, outperforming the second-best model by 39.5% in terms of
overall score. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly
leveraging semantic map features in planning and suggest new directions for
improving structure design in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在自动化检查、配送和导航任务中需要可靠的自主性，传统方法往往需要人工干预，因此需要开发能够自主导航的强化学习方法

Method: 开发基于强化学习的方法，使用自定义奖励函数（鼓励高效到达目标，惩罚碰撞和不安全行为），集成ROS和Gym兼容的训练环境进行策略学习

Result: 训练后的策略在真实无人机平台上部署测试，无人机能够成功进行自主导航，仅需最少的人工监督

Conclusion: 强化学习为基础的无人机控制在现实场景中的点对点操作具有可行性，证明了RL方法在无人机自主导航中的实际应用价值

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in automated
inspection, delivery, and navigation tasks that require reliable autonomy. This
project develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enable a single UAV
to autonomously navigate between predefined points without manual intervention.
The drone learns navigation policies through trial-and-error interaction, using
a custom reward function that encourages goal-reaching efficiency while
penalizing collisions and unsafe behavior. The control system integrates ROS
with a Gym-compatible training environment, enabling flexible deployment and
testing. After training, the learned policy is deployed on a real UAV platform
and evaluated under practical conditions. Results show that the UAV can
successfully perform autonomous navigation with minimal human oversight,
demonstrating the viability of RL-based control for point-to-point drone
operations in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信任在人机交互中至关重要，但目前对影响人类对机器人信任的因素理解仍不充分，特别是机器人面部特征如何影响第一印象

Method: 通过操纵Furhat机器人的后投影面部特征，特别是眼睛形状和大小，研究其对信任感知的影响

Result: 确认眼睛形状和大小对信任感知有显著影响，婴儿脸特征能够促进信任

Conclusion: 该研究为社交机器人设计提供了重要指导，面部特征设计选择可以优化人机交互效果

Abstract: Trust and the perception of trustworthiness play an important role in
decision-making and our behaviour towards others, and this is true not only of
human-human interactions but also of human-robot interactions. While
significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of social
robotics, there is still some way to go before we fully understand the factors
that influence human trust in robots. This paper presents the results of a
study into the first impressions created by a social robot's facial features,
based on the hypothesis that a `babyface' engenders trust. By manipulating the
back-projected face of a Furhat robot, the study confirms that eye shape and
size have a significant impact on the perception of trustworthiness. The work
thus contributes to an understanding of the design choices that need to be made
when developing social robots so as to optimise the effectiveness of
human-robot interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SHaRe-RL是一个强化学习框架，通过整合多种先验知识（技能结构化、人类演示和力控边界），实现了高效安全的在线学习，解决了HMLV工业装配中接触密集型任务的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMLV工业装配需要高精度、安全性和灵活性，但现有机器人系统难以同时满足这些要求。手动编程成本高且脆弱，而基于学习的方法样本效率低且探索不安全。

Method: SHaRe-RL框架整合三个关键要素：(i)将技能结构化为操作原语，(ii)融入人类演示和在线修正，(iii)通过轴向柔顺性限制交互力。

Result: 在0.2-0.4mm间隙的工业Harting连接器插入实验中，SHaRe-RL在实用时间预算内实现了可靠性能。

Conclusion: 过程专业知识（无需机器人或RL知识）可以显著促进学习，使RL在工业装配中的部署更安全、鲁棒和经济可行。

Abstract: High-mix low-volume (HMLV) industrial assembly, common in small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), requires the same precision, safety, and
reliability as high-volume automation while remaining flexible to product
variation and environmental uncertainty. Current robotic systems struggle to
meet these demands. Manual programming is brittle and costly to adapt, while
learning-based methods suffer from poor sample efficiency and unsafe
exploration in contact-rich tasks. To address this, we present SHaRe-RL, a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages multiple sources of prior
knowledge. By (i) structuring skills into manipulation primitives, (ii)
incorporating human demonstrations and online corrections, and (iii) bounding
interaction forces with per-axis compliance, SHaRe-RL enables efficient and
safe online learning for long-horizon, contact-rich industrial assembly tasks.
Experiments on the insertion of industrial Harting connector modules with
0.2-0.4 mm clearance demonstrate that SHaRe-RL achieves reliable performance
within practical time budgets. Our results show that process expertise, without
requiring robotics or RL knowledge, can meaningfully contribute to learning,
enabling safer, more robust, and more economically viable deployment of RL for
industrial assembly.

Motivation: 非结构化环境和动态交互给自主停车任务带来重大挑战，需要开发能够处理复杂交互的自主停车解决方案。

Method: 构建专门的停车数据集，预训练目标条件状态编码器将感知信息映射到潜在空间，使用带有保守正则化器的离线强化学习策略优化，惩罚分布外动作。

Abstract: Autonomous parking is a critical component for achieving safe and efficient
urban autonomous driving. However, unstructured environments and dynamic
interactions pose significant challenges to autonomous parking tasks. To
address this problem, we propose SEG-Parking, a novel end-to-end offline
reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve interaction-aware autonomous
parking. Notably, a specialized parking dataset is constructed for parking
scenarios, which include those without interference from the opposite vehicle
(OV) and complex ones involving interactions with the OV. Based on this
dataset, a goal-conditioned state encoder is pretrained to map the fused
perception information into the latent space. Then, an offline RL policy is
optimized with a conservative regularizer that penalizes out-of-distribution
actions. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity
CARLA simulator. Comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of
our framework with the highest success rate and robust generalization to
out-of-distribution parking scenarios. The related dataset and source code will
be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了MetricNet来解决生成式导航策略的两个结构性问题：轨迹缺乏度量基础和短视控制策略。通过预测路标点间的度量距离，将策略输出锚定到真实世界坐标，显著提升了导航和探索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式导航策略存在两个结构性问题：1)采样轨迹存在于抽象无尺度空间，缺乏度量基础；2)控制策略丢弃完整路径，只朝向单个路标点移动，导致短视和不安全行为。

Method: 提出MetricNet作为生成式导航的附加模块，预测路标点间的度量距离，将策略输出锚定到真实世界坐标。进一步提出MetricNav，将MetricNet集成到导航策略中，引导机器人避开障碍物同时朝向目标移动。

Result: 在仿真环境中使用新的基准框架评估，执行MetricNet缩放的路标点显著提高了导航和探索性能。在真实世界实验中进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MetricNet通过提供度量基础解决了生成式导航的关键限制，MetricNav集成方案能够同时实现避障和目标导向移动，提升了导航系统的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Generative navigation policies have made rapid progress in improving
end-to-end learned navigation. Despite their promising results, this paradigm
has two structural problems. First, the sampled trajectories exist in an
abstract, unscaled space without metric grounding. Second, the control strategy
discards the full path, instead moving directly towards a single waypoint. This
leads to short-sighted and unsafe actions, moving the robot towards obstacles
that a complete and correctly scaled path would circumvent. To address these
issues, we propose MetricNet, an effective add-on for generative navigation
that predicts the metric distance between waypoints, grounding policy outputs
in real-world coordinates. We evaluate our method in simulation with a new
benchmarking framework and show that executing MetricNet-scaled waypoints
significantly improves both navigation and exploration performance. Beyond
simulation, we further validate our approach in real-world experiments.
Finally, we propose MetricNav, which integrates MetricNet into a navigation
policy to guide the robot away from obstacles while still moving towards the
goal.

TL;DR: 基于BIM结构前知的RGB-D SLAM系统，通过将检测到的墙体与BIM模型对应关系作为约束来减少视觉SLAM在建筑环境中的偏移错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑工地监测需要将实际建造状态与设计图纸对齐，以及时发现错误。视觉SLAM虽然轻便实用，但在建筑环境中遇到重复布局、遮挡和缺少纹理结构时容易产生偏移

Method: 提出一种RGB-D SLAM系统，将建筑信息模型(BIM)作为结构前知知识。系统持续建立检测到的墙体与BIM模型对应关系，并将这些对应关系作为约束引入到后端优化中

Result: 在实际建筑工地上验证，与基础视觉SLAM方法相比，轨迹错误平均减少23.71%，地图RMSE减少7.14%。系统能够实时运行

Conclusion: BIM约束能够在部分建造条件下供地面上实现可靠的数字计划与实际场景对齐，有效提升了视觉SLAM在建筑环境中的稳定性和准确性

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a key tool for monitoring
construction sites, where aligning the evolving as-built state with the
as-planned design enables early error detection and reduces costly rework.
LiDAR-based SLAM achieves high geometric precision, but its sensors are
typically large and power-demanding, limiting their use on portable platforms.
Visual SLAM offers a practical alternative with lightweight cameras already
embedded in most mobile devices. however, visually mapping construction
environments remains challenging: repetitive layouts, occlusions, and
incomplete or low-texture structures often cause drift in the trajectory map.
To mitigate this, we propose an RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates the
Building Information Model (BIM) as structural prior knowledge. Instead of
relying solely on visual cues, our system continuously establishes
correspondences between detected wall and their BIM counterparts, which are
then introduced as constraints in the back-end optimization. The proposed
method operates in real time and has been validated on real construction sites,
reducing trajectory error by an average of 23.71% and map RMSE by 7.14%
compared to visual SLAM baselines. These results demonstrate that BIM
constraints enable reliable alignment of the digital plan with the as-built
scene, even under partially constructed conditions.

Conclusion: 该设计提供了一种成本更低、结构更简单的替代方案，为利用连接表面灵活性的新型操纳策略开启了新机会

Abstract: Object manipulation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, where systems
must balance trade-offs among manipulation capabilities, system complexity, and
throughput. Distributed manipulator systems (DMS) use the coordinated motion of
actuator arrays to perform complex object manipulation tasks, seeing widespread
exploration within the literature and in industry. However, existing DMS
designs typically rely on high actuator densities and impose constraints on
object-to-actuator scale ratios, limiting their adaptability. We present a
novel DMS design utilizing an array of 3-DoF, origami-inspired robotic tiles
interconnected by a compliant surface layer. Unlike conventional DMS, our
approach enables manipulation not only at the actuator end effectors but also
across a flexible surface connecting all actuators; creating a continuous,
controllable manipulation surface. We analyse the combined workspace of such a
system, derive simple motion primitives, and demonstrate its capabilities to
translate simple geometric objects across an array of tiles. By leveraging the
inter-tile connective material, our approach significantly reduces actuator
density, increasing the area over which an object can be manipulated by x1.84
without an increase in the number of actuators. This design offers a lower cost
and complexity alternative to traditional high-density arrays, and introduces
new opportunities for manipulation strategies that leverage the flexibility of
the interconnected surface.

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots with integrated manipulators hold great promise for
mobile manipulation in logistics, industrial automation, and human-robot
collaboration. However, unified control of such systems remains challenging due
to the redundancy in degrees of freedom, complex wheel-ground contact dynamics,
and the need for seamless coordination between locomotion and manipulation. In
this work, we present the design and whole-body motion control of an
omnidirectional wheel-legged quadrupedal robot equipped with a dexterous
manipulator. The proposed platform incorporates independently actuated steering
modules and hub-driven wheels, enabling agile omnidirectional locomotion with
high maneuverability in structured environments. To address the challenges of
contact-rich interaction, we develop a contact-aware whole-body dynamic
optimization framework that integrates point-contact modeling for manipulation
with line-contact modeling for wheel-ground interactions. A warm-start strategy
is introduced to accelerate online optimization, ensuring real-time feasibility
for high-dimensional control. Furthermore, a unified kinematic model tailored
for the robot's 4WIS-4WID actuation scheme eliminates the need for mode
switching across different locomotion strategies, improving control consistency
and robustness. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed framework, demonstrating agile terrain traversal, high-speed
omnidirectional mobility, and precise manipulation under diverse scenarios,
underscoring the system's potential for factory automation, urban logistics,
and service robotics in semi-structured environments.

Conclusion: TransforMARS框架实现了更灵活和实用的可行重构，能够处理任意形状的MARS系统并容忍多个转子和单元故障，同时保持连续空中稳定性

Abstract: Modular Aerial Robot Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone modules that
are physically bound together to form a single structure for flight. Exploiting
structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to
mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS
self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins
to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We
propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that
transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while
ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to
first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty
units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS
units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more
flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in
challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial
improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse
configurations and the number of faults tolerated. The videos and source code

Conclusion: Prompt2Auto框架成功实现了从单次运动提示中学习几何不变表示，为机器人技能学习提供了高效且通用的解决方案

Abstract: Learning from demonstration allows robots to acquire complex skills from
human demonstrations, but conventional approaches often require large datasets
and fail to generalize across coordinate transformations. In this paper, we
propose Prompt2Auto, a geometry-invariant one-shot Gaussian process (GeoGP)
learning framework that enables robots to perform human-guided automated
control from a single motion prompt. A dataset-construction strategy based on
coordinate transformations is introduced that enforces invariance to
translation, rotation, and scaling, while supporting multi-step predictions.
Moreover, GeoGP is robust to variations in the user's motion prompt and
supports multi-skill autonomy. We validate the proposed approach through
numerical simulations with the designed user graphical interface and two
real-world robotic experiments, which demonstrate that the proposed method is
effective, generalizes across tasks, and significantly reduces the
demonstration burden. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Autonomous aircraft must safely operate in untowered airspace, where
coordination relies on voice-based communication among human pilots. Safe
operation requires an aircraft to predict the intent, and corresponding goal
location, of other aircraft. This paper introduces a multimodal framework for
aircraft goal prediction that integrates natural language understanding with
spatial reasoning to improve autonomous decision-making in such environments.
We leverage automatic speech recognition and large language models to
transcribe and interpret pilot radio calls, identify aircraft, and extract
discrete intent labels. These intent labels are fused with observed
trajectories to condition a temporal convolutional network and Gaussian mixture
model for probabilistic goal prediction. Our method significantly reduces goal
prediction error compared to baselines that rely solely on motion history,
demonstrating that language-conditioned prediction increases prediction
accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset from an untowered airport
validate the approach and highlight its potential to enable socially aware,
language-conditioned robotic motion planning.

Conclusion: 约束一致的扭矩控制有潜力提高手术机器人的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise
enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool
manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and
interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either
lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM
constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque
controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds
it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies
task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking
while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is
validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is
benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM
constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by
improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under
clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable
insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings
demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance
safety and reliability in surgical robotics. The project page is available at:

facilitating the creation of large-scale training datasets without the high
cost of real-world data collection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the
generated trajectories are physically plausible and executable, with a mean
position error of 0.25 m (RMSE 0.28 m) and a mean orientation error of 0.19 rad
(RMSE 0.24 rad). This approach enables improved policy learning and dataset
scalability, leading to superior performance in downstream navigation tasks.
Results in simulated environments highlight enhanced robustness, smoother
trajectory planning, and adaptability to unseen conditions. An ANOVA revealed
no statistically significant difference between performance in simulation and
reality (F(1, 16) = 0.394, p = 0.541), with success rates of M = 0.628 (SD =
0.162) and M = 0.617 (SD = 0.177), respectively, indicating strong sim-to-real
transfer. The generated datasets provide a valuable resource for future UAV
research. This work introduces diffusion-based reasoning as a promising
paradigm for unifying navigation, action generation, and data synthesis in
aerial robotics.

TL;DR: GeoAware-VLA通过集成几何先验增强VLA模型视角不变性，无需训练视觉编码器或3D数据，使用预训练几何视觉模型提取特征，显著提升新相机视角的零样本泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型难以从2D图像推断稳健的3D几何，导致在新相机视角下泛化能力差，需要增强几何感知能力

Method: 利用冻结的预训练几何视觉模型作为特征提取器，通过可训练投影层将几何丰富特征适配到策略解码器，避免从头学习3D一致性

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，新视角零样本泛化成功率提升2倍以上，在真实机器人上从未见相机角度评估也显示显著性能提升

Conclusion: 稳健的几何基础是创建更具泛化能力机器人代理的关键组件，该方法在连续和离散动作空间均有效

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel camera
viewpoints, a limitation stemming from their difficulty in inferring robust 3D
geometry from 2D images. We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective
approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric
priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or
relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision
model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these
geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden
of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on
LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial
improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting
success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to
the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real
robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves
effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that
robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable
robotic agents.

TL;DR: CrazyMARL是一个去中心化强化学习框架，用于多无人机协同运输缆绳悬挂载荷，解决了传统方法难以处理的缆绳松弛-绷紧模式转换问题，在扰动抑制和跟踪精度方面优于经典控制器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多无人机协同运输缆绳悬挂载荷具有提升载荷能力、适应不同载荷形状和内置顺应性等优势，但在扰动、非线性载荷动力学和缆绳松弛-绷紧模式转换下的协调控制仍是一个挑战性难题。

Method: 提出了CrazyMARL去中心化强化学习框架，通过强化学习训练多无人机协同控制策略，能够处理缆绳模式转换等复杂动力学问题。

Result: 仿真结果显示学习策略在扰动抑制和跟踪精度方面优于经典去中心化控制器，从恶劣条件下的恢复率达到80%（基线方法为44%），并成功实现了零样本仿真到现实的迁移。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在非结构化环境中执行复杂载荷任务的自适应、弹性无人机团队铺平了道路，证明了强化学习在多无人机协同控制中的有效性。

Abstract: Collaborative transportation of cable-suspended payloads by teams of Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has the potential to enhance payload capacity, adapt to
different payload shapes, and provide built-in compliance, making it attractive
for applications ranging from disaster relief to precision logistics. However,
multi-UAV coordination under disturbances, nonlinear payload dynamics, and
slack--taut cable modes remains a challenging control problem. To our
knowledge, no prior work has addressed these cable mode transitions in the
multi-UAV context, instead relying on simplifying rigid-link assumptions. We
propose CrazyMARL, a decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
multi-UAV cable-suspended payload transport. Simulation results demonstrate
that the learned policies can outperform classical decentralized controllers in
terms of disturbance rejection and tracking precision, achieving an 80%
recovery rate from harsh conditions compared to 44% for the baseline method. We
also achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate that our
policies are highly robust under harsh conditions, including wind, random
external disturbances, and transitions between slack and taut cable dynamics.
This work paves the way for autonomous, resilient UAV teams capable of
executing complex payload missions in unstructured environments.

Conclusion: 将中继作为协调核心元素能显著提升多机器人配送系统的效率，为实际物流应用提供可扩展框架

Abstract: We consider the problem of delivering multiple packages from a single pickup
depot to distinct goal locations using a homogeneous fleet of robots with
limited carrying capacity. We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner
Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks
using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay,
and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental
byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with
traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination
transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34%
compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating
relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to
enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints,
providing a scalable framework for real-world logistics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SeqVLA是一个基于π₀的完成感知视觉-语言-动作模型，通过添加轻量级检测头来感知子任务完成状态，实现自主的子任务转换，在长序列操作任务中显著提升成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型如π₀擅长连续低层控制，但缺乏识别子任务完成的内部信号，导致在顺序执行任务时容易出错。需要一种能够同时生成动作并检测子任务完成的方法。

Method: 在π₀基础架构上添加轻量级检测头，形成双头设计。研究了四种微调策略：联合vs顺序微调，全微调vs冻结骨干网络。在两个多阶段任务上进行实验。

Result: SeqVLA显著优于基线π₀和其他强基线。联合微调且不冻结骨干网络的策略产生最决定性和统计可靠的完成预测，消除了序列相关失败。

Conclusion: 将动作生成与子任务感知检测相结合对于可扩展的顺序操作至关重要，SeqVLA能够实现鲁棒的长序列执行。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks require executing multiple
interdependent subtasks in strict sequence, where errors in detecting subtask
completion can cascade into downstream failures. Existing
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as $\pi_0$ excel at continuous
low-level control but lack an internal signal for identifying when a subtask
has finished, making them brittle in sequential settings. We propose SeqVLA, a
completion-aware extension of $\pi_0$ that augments the base architecture with
a lightweight detection head perceiving whether the current subtask is
complete. This dual-head design enables SeqVLA not only to generate
manipulation actions but also to autonomously trigger transitions between
subtasks. We investigate four finetuning strategies that vary in how the action
and detection heads are optimized (joint vs. sequential finetuning) and how
pretrained knowledge is preserved (full finetuning vs. frozen backbone).
Experiments are performed on two multi-stage tasks: salad packing with seven
distinct subtasks and candy packing with four distinct subtasks. Results show
that SeqVLA significantly outperforms the baseline $\pi_0$ and other strong
baselines in overall success rate. In particular, joint finetuning with an
unfrozen backbone yields the most decisive and statistically reliable
completion predictions, eliminating sequence-related failures and enabling
robust long-horizon execution. Our results highlight the importance of coupling
action generation with subtask-aware detection for scalable sequential
manipulation.

Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作模型在处理精确任务约束（如基于数值阈值的停止）方面存在困难，缺乏明确的条件监控机制

Method: 提出CLAW框架：使用微调CLIP模型作为轻量级提示生成器监控重量读数，生成基于阈值的离散指令；通过π₀ VLA策略整合多视角相机观测生成连续机器人动作

Result: 在单物体抓取和需要双臂操作的混合物体任务中，CLAW可靠执行重量感知行为，性能优于原始π₀和微调π₀模型

Conclusion: CLAW成功将符号重量推理与高频视觉运动控制相结合，为精确约束的机器人任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising
paradigm for robotic control, enabling end-to-end policies that ground natural
language instructions into visuomotor actions. However, current VLAs often
struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric
thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by
training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this
work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that
decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a
fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously
monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based
on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$,
a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera
observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to
combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We
validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and
mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW
reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and
fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary
materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FPV目标跟踪方法依赖手工模块化设计，导致硬件过载和累积误差，特别是在目标快速加减速时严重影响跟踪性能。

Method: 使用通过可微分模拟的反向传播时间训练学习型控制策略，使无人机能在水平和垂直方向保持目标在视野中心，同时保持固定相对距离。

Conclusion: StableTracker作为一种自主空中相机解决方案，在跟踪移动目标方面表现出优异的性能和实用性。

Abstract: FPV object tracking methods heavily rely on handcraft modular designs,
resulting in hardware overload and cumulative error, which seriously degrades
the tracking performance, especially for rapidly accelerating or decelerating
targets. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a
learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the
moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using
backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the
quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both
horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance,
thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker
against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines.
Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy,
stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and
target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an
onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MIMIC-D是一种基于扩散策略的多模态多智能体模仿学习方法，采用集中训练分散执行(CTDE)范式，能够在无需显式通信的情况下实现智能体间的隐式协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人在社会中的集成度提高，需要学习多模态任务中的协调行为。传统模仿学习方法在处理多模态专家演示时难以捕捉多样化策略，而现有扩散方法通常需要集中规划或显式通信，这在现实场景中不可行。

Method: 提出MIMIC-D方法，使用扩散策略进行多智能体模仿学习。采用CTDE范式：训练时使用完整信息进行联合训练，执行时各智能体仅使用局部信息，实现隐式协调。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，该方法能够在各种任务和环境中恢复智能体间的多模态协调行为，并优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MIMIC-D方法成功解决了多智能体多模态模仿学习中的协调问题，无需显式通信即可实现有效的隐式协调，为现实世界机器人协调提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: As robots become more integrated in society, their ability to coordinate with
other robots and humans on multi-modal tasks (those with multiple valid
solutions) is crucial. We propose to learn such behaviors from expert
demonstrations via imitation learning (IL). However, when expert demonstrations
are multi-modal, standard IL approaches can struggle to capture the diverse
strategies, hindering effective coordination. Diffusion models are known to be
effective at handling complex multi-modal trajectory distributions in
single-agent systems. Diffusion models have also excelled in multi-agent
scenarios where multi-modality is more common and crucial to learning
coordinated behaviors. Typically, diffusion-based approaches require a
centralized planner or explicit communication among agents, but this assumption
can fail in real-world scenarios where robots must operate independently or
with agents like humans that they cannot directly communicate with. Therefore,
we propose MIMIC-D, a Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)
paradigm for multi-modal multi-agent imitation learning using diffusion
policies. Agents are trained jointly with full information, but execute
policies using only local information to achieve implicit coordination. We
demonstrate in both simulation and hardware experiments that our method
recovers multi-modal coordination behavior among agents in a variety of tasks
and environments, while improving upon state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Gen2Real展示了从想象视频到真实世界执行的能力，验证了各组件贡献，并支持自然语言直接指定任务，体现了方法的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation remains a challenging robotics problem, largely due to
the difficulty of collecting extensive human demonstrations for learning. In
this paper, we introduce \textsc{Gen2Real}, which replaces costly human demos
with one generated video and drives robot skill from it: it combines
demonstration generation that leverages video generation with pose and depth
estimation to yield hand-object trajectories, trajectory optimization that uses
Physics-aware Interaction Optimization Model (PIOM) to impose physics
consistency, and demonstration learning that retargets human motions to a robot
hand and stabilizes control with an anchor-based residual Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) policy. Using only generated videos, the learned policy
achieves a 77.3\% success rate on grasping tasks in simulation and demonstrates
coherent executions on a real robot. We also conduct ablation studies to
validate the contribution of each component and demonstrate the ability to
directly specify tasks using natural language, highlighting the flexibility and
robustness of \textsc{Gen2Real} in generalizing grasping skills from imagined
videos to real-world execution.

Abstract: Recent progress in dense SLAM has primarily targeted monocular setups, often
at the expense of robustness and geometric coverage. We present MCGS-SLAM, the
first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM
fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously
optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines
poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale
consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank
priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at
large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic
reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide
field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view
regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation.
These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for
high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present a cooperative aerial-ground search-and-rescue (SAR) framework that
pairs two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)
to achieve rapid victim localization and obstacle-aware navigation in unknown
environments. We dub this framework Guided Long-horizon Integrated Drone Escort
(GLIDE), highlighting the UGV's reliance on UAV guidance for long-horizon
planning. In our framework, a goal-searching UAV executes real-time onboard
victim detection and georeferencing to nominate goals for the ground platform,
while a terrain-scouting UAV flies ahead of the UGV's planned route to provide
mid-level traversability updates. The UGV fuses aerial cues with local sensing
to perform time-efficient A* planning and continuous replanning as information
arrives. Additionally, we present a hardware demonstration (using a GEM e6 golf
cart as the UGV and two X500 UAVs) to evaluate end-to-end SAR mission
performance and include simulation ablations to assess the planning stack in
isolation from detection. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit role
separation across UAVs, coupled with terrain scouting and guided planning,

Conclusion: 该分布式框架通过机器学习模型和基于信息的控制策略，有效解决了复杂流动环境中多机器人源定位的计算和建模挑战

Abstract: Source localization in a complex flow poses a significant challenge for
multi-robot teams tasked with localizing the source of chemical leaks or
tracking the dispersion of an oil spill. The flow dynamics can be time-varying
and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and
complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model
and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes
that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally
intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is
limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source
localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element
model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are
used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an
infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to
maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach
achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and
results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine
learning approaches.

Motivation: 生态系统的复杂多尺度动力学挑战传统建模方法，需要新方法来捕捉时间振荡和涌现的时空模式，同时遵守守恒原理。

Method: USPIL框架整合物理信息神经网络(PINNs)和守恒定律，使用自动微分强制执行物理约束，自适应损失加权平衡数据保真度和物理一致性，统一处理ODE和PDE系统。

Result: 在Lotka-Volterra系统中，1D时间动力学达到98.9%相关性(loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184)，2D系统捕捉复杂螺旋波(loss: 4.7656, 模式相关性: 0.94)，守恒定律遵守度在0.5%内，推理速度比数值求解器快10-50倍。

Conclusion: USPIL为多尺度生态建模开辟了新途径，是生态预测、保护规划和生态系统韧性理解的变革性工具，确立了物理信息深度学习作为强大且科学严谨的范式。

Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge
traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and
emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We
present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework,
a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across
dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary
(ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal
cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network
architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics
constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical
consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9%
correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures
complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94).
Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x
computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also
enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints,
facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with
purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional
formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These
capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting,
conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing
physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous
paradigm.

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly complex and computationally
demanding, understanding the environmental impact of training decisions becomes
critical for sustainable AI development. This paper presents a comprehensive
empirical study investigating the relationship between optimizer choice and
energy efficiency in neural network training. We conducted 360 controlled
experiments across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) using
eight popular optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adamax,
NAdam) with 15 random seeds each. Using CodeCarbon for precise energy tracking
on Apple M1 Pro hardware, we measured training duration, peak memory usage,
carbon dioxide emissions, and final model performance. Our findings reveal
substantial trade-offs between training speed, accuracy, and environmental
impact that vary across datasets and model complexity. We identify AdamW and
NAdam as consistently efficient choices, while SGD demonstrates superior

TL;DR: 使用混合DeepONet-Transolver框架解决PET瓶压压扣扣曲问题，能够同时预测节点位移场和反力时间演化，在多参数瓶设计中达到低误差预测效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在复杂几何域上的通用性有限，而传统有限元分果计算成本昂贵，需要发展高效的代理模型

Method: 提出混合DeepONet-Transolver框架，在两个瓶设计家族上进行评估，使用Abaqus非线性FEA模拟生成254个唯一设计的训练数据

Result: 四参数瓶家族的位移场相对L²误差2.5-13%，时间变化反力误差约2.4%，绝对位移误差10的-4次方到10的-3次方，准确捕捉了扣扣行为等关键物理现象

Conclusion: 该框架作为可扩展、计算高效的代理模型，在计算力学多任务预测和快速设计评估应用中具有强大潜力

Abstract: Neural surrogates and operator networks for solving partial differential
equation (PDE) problems have attracted significant research interest in recent
years. However, most existing approaches are limited in their ability to
generalize solutions across varying non-parametric geometric domains. In this
work, we address this challenge in the context of Polyethylene Terephthalate
(PET) bottle buckling analysis, a representative packaging design problem
conventionally solved using computationally expensive finite element analysis
(FEA). We introduce a hybrid DeepONet-Transolver framework that simultaneously
predicts nodal displacement fields and the time evolution of reaction forces
during top load compression. Our methodology is evaluated on two families of
bottle geometries parameterized by two and four design variables. Training data
is generated using nonlinear FEA simulations in Abaqus for 254 unique designs
per family. The proposed framework achieves mean relative $L^{2}$ errors of
2.5-13% for displacement fields and approximately 2.4% for time-dependent
reaction forces for the four-parameter bottle family. Point-wise error analyses
further show absolute displacement errors on the order of $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$,
with the largest discrepancies confined to localized geometric regions.
Importantly, the model accurately captures key physical phenomena, such as
buckling behavior, across diverse bottle geometries. These results highlight
the potential of our framework as a scalable and computationally efficient
surrogate, particularly for multi-task predictions in computational mechanics
and applications requiring rapid design evaluation.

shard window-based transformers without added communication cost or increased

Motivation: 解决化学结构-性质关系中高质量数据集有限的问题，同时满足可解释AI的需求，弥合预测准确性和人类可理解性之间的差距

Method: 采用元学习框架，识别相关任务间的共享模型参数，学习共同的功能流形作为新任务的更明智起点，即使任务间不共享数据

Conclusion: LAMeL是化学性质预测中既准确又可解释的可靠工具，特别适合需要同时保证准确性和可解释性的场景

Abstract: Chemists in search of structure-property relationships face great challenges
due to limited high quality, concordant datasets. Machine learning (ML) has
significantly advanced predictive capabilities in chemical sciences, but these
modern data-driven approaches have increased the demand for data. In response
to the growing demand for explainable AI (XAI) and to bridge the gap between
predictive accuracy and human comprehensibility, we introduce LAMeL - a Linear
Algorithm for Meta-Learning that preserves interpretability while improving the
prediction accuracy across multiple properties. While most approaches treat
each chemical prediction task in isolation, LAMeL leverages a meta-learning
framework to identify shared model parameters across related tasks, even if
those tasks do not share data, allowing it to learn a common functional
manifold that serves as a more informed starting point for new unseen tasks.
Our method delivers performance improvements ranging from 1.1- to 25-fold over
standard ridge regression, depending on the domain of the dataset. While the
degree of performance enhancement varies across tasks, LAMeL consistently
outperforms or matches traditional linear methods, making it a reliable tool
for chemical property prediction where both accuracy and interpretability are
critical.

TL;DR: 该文童通过对GPT-4o mini的系统分析，发现了多模态模型安全架构中存在"单模态瓶颈"，安全过滤器在缺乏上下文感知的情况下系统性地预先于多模态推理进行拒绝判断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型多模态模型在日常数字生活中的普及，理解其安全架构成为AI对齐领域的关键问题。需要系统性分析这些模型在多模态恨恨言语检测任务中的表现和失败模式

Method: 使用Hateful Memes Challenge数据集，对500个样本进行多阶段调查，探索模型的推理过程和失败模式，并对144个内容政策拒绝进行定量验证

Result: 实验证明存在"单模态瓶颈"，安全过滤器在缺乏上下文感知的情况下系统性地预先于多模态推理，其50%由单模态视觉内容触发，50%由单模态文本内容触发，并导致可预测的假正确

Conclusion: 这些发现曝露了现有最先进LMM模型在能力与安全之间的根本张力，强调需要更集成、具有上下文感知能力的对齐策略，确保AI系统既安全又有效地部署

Abstract: As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become integral to daily digital life,
understanding their safety architectures is a critical problem for AI
Alignment. This paper presents a systematic analysis of OpenAI's GPT-4o mini, a
globally deployed model, on the difficult task of multimodal hate speech
detection. Using the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset, we conduct a multi-phase
investigation on 500 samples to probe the model's reasoning and failure modes.
Our central finding is the experimental identification of a "Unimodal
Bottleneck," an architectural flaw where the model's advanced multimodal
reasoning is systematically preempted by context-blind safety filters. A
quantitative validation of 144 content policy refusals reveals that these
overrides are triggered in equal measure by unimodal visual 50% and textual 50%
content. We further demonstrate that this safety system is brittle, blocking
not only high-risk imagery but also benign, common meme formats, leading to
predictable false positives. These findings expose a fundamental tension
between capability and safety in state-of-the-art LMMs, highlighting the need
for more integrated, context-aware alignment strategies to ensure AI systems
can be deployed both safely and effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language
understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential
exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of
information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information
embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction
framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy
guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to
ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring
any fine-tuning of the underlying models.The proposed method performs inference
on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions.
This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while
maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending
operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance
utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it
a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining
high utility.

Conclusion: 展示了理论驱动的离散选择模型与数据驱动的AI模型相结合的统一方法潜力，可在保持规划政策适用性的同时获得更准确的模型

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of deep learning models in multitude of
applications, their adaption in planning and policy related areas remains
challenging due to the black-box nature of these models. In this work, we
develop a set of DeepLogit models that follow a novel sequentially constrained
approach in estimating deep learning models for transport policy analysis. In
the first step of the proposed approach, we estimate a convolutional neural
network (CNN) model with only linear terms, which is equivalent of a
linear-in-parameter multinomial logit model. We then estimate other deep
learning models by constraining the parameters that need interpretability at
the values obtained in the linear-in-parameter CNN model and including higher
order terms or by introducing advanced deep learning architectures like
Transformers. Our approach can retain the interpretability of the selected
parameters, yet provides significantly improved model accuracy than the
discrete choice model. We demonstrate our approach on a transit route choice
example using real-world transit smart card data from Singapore. This study
shows the potential for a unifying approach, where theory-based discrete choice
model (DCM) and data-driven AI models can leverage each other's strengths in
interpretability and predictive power. With the availability of larger datasets
and more complex constructions, such approach can lead to more accurate models
using discrete choice models while maintaining its applicability in planning
and policy-related areas. Our code is available on

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained popularity as a privacy-preserving method
of training machine learning models on decentralized networks. However to
ensure reliable operation of UAV-assisted FL systems, issues like as excessive
energy consumption, communication inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities
must be solved. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates
Digital Twin (DT) technology and Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning (zkFed) to
tackle these challenges. UAVs act as mobile base stations, allowing scattered
devices to train FL models locally and upload model updates for aggregation. By
incorporating DT technology, our approach enables real-time system monitoring
and predictive maintenance, improving UAV network efficiency. Additionally,
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) strengthen security by allowing model verification
without exposing sensitive data. To optimize energy efficiency and resource
management, we introduce a dynamic allocation strategy that adjusts UAV flight
paths, transmission power, and processing rates based on network conditions.
Using block coordinate descent and convex optimization techniques, our method
significantly reduces system energy consumption by up to 29.6% compared to
conventional FL approaches. Simulation results demonstrate improved learning
performance, security, and scalability, positioning this framework as a
promising solution for next-generation UAV-based intelligent networks.

Conclusion: 该图像基转换方法不仅适用于压力检测，还可应用于任何多模态生理信号领域，为可穿戴健康监测开启了更准确、个性化的实时监测新方向

Abstract: This study introduces a novel method that transforms multimodal physiological
signalsphotoplethysmography (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and
acceleration (ACC) into 2D image matrices to enhance stress detection using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional approaches that
process these signals separately or rely on fixed encodings, our technique
fuses them into structured image representations that enable CNNs to capture
temporal and cross signal dependencies more effectively. This image based
transformation not only improves interpretability but also serves as a robust
form of data augmentation. To further enhance generalization and model
robustness, we systematically reorganize the fused signals into multiple
formats, combining them in a multi stage training pipeline. This approach
significantly boosts classification performance. While demonstrated here in the
context of stress detection, the proposed method is broadly applicable to any
domain involving multimodal physiological signals, paving the way for more
accurate, personalized, and real time health monitoring through wearable
technologies.

Conclusion: LLM-Interleaved框架成功解决了多模态生成中的工具协调问题，为动态和事实基础的多模态内容生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I), a flexible and dynamic framework that
reframes interleaved image-text generation as a tool-use problem. LLM-I is
designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which
are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual
grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or
MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual
tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code
execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these
tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a
hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and
MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model
backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a
novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains.

Method: 提出GenPAS框架，将数据增强建模为输入-目标对的随机采样过程，包含三个偏差控制步骤：序列采样、目标采样和输入采样，统一了现有广泛使用的策略。

Result: 在基准和工业数据集上的广泛实验表明，GenPAS在准确性、数据效率和参数效率方面均优于现有策略。

Conclusion: GenPAS为生成式推荐中的训练数据构建提供了原则性指导，通过系统化的数据增强框架显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation plays a crucial role in personalized systems,
predicting users' future interactions from their historical behavior sequences.
A critical yet underexplored factor in training these models is data
augmentation, the process of constructing training data from user interaction
histories. By shaping the training distribution, data augmentation directly and
often substantially affects model generalization and performance. Nevertheless,
in much of the existing work, this process is simplified, applied
inconsistently, or treated as a minor design choice, without a systematic and
principled understanding of its effects.
  Motivated by our empirical finding that different augmentation strategies can
yield large performance disparities, we conduct an in-depth analysis of how
they reshape training distributions and influence alignment with future targets
and generalization to unseen inputs. To systematize this design space, we
propose GenPAS, a generalized and principled framework that models augmentation
as a stochastic sampling process over input-target pairs with three
bias-controlled steps: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling.
This formulation unifies widely used strategies as special cases and enables
flexible control of the resulting training distribution. Our extensive
experiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate that GenPAS yields
superior accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to
existing strategies, providing practical guidance for principled training data
construction in generative recommendation.

Conclusion: CPT方法能够有效训练模型根据用户偏好执行不同的权衡，精确遵循人工定义的参考向量

Abstract: The fairness-accuracy trade-off is a key challenge in NLP tasks. Current work
focuses on finding a single "optimal" solution to balance the two objectives,
which is limited considering the diverse solutions on the Pareto front. This
work intends to provide controllable trade-offs according to the user's
preference of the two objectives, which is defined as a reference vector. To
achieve this goal, we apply multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can find
solutions from various regions of the Pareto front. However, it is challenging
to precisely control the trade-off due to the stochasticity of the training
process and the high dimentional gradient vectors. Thus, we propose
Controllable Pareto Trade-off (CPT) that can effectively train models to
perform different trade-offs according to users' preferences. CPT 1) stabilizes
the fairness update with a moving average of stochastic gradients to determine
the update direction, and 2) prunes the gradients by only keeping the gradients
of the critical parameters. We evaluate CPT on hate speech detection and
occupation classification tasks. Experiments show that CPT can achieve a
higher-quality set of solutions on the Pareto front than the baseline methods.
It also exhibits better controllability and can precisely follow the
human-defined reference vectors.

Conclusion: RF-LSCM通过创新的辐射场建模方法和高效的计算架构，成功解决了传统信道建模的局限性，为蜂窝网络优化提供了更准确和高效的信道建模解决方案

Abstract: Accurate localized wireless channel modeling is a cornerstone of cellular
network optimization, enabling reliable prediction of network performance
during parameter tuning. Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is the
state-of-the-art channel modeling framework tailored for cellular network
optimization. However, traditional LSCM methods, which infer the channel's
Angular Power Spectrum (APS) from Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)
measurements, suffer from critical limitations: they are typically confined to
single-cell, single-grid and single-carrier frequency analysis and fail to
capture complex cross-domain interactions. To overcome these challenges, we
propose RF-LSCM, a novel framework that models the channel APS by jointly
representing large-scale signal attenuation and multipath components within a
radiance field. RF-LSCM introduces a multi-domain LSCM formulation with a
physics-informed frequency-dependent Attenuation Model (FDAM) to facilitate the
cross frequency generalization as well as a point-cloud-aided environment
enhanced method to enable multi-cell and multi-grid channel modeling.
Furthermore, to address the computational inefficiency of typical neural
radiance fields, RF-LSCM leverages a low-rank tensor representation,
complemented by a novel Hierarchical Tensor Angular Modeling (HiTAM) algorithm.
This efficient design significantly reduces GPU memory requirements and
training time while preserving fine-grained accuracy. Extensive experiments on
real-world multi-cell datasets demonstrate that RF-LSCM significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 30% reduction in mean
absolute error (MAE) for coverage prediction and a 22% MAE improvement by
effectively fusing multi-frequency data.

Motivation: 现有的PINNs不确定性量化方法缺乏严格的统计保证，需要一种能够提供有限样本覆盖保证的分布无关方法来解决PDE求解中的不确定性量化问题。

Method: 引入分布无关的共形预测框架，通过在校准集上构建非共形性分数来校准预测区间，并进一步提出局部共形分位数估计来处理空间异方差性。

Result: 在典型PDE系统（阻尼谐振子、泊松、Allen-Cahn和亥姆霍兹方程）上的系统评估表明，该框架实现了可靠的校准和局部自适应不确定性区间，一致优于启发式UQ方法。

Conclusion: 通过将PINNs与分布无关UQ相结合，该工作不仅提高了校准和可靠性，还为复杂PDE系统的不确定性感知建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving PDEs, yet existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for
PINNs generally lack rigorous statistical guarantees. In this work, we bridge
this gap by introducing a distribution-free conformal prediction (CP) framework
for UQ in PINNs. This framework calibrates prediction intervals by constructing
nonconformity scores on a calibration set, thereby yielding distribution-free
uncertainty estimates with rigorous finite-sample coverage guarantees for
PINNs. To handle spatial heteroskedasticity, we further introduce local
conformal quantile estimation, enabling spatially adaptive uncertainty bands
while preserving theoretical guarantee. Through systematic evaluations on
typical PDEs (damped harmonic oscillator, Poisson, Allen-Cahn, and Helmholtz

TL;DR: 通过智能手表系统和心率数据预测社交焦虑悥者的时刻焦虑波动，达到60.4%的平衡准确率，且在外部数据集上也表现良好的可推广性。

Motivation: 社交焦虑导致学术、社交和职业功能障碍，但之前少有研究测量或预测日常生活中的时刻焦虑波动。捐描这些动态变化对设计实时个性化干预措施至关重要。

Method: 使用自定制智能手表系统收集91名社交焦虑大学生数据，每日7次环境矮矮评估。基于外部10,000天心率数据建立基础模型，转移表征并微调，结合特质水平测量构建元学习器。

Result: 在本研究数据集上达到60.4%平衡准确率，在TILES-18数据集上达到59.1%平衡准确率，比之前研究提高至7%以上。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过智能手表和心率数据可以有效预测社交焦虑悥者的时刻焦虑波动，为实时个性化干预提供了可靠技术支撑。

Abstract: Social anxiety is a common mental health condition linked to significant
challenges in academic, social, and occupational functioning. A core feature is
elevated momentary (state) anxiety in social situations, yet little prior work
has measured or predicted fluctuations in this anxiety throughout the day.
Capturing these intra-day dynamics is critical for designing real-time,
personalized interventions such as Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions
(JITAIs). To address this gap, we conducted a study with socially anxious
college students (N=91; 72 after exclusions) using our custom smartwatch-based
system over an average of 9.03 days (SD = 2.95). Participants received seven
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) per day to report state anxiety. We
developed a base model on over 10,000 days of external heart rate data,
transferred its representations to our dataset, and fine-tuned it to generate
probabilistic predictions. These were combined with trait-level measures in a
meta-learner. Our pipeline achieved 60.4% balanced accuracy in state anxiety
detection in our dataset. To evaluate generalizability, we applied the training
approach to a separate hold-out set from the TILES-18 dataset-the same dataset
used for pretraining. On 10,095 once-daily EMAs, our method achieved 59.1%
balanced accuracy, outperforming prior work by at least 7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面向有向图的GNN和图Transformer面临两个主要挑战：有效捕捉有向边产生的长距离因果依赖关系，以及在处理大规模图数据集时平衡准确性和训练效率。现有的图状态空间模型仅适用于无向图，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出DirEgo2Token方法通过k-hop ego图将有向图序列化，并在此基础上开发DirGraphSSM架构，通过消息传递机制在有向图上实现状态空间模型。

Conclusion: DirGraphSSM成功将有向图学习与状态空间模型相结合，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了有向图学习的性能，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the
directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing
GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major
challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived
from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when
processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models
(SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their
variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while
maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However,
existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected
graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end,
we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed
graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state
space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we
develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that
implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing
mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning
tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with
1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing
state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: ParaAegis是一个联邦学习并行保护框架，通过模型分割策略在差分隐私和同态加密之间实现灵活权衡，让用户能够调节隐私-效用-效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习保护机制（如差分隐私和同态加密）存在刚性权衡，必须在模型效用和计算效率之间做出选择，缺乏灵活性阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 采用策略性模型分割方案：对模型中不太重要的低范数部分应用轻量级差分隐私，而对剩余部分使用同态加密保护，通过分布式投票机制确保分割共识。

Result: 理论分析确认了在相同隐私保护下效率与效用之间的可调节性。实验结果表明，通过调整超参数，该方法能够灵活地在模型准确性和训练时间之间进行优先排序。

Conclusion: ParaAegis框架为联邦学习提供了灵活的保护机制，解决了现有方法在隐私-效用-效率权衡方面的刚性限制，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces a critical dilemma: existing protection
mechanisms like differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE)
enforce a rigid trade-off, forcing a choice between model utility and
computational efficiency. This lack of flexibility hinders the practical
implementation. To address this, we introduce ParaAegis, a parallel protection
framework designed to give practitioners flexible control over the
privacy-utility-efficiency balance. Our core innovation is a strategic model
partitioning scheme. By applying lightweight DP to the less critical, low norm
portion of the model while protecting the remainder with HE, we create a
tunable system. A distributed voting mechanism ensures consensus on this
partitioning. Theoretical analysis confirms the adjustments between efficiency
and utility with the same privacy. Crucially, the experimental results
demonstrate that by adjusting the hyperparameters, our method enables flexible
prioritization between model accuracy and training time.

Motivation: 大语言模型在交通预测中表现出潜力，但其主要为序列标记处理设计，难以有效捕获空间依赖关系，特别是在建模空间关系和图结构空间数据方面存在架构不兼容问题

Method: 提出ST-LINK框架，包含两个关键组件：空间增强注意力（SE-Attention）通过旋转位置嵌入将空间相关性作为直接旋转变换集成到注意力机制中；记忆检索前馈网络（MRFFN）动态检索和利用关键历史模式来捕获复杂时间依赖

Conclusion: ST-LINK成功解决了LLM在交通预测中的空间建模限制，通过创新的空间增强机制和动态历史模式检索，显著提升了时空依赖的捕获能力

Abstract: Traffic forecasting represents a crucial problem within intelligent
transportation systems. In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily
for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively
capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs
in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with
graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the
capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies.
Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the
Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary
position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational
transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial
learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure.
Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to
capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term
forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and
effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.

Conclusion: 这是首个在无监督设置下对因果多视图特征选择的深入研究，CAUSA方法通过因果视角有效解决了虚假相关问题，提升了特征选择性能。

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently received
increasing attention for its promising ability in dimensionality reduction on
multi-view unlabeled data. Existing MUFS methods typically select
discriminative features by capturing correlations between features and
clustering labels. However, an important yet underexplored question remains:
\textit{Are such correlations sufficiently reliable to guide feature
selection?} In this paper, we analyze MUFS from a causal perspective by
introducing a novel structural causal model, which reveals that existing
methods may select irrelevant features because they overlook spurious
correlations caused by confounders. Building on this causal perspective, we
propose a novel MUFS method called CAusal multi-view Unsupervised feature
Selection leArning (CAUSA). Specifically, we first employ a generalized
unsupervised spectral regression model that identifies informative features by
capturing dependencies between features and consensus clustering labels. We
then introduce a causal regularization module that can adaptively separate
confounders from multi-view data and simultaneously learn view-shared sample
weights to balance confounder distributions, thereby mitigating spurious
correlations. Thereafter, integrating both into a unified learning framework
enables CAUSA to select causally informative features. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that CAUSA outperforms several state-of-the-art
methods. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of causal
multi-view feature selection in the unsupervised setting.

Conclusion: FHNN圤平了黑盒学习与透明系统识别之间的差距，通过物理结构设计提高了解释性和集成稳定性

Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction is common in engineering and natural systems,
where floating-body motion is governed by added mass, drag, and background
flows. Modeling these dissipative dynamics is difficult: black-box neural
models regress state derivatives with limited interpretability and unstable
long-horizon predictions. We propose Floating-Body Hydrodynamic Neural Networks
(FHNN), a physics-structured framework that predicts interpretable hydrodynamic
parameters such as directional added masses, drag coefficients, and a
streamfunction-based flow, and couples them with analytic equations of motion.
This design constrains the hypothesis space, enhances interpretability, and
stabilizes integration. On synthetic vortex datasets, FHNN achieves up to an
order-of-magnitude lower error than Neural ODEs, recovers physically consistent
flow fields. Compared with Hamiltonian and Lagrangian neural networks, FHNN
more effectively handles dissipative dynamics while preserving
interpretability, which bridges the gap between black-box learning and
transparent system identification.

Conclusion: 证明了单一模型从数据中学习通用物理原理的可行性，为建立通用物理基础模型开启了新路径

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a
``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model
adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics
Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to
high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating
the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine
learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and
require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics
Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that
demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key
insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from
context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock
waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the
underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior
performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized
architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen
physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term
predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model
can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens
the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and
engineering.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers a new paradigm for addressing complex
financial problems intractable for classical methods. This work specifically
tackles the challenge of few-shot credit risk assessment, a critical issue in
inclusive finance where data scarcity and imbalance limit the effectiveness of
conventional models. To address this, we design and implement a novel hybrid
quantum-classical workflow. The methodology first employs an ensemble of
classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
for intelligent feature engineering and dimensionality reduction. Subsequently,
a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), trained via the parameter-shift rule, serves as
the core classifier. This framework was evaluated through numerical simulations
and deployed on the Quafu Quantum Cloud Platform's ScQ-P21 superconducting
processor. On a real-world credit dataset of 279 samples, our QNN achieved a
robust average AUC of 0.852 +/- 0.027 in simulations and yielded an impressive
AUC of 0.88 in the hardware experiment. This performance surpasses a suite of
classical benchmarks, with a particularly strong result on the recall metric.
This study provides a pragmatic blueprint for applying quantum computing to
data-constrained financial scenarios in the NISQ era and offers valuable
empirical evidence supporting its potential in high-stakes applications like
inclusive finance.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling
subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency,
they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit
physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are
physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to
estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex
structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end
differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a
PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance
calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat
features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for
permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric
assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The
GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in
the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using
a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by
backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation)
and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled,
end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes
well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and
traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals
physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability.
This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for
permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and
improving accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为掩码扩散模型提供了统一的理论解释，还提出了实用的调度优化方法，显著提升了采样效率。

Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked
diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in
discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy
formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are
mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize
all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition.
This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but
also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing
interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design
space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without
model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted
baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.

Motivation: 联邦学习中非IID数据和部分参与会导致客户偏移和不一致的局部最优解，影响收敛稳定性和准确性。

Conclusion: 采样统计可以转化为原理性的历史感知阶段控制方法，有效稳定和加速联邦训练。

Abstract: Non-IID data and partial participation induce client drift and inconsistent
local optima in federated learning, causing unstable convergence and accuracy
loss. We present FedSSG, a stochastic sampling-guided, history-aware drift
alignment method. FedSSG maintains a per-client drift memory that accumulates
local model differences as a lightweight sketch of historical gradients;
crucially, it gates both the memory update and the local alignment term by a
smooth function of the observed/expected participation ratio (a
phase-by-expectation signal derived from the server sampler). This
statistically grounded gate stays weak and smooth when sampling noise dominates
early, then strengthens once participation statistics stabilize, contracting
the local-global gap without extra communication. Across CIFAR-10/100 with
100/500 clients and 2-15 percent participation, FedSSG consistently outperforms
strong drift-aware baselines and accelerates convergence; on our benchmarks it
improves test accuracy by up to a few points (e.g., about +0.9 on CIFAR-10 and
about +2.7 on CIFAR-100 on average over the top-2 baseline) and yields about
4.5x faster target-accuracy convergence on average. The method adds only O(d)
client memory and a constant-time gate, and degrades gracefully to a mild
regularizer under near-IID or uniform sampling. FedSSG shows that sampling
statistics can be turned into a principled, history-aware phase control to
stabilize and speed up federated training.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型无法利用协变量信息，而协变量在许多应用中对于准确预测至关重要，因为协变量具有领域特定性且缺乏相关的归纳偏置

Method: 使用两阶段方法：1) 用简单回归模型生成伪预测；2) 训练高斯过程回归器，结合伪预测、基础模型预测和协变量来优化预测结果

Conclusion: 轻量级适配器有潜力弥合通用基础模型与领域特定预测需求之间的差距

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in univariate forecasting on new time series simply by conditioned
on a brief history of past values. Their success demonstrates that large-scale
pretraining across diverse domains can acquire the inductive bias to generalize
from temporal patterns in a brief history. However, most TSFMs are unable to
leverage covariates -- future-available exogenous variables critical for
accurate forecasting in many applications -- due to their domain-specific
nature and the lack of associated inductive bias. We propose TFMAdapter, a
lightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate
information without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on
the limited history provided during a single model call, learning a
non-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts.
However, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the
history, requiring too many calls to the TSFM. To enable training on the full
historical context while limiting TSFM invocations, TFMAdapter uses a two-stage
method: (1) generating pseudo-forecasts with a simple regression model, and (2)
training a Gaussian Process regressor to refine predictions using both pseudo-
and TSFM forecasts alongside covariates. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that TFMAdapter consistently outperforms both foundation
models and supervised baselines, achieving a 24-27\% improvement over base
foundation models with minimal data and computational overhead. Our results
highlight the potential of lightweight adapters to bridge the gap between
generic foundation models and domain-specific forecasting needs.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, especially when
biases compound across intersecting protected attributes like race, gender, and
age. While existing methods address fairness for single attributes, they fail
to capture the nuanced, multiplicative biases faced by intersectional
subgroups. We introduce Adaptive Pareto Front Explorer (APFEx), the first
framework to explicitly model intersectional fairness as a joint optimization
problem over the Cartesian product of sensitive attributes. APFEx combines
three key innovations- (1) an adaptive multi-objective optimizer that
dynamically switches between Pareto cone projection, gradient weighting, and
exploration strategies to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, (2)
differentiable intersectional fairness metrics enabling gradient-based
optimization of non-smooth subgroup disparities, and (3) theoretical guarantees
of convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate APFEx's superiority, reducing fairness violations while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work bridges a critical gap in fair ML,
providing a scalable, model-agnostic solution for intersectional fairness.

Motivation: 解决如何在不需耐付高额重新训练成本的情况下，组合不同的大型轨迹预测模型以获得更好的综合性能。

Method: 使用信心加权平均方法，直接组合现有的state-of-the-art深度学习模型（无需重新训练或微调）。

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse数据集上，性能提升10%，尤其在长尾指标上显著改善，改善效果在整个数据分布上都保持一致。

Conclusion: 简单的集成方法可以有效组合不同模型的优势，为自动驾驶预测任务提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: This work explores the application of ensemble modeling to the
multidimensional regression problem of trajectory prediction for vehicles in
urban environments. As newer and bigger state-of-the-art prediction models for
autonomous driving continue to emerge, an important open challenge is the
problem of how to combine the strengths of these big models without the need
for costly re-training. We show how, perhaps surprisingly, combining
state-of-the-art deep learning models out-of-the-box (without retraining or
fine-tuning) with a simple confidence-weighted average method can enhance the
overall prediction. Indeed, while combining trajectory prediction models is not
straightforward, this simple approach enhances performance by 10% over the best
prediction model, especially in the long-tailed metrics. We show that this
performance improvement holds on both the NuScenes and Argoverse datasets, and
that these improvements are made across the dataset distribution. The code for
our work is open source.

Motivation: 解决无线联邦学习中客户端动态状态不可观测的挑战，减少达到特定学习精度所需的总时间。

Method: 将客户端选择模型化为多臂老虎机问题，使用Q学习自适应地学习和更新每个客户端的近似Whittle指数，然后选择指数最高的客户端。

Result: 实验结果表明WILF-Q在学习效率方面显著超过现有基准策略，提供了稳健高效的客户端选择方案。

Conclusion: WILF-Q无需明确知道客户端状态迁移或数据分布，适合在实际联邦学习环境中部署，为无线联邦学习提供了优秀的客户端选择方法。

Abstract: We consider the client selection problem in wireless Federated Learning (FL),
with the objective of reducing the total required time to achieve a certain
level of learning accuracy. Since the server cannot observe the clients'
dynamic states that can change their computation and communication efficiency,
we formulate client selection as a restless multi-armed bandit problem. We
propose a scalable and efficient approach called the Whittle Index Learning in
Federated Q-learning (WILF-Q), which uses Q-learning to adaptively learn and
update an approximated Whittle index associated with each client, and then
selects the clients with the highest indices. Compared to existing approaches,
WILF-Q does not require explicit knowledge of client state transitions or data
distributions, making it well-suited for deployment in practical FL settings.
Experiment results demonstrate that WILF-Q significantly outperforms existing
baseline policies in terms of learning efficiency, providing a robust and
efficient approach to client selection in wireless FL.

Abstract: This paper presents eXtended Physics-Informed Neural Network (X-PINN), a
novel and robust framework for addressing fracture mechanics problems involving
multiple cracks in fractured media. To address this, an energy-based loss

Abstract: Objective: Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disease, demands careful
diagnosis and continuous care. Seizure detection remains challenging, as
current clinical practice relies on expert analysis of electroencephalography,
which is a time-consuming process and requires specialized knowledge.
Addressing this challenge, this paper explores automated epileptic seizure
detection using deep learning, focusing on personalized continual learning
models that adapt to each patient's unique electroencephalography signal
features, which evolve over time. Methods: In this context, our approach
addresses the challenge of integrating new data into existing models without
catastrophic forgetting, a common issue in static deep learning models. We
propose EpiSMART, a continual learning framework for seizure detection that
uses a size-constrained replay buffer and an informed sample selection strategy
to incrementally adapt to patient-specific electroencephalography signals. By
selectively retaining high-entropy and seizure-predicted samples, our method
preserves critical past information while maintaining high performance with
minimal memory and computational requirements. Results: Validation on the
CHB-MIT dataset, shows that EpiSMART achieves a 21% improvement in the F1 score
over a trained baseline without updates in all other patients. On average,
EpiSMART requires only 6.46 minutes of labeled data and 6.28 updates per day,
making it suitable for real-time deployment in wearable systems.
Conclusion:EpiSMART enables robust and personalized seizure detection under
realistic and resource-constrained conditions by effectively integrating new
data into existing models without degrading past knowledge. Significance: This
framework advances automated seizure detection by providing a continual
learning approach that supports patient-specific adaptation and practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因GNSS干扰威胁日益增加，需要在干扰环境下保持定位和时间的可用性

Method: 构建异质星形图（接收机为中心，卫星为叶节点），使用HeteroGCLSTM模型聚合空间上下文和时间动态来预测2D偏差向量

Result: 在三种干扰模式和不同功率水平下都获得最低MAE，-45dBm时达到3.64-7.74cm，-60到-70dBm时提升到1.65-2.08cm，数据效率远超基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够在强干扰环境下提供高精度定位缩正，具有良好的实时性和数据效率

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are increasingly disrupted by
intentional jamming, degrading availability precisely when positioning and
timing must remain operational. We address this by reframing jamming mitigation
as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal
graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal
deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment
is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked
satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth,
elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM
(HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a
short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly
correction.
  We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer
profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each
exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per
scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series
baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains
the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm
(GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and
4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode
datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10),
outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data
efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of
baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).

Conclusion: 客户端级差分隐私联邦学习能够提供有用的县级预测，具有强大的隐私保证，可行的隐私预算取决于流行病阶段，允许卫生当局进行隐私合规的协作

Abstract: In times of epidemics, swift reaction is necessary to mitigate epidemic
spreading. For this reaction, localized approaches have several advantages,
limiting necessary resources and reducing the impact of interventions on a
larger scale. However, training a separate machine learning (ML) model on a
local scale is often not feasible due to limited available data. Centralizing
the data is also challenging because of its high sensitivity and privacy
constraints. In this study, we consider a localized strategy based on the
German counties and communities managed by the related local health authorities
(LHA). For the preservation of privacy to not oppose the availability of
detailed situational data, we propose a privacy-preserving forecasting method
that can assist public health experts and decision makers. ML methods with
federated learning (FL) train a shared model without centralizing raw data.
Considering the counties, communities or LHAs as clients and finding a balance
between utility and privacy, we study a FL framework with client-level
differential privacy (DP). We train a shared multilayer perceptron on sliding
windows of recent case counts to forecast the number of cases, while clients
exchange only norm-clipped updates and the server aggregated updates with DP
noise. We evaluate the approach on COVID-19 data on county-level during two
phases. As expected, very strict privacy yields unstable, unusable forecasts.
At a moderately strong level, the DP model closely approaches the non-DP model:
$R^2= 0.94$ (vs. 0.95) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 26 % in
November 2020; $R^2= 0.88$ (vs. 0.93) and MAPE of 21 % in March 2022. Overall,
client-level DP-FL can deliver useful county-level predictions with strong
privacy guarantees, and viable privacy budgets depend on epidemic phase,
allowing privacy-compliant collaboration among health authorities for local
forecasting.

Abstract: A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a
clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One
such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by
measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a
nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the
structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be
used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time
identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the
complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the
issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram
images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time
information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When
tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of
~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward
practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we
demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying
these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time
disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Queen bee presence is essential for the health and stability of honeybee
colonies, yet current monitoring methods rely on manual inspections that are
labor-intensive, disruptive, and impractical for large-scale beekeeping. While
recent audio-based approaches have shown promise, they often require high power
consumption, complex preprocessing, and are susceptible to ambient noise. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight, multimodal system for
queen detection based on environmental sensor fusion-specifically, temperature,
humidity, and pressure differentials between the inside and outside of the
hive. Our approach employs quantized decision tree inference on a commercial
STM32 microcontroller, enabling real-time, low-power edge computing without
compromising accuracy. We show that our system achieves over 99% queen
detection accuracy using only environmental inputs, with audio features
offering no significant performance gain. This work presents a scalable and
sustainable solution for non-invasive hive monitoring, paving the way for
autonomous, precision beekeeping using off-the-shelf, energy-efficient
hardware.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯风险规避方法能有效处理认知不确定性，具有自适应特性，在在线学习和多臂赌博机问题中表现出良好的理论性质和实际效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Bayesian risk-averse formulation in reinforcement
learning (RL). To address the epistemic uncertainty due to a lack of data, we
adopt the Bayesian Risk Markov Decision Process (BRMDP) to account for the
parameter uncertainty of the unknown underlying model. We derive the asymptotic
normality that characterizes the difference between the Bayesian risk value
function and the original value function under the true unknown distribution.
The results indicate that the Bayesian risk-averse approach tends to
pessimistically underestimate the original value function. This discrepancy
increases with stronger risk aversion and decreases as more data become
available. We then utilize this adaptive property in the setting of online RL
as well as online contextual multi-arm bandits (CMAB), a special case of online
RL. We provide two procedures using posterior sampling for both the general RL
problem and the CMAB problem. We establish a sub-linear regret bound, with the
regret defined as the conventional regret for both the RL and CMAB settings.
Additionally, we establish a sub-linear regret bound for the CMAB setting with
the regret defined as the Bayesian risk regret. Finally, we conduct numerical
experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in
addressing epistemic uncertainty and verifying the theoretical properties.

Abstract: This study investigates classifier performance across EEG frequency bands
using various optimizers and evaluates efficient class prediction for the left
and right hemispheres. Three neural network architectures - a deep dense
network, a shallow three-layer network, and a convolutional neural network
(CNN) - are implemented and compared using the TensorFlow and PyTorch
frameworks. Results indicate that the Adagrad and RMSprop optimizers
consistently perform well across different frequency bands, with Adadelta
exhibiting robust performance in cross-model evaluations. Specifically, Adagrad
excels in the beta band, while RMSprop achieves superior performance in the
gamma band. Conversely, SGD and FTRL exhibit inconsistent performance. Among
the models, the CNN demonstrates the second highest accuracy, particularly in
capturing spatial features of EEG data. The deep dense network shows
competitive performance in learning complex patterns, whereas the shallow
three-layer network, sometimes being less accurate, provides computational
efficiency. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) plots are employed to identify
efficient class prediction, revealing nuanced contributions of EEG frequency
bands to model accuracy. Overall, the study highlights the importance of
optimizer selection, model architecture, and EEG frequency band analysis in
enhancing classifier performance and understanding feature importance in

Abstract: While neural networks are achieving high predictive accuracy in multi-horizon
probabilistic forecasting, understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to
feature-conditioned outputs remains a significant challenge for forecasters. In
this work, we take a further step toward addressing this critical issue by
introducing the Quantile Neural Basis Model, which incorporates the
interpretability principles of Quantile Generalized Additive Models into an

basis decomposition and weight factorization, complementing Neural Models for
Location, Scale, and Shape by avoiding any parametric distributional
assumptions. We validate our approach on day-ahead electricity price
forecasting, achieving predictive performance comparable to distributional and
quantile regression neural networks, while offering valuable insights into
model behavior through the learned nonlinear mappings from input features to

Abstract: Many incarcerated individuals face significant and complex challenges,
including mental illness, substance dependence, and homelessness, yet jails and
prisons are often poorly equipped to address these needs. With little support
from the existing criminal justice system, these needs can remain untreated and
worsen, often leading to further offenses and a cycle of incarceration with
adverse outcomes both for the individual and for public safety, with
particularly large impacts on communities of color that continue to widen the
already extensive racial disparities in criminal justice outcomes. Responding
to these failures, a growing number of criminal justice stakeholders are
seeking to break this cycle through innovative approaches such as
community-driven and alternative approaches to policing, mentoring, community
building, restorative justice, pretrial diversion, holistic defense, and social
service connections. Here we report on a collaboration between Johnson County,
Kansas, and Carnegie Mellon University to perform targeted, proactive mental
health outreach in an effort to reduce reincarceration rates.
  This paper describes the data used, our predictive modeling approach and
results, as well as the design and analysis of a field trial conducted to
confirm our model's predictive power, evaluate the impact of this targeted
outreach, and understand at what level of reincarceration risk outreach might
be most effective. Through this trial, we find that our model is highly
predictive of new jail bookings, with more than half of individuals in the
trial's highest-risk group returning to jail in the following year. Outreach
was most effective among these highest-risk individuals, with impacts on mental
health utilization, EMS dispatches, and criminal justice involvement.

Abstract: We study a compositional variant of kernel ridge regression in which the
predictor is applied to a coordinate-wise reweighting of the inputs. Formulated
as a variational problem, this model provides a simple testbed for feature
learning in compositional architectures. From the perspective of variable
selection, we show how relevant variables are recovered while noise variables
are eliminated. We establish guarantees showing that both global minimizers and
stationary points discard noise coordinates when the noise variables are
Gaussian distributed. A central finding is that $\ell_1$-type kernels, such as
the Laplace kernel, succeed in recovering features contributing to nonlinear
effects at stationary points, whereas Gaussian kernels recover only linear
ones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合多阶段AI架构、新题数据生成策略和贝叶斯引擎的端到端框架，用于从稀疏常规数据中无侵地估计无法直接测量的眼科变量，以解决青光眼诊断中的逆问题挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决青光眼诊断中的关键挑战：无法在体内测量眼内压的主要决定因素（网状组织适透性），以及缺乏真实数据和计算成本高昂导致的逆问题建模困难。

Method: 采用多阶段人工智能架构功能性分离问题，提出称为PCDS的新题数据生成策略减少计算成本，以及贝叶斯引擎来量化预测不确定性。

Result: 方法能够从单个IOP测量中推断出无法测量的组织适透性和病人排流功能，与现有技术得到优秀一致性，精度可比直接物理仪器，新生物标物在病风险分层中显示高准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决其他数据稀缺、计算密集领域的类似逆问题提供了可普遍化的蓝图。

Abstract: Many critical healthcare decisions are challenged by the inability to measure
key underlying parameters. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness
driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The
primary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork
permeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on
indirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader
computational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse
problems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of
large-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an
end-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from
sparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial
intelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data
generation strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of
thousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from
years to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our
framework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components
from routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue
permeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated
outflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography
with precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the
newly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying
clinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More
broadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving
similar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoSizing是一个端到端框架，通过图算法和LLM代理实现电路理解，并将知识整合到贝叶斯优化中，提高模拟电路设计效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟和混合信号电路设计面临高质量数据短缺和领域知识难以嵌入自动化流程的挑战，传统方法缺乏电路理解能力，学习型方法成本高且需要重新训练

Method: 首先使用图算法将电路组织为层次化设备-模块-阶段表示，然后LLM代理执行假设-验证-精炼循环进行显式标注，最后将验证后的洞察整合到贝叶斯优化中

Result: 该方法通过LLM引导的初始采样和停滞触发的信任区域更新，提高了优化效率并保持了可行性

Conclusion: TopoSizing框架能够直接从原始网表实现稳健的电路理解，并将这些知识转化为优化增益，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal circuit design remains challenging due to the
shortage of high-quality data and the difficulty of embedding domain knowledge
into automated flows. Traditional black-box optimization achieves sampling
efficiency but lacks circuit understanding, which often causes evaluations to
be wasted in low-value regions of the design space. In contrast, learning-based
methods embed structural knowledge but are case-specific and costly to retrain.
Recent attempts with large language models show potential, yet they often rely
on manual intervention, limiting generality and transparency. We propose
TopoSizing, an end-to-end framework that performs robust circuit understanding
directly from raw netlists and translates this knowledge into optimization
gains. Our approach first applies graph algorithms to organize circuits into a
hierarchical device-module-stage representation. LLM agents then execute an
iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement loop with built-in consistency
checks, producing explicit annotations. Verified insights are integrated into
Bayesian optimization through LLM-guided initial sampling and
stagnation-triggered trust-region updates, improving efficiency while
preserving feasibility.

TL;DR: TGPO是一个离线强化学习框架，通过树形轨迹表示和过程奖励模型解决Web Agent训练中的信用分配、标注成本和奖励稀疏性问题，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型的发展，使用大模型作为Web Agent进行自动化网页交互变得重要，但强化学习训练面临信用分配不当、标注成本过高和奖励稀疏等关键挑战。

Method: 提出Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO)框架：1) 树形轨迹表示合并语义相同的状态以消除标签冲突；2) 过程奖励模型通过子目标进度、冗余检测和动作验证自动生成细粒度奖励；3) 动态权重机制在训练中优先处理高影响力决策点。

Result: 在Online-Mind2Web和自建的C-WebShop数据集上的实验表明，TGPO显著优于现有方法，以更少的冗余步骤实现了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: TGPO框架有效解决了Web Agent强化学习训练的关键挑战，通过创新的轨迹表示和奖励机制提升了性能表现。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models and vision-language
models, employing large models as Web Agents has become essential for automated
web interaction. However, training Web Agents with reinforcement learning faces
critical challenges including credit assignment misallocation, prohibitively
high annotation costs, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), an offline reinforcement learning
framework that proposes a tree-structured trajectory representation merging
semantically identical states across trajectories to eliminate label conflicts.
Our framework incorporates a Process Reward Model that automatically generates
fine-grained rewards through subgoal progress, redundancy detection, and action
verification. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes
high-impact decision points during training. Experiments on Online-Mind2Web and
our self-constructed C-WebShop datasets demonstrate that TGPO significantly
outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates with fewer
redundant steps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeAlign是一个轻量级的即插即用框架，通过表示对齐技术解决时间序列预测中输入历史与未来目标之间的分布差异问题，显著提升各种基础预测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比学习等表示学习技术在时间序列预测中表现不佳，但作者认为显式的表示对齐能够提供关键信息来弥合输入历史与未来目标之间的分布差距。

Method: TimeAlign通过简单的重构任务学习辅助特征，并将这些特征反馈给任何基础预测器。该方法架构无关且计算开销极小。

Result: 在八个基准测试上的广泛实验验证了其优越性能，增益主要来自于纠正历史输入与未来输出之间的频率不匹配问题。理论分析表明TimeAlign能增加学习表示与预测目标之间的互信息。

Conclusion: TimeAlign可作为现代深度学习时间序列预测系统的通用对齐模块，具有架构无关性和可忽略的计算开销优势。

Abstract: Representation learning techniques like contrastive learning have long been
explored in time series forecasting, mirroring their success in computer vision
and natural language processing. Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters
seldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little
performance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit
representation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the
distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we
introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns
auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any
base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its
superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily
from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future
outputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of
TimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations
and predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible
overhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep
learning time-series forecasting systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的变分框架，通过对残差进行凸变换来形式化残差基于适应性策略，将适应加权与错误指标的优化直接联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前科学机器学习中残差基于适应策略广泛使用但大多数都是经验性的，缺乏理论基础。需要一种系统化的理论框架来理解和指导这些方法的设计。

Method: 提出了一种统一的变分框架，通过对残差进行凸变换来形式化适应性策略。不同的变换对应不同的目标函数：指数加权对应最小化均匀错误，线性加权对应最小化二次错误。适应加权等价于选择优化原始目标的采样分布。

Result: 该框架带来三个主要好处：(1)支持跨范数的适应方案系统设计，(2)通过减少损失估计器的方差来降低离散化错误，(3)通过改善梯度信噪比来提升学习动力学。在算子学习中展示了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为残差基于适应性提供了理论上的合理性证明，并为有理论基础的离散化和训练策略建立了基础。

Abstract: Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine
learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational
framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations
of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective
functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error,
while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this
perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling
distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking
discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach
yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes
across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of
the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the
gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning,
we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and
architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of
residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled
discretization and training strategies.

*Johnny R. Zhang,Xiaomei Mi,Gaoyuan Du,Qianyi Sun,Shiqi Wang,Jiaxuan Li,Wenhua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的Banach-Bregman框架，将随机优化扩展到非欧几里得空间，在机器学习、深度学习、强化学习和大语言模型训练中实现了更快的收敛速度和更高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机优化理论主要限于Hilbert空间，无法处理非欧几里设置，如镜像下降、Bregman近端方法、自然梯度下降等。需要一种更一般的框架来统一这些方法。

Method: 提出Banach-Bregman框架，通过Bregman投影和Bregman-Fejer单调性提供统一模板，包含随机近似、镜像下降、自然梯度、自适应方法和镜像-prox等方法。还建立了超松弛(λ > 2)和收敛定理。

Result: 在机器学习(UCI数据集)、深度学习(Transformer训练)、强化学习(演员-批评家)和大语言模型(WikiText-2与distilGPT-2)上进行实验，实现了较经典方法进一步20%的收敛速度，降低方差并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Banach-Bregman几何作为优化理论与实践的基石，统一了核心AI范式中的优化方法。

Abstract: Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial
intelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning,
and large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely
confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and
orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as
mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning,
natural gradient descent in information geometry, or
Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based
Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work
introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations,
establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization.
It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer
monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural
gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations
($\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and
elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems
spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and
real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks),
deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning
(actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show
up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over
classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a
cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.

TL;DR: RKTV-INR是一种基于隐式神经表示的去噪框架，通过结合Runge-Kutta积分和全变分约束，从噪声观测中重建非线性动力系统的清洁轨迹和准确导数，用于系统识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性动力系统的数据驱动建模经常受到测量噪声的影响，需要有效的去噪方法来获得清洁的状态轨迹和准确的导数估计，以便准确识别系统动力学方程。

Method: 提出RKTV-INR框架，使用隐式神经表示直接拟合噪声观测数据，同时施加Runge-Kutta积分和全变分约束，确保重建状态符合动力学系统轨迹并保持数据接近性。通过自动微分获得准确导数，再结合SINDy方法识别系统方程。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效抑制噪声，提供精确的导数估计，并实现可靠的系统识别。

Conclusion: RKTV-INR框架成功解决了非线性动力系统建模中的噪声问题，为系统识别提供了有效的去噪和导数估计解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by
measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and
Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that
represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR)
fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total
variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is
a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The
trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate
first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states
and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate
effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system
identification.

*Dmitrii Krasheninnikov,Richard E. Turner,David Krueger*

TL;DR: 语言模型的激活值线性编码了训练过程中信息被学习的时间顺序，模型能够区分不同时间学习的信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否以及如何编码信息的学习时间顺序，这对于理解模型如何处理冲突数据和知识修改具有重要意义

Method: 通过顺序微调Llama-3.2-1B模型在六个不相交但相似的命名实体数据集上，分析激活值的线性编码特性，使用线性探测和微调方法验证时间信号

Result: 发现激活值中心点在2D子空间中按训练顺序排列成直线，线性探测能准确区分早期和晚期实体（90%准确率），微调后模型能报告未见实体的训练阶段（80%准确率）

Conclusion: 模型确实能够通过激活模式编码信息的学习时间，这一发现对模型处理冲突知识和知识更新具有重要意义

Abstract: We show that language models' activations linearly encode when information
was learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known
training order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but
otherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average
activations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training
order: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly
in the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that
linear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish "early" vs. "late" entities,
generalizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can
also be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80%
accuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to
simple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our
paper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by
its acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might
manage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用临界阻尼高阶朗之万动力学来防御扩散模型中的成员推理攻击，通过引入辅助变量和联合扩散过程来保护训练数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI应用的快速发展，数据安全问题日益突出。扩散模型虽然相比其他生成模型对成员推理攻击更具抵抗力，但仍然存在风险。需要开发有效的防御机制来保护训练数据的隐私。

Method: 采用临界阻尼高阶朗之万动力学，引入多个辅助变量并建立沿这些变量的联合扩散过程。辅助变量的存在混合了外部随机性，有助于在扩散过程早期破坏敏感输入数据。

Result: 在玩具数据集和语音数据集上进行了理论分析和实验验证，使用AUROC曲线和FID指标进行评估，证明了该防御方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于高阶朗之万动力学的防御机制能够有效增强扩散模型对成员推理攻击的抵抗力，为生成模型的数据安全保护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have
raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion
models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when
the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model.
Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership
inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The
defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin
dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion
process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary
variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data
earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated
and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the
Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.

TL;DR: NIRVANA是一种新颖的大语言模型结构化剪枝方法，通过神经正切核理论和自适应稀疏分配机制，在保持零样本准确性的同时实现高效剪枝


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化剪枝方法在零样本设置下性能下降严重，需要昂贵的恢复技术如监督微调或适配器插入，需要一种能平衡即时准确性和微调能力的剪枝方法

Method: 基于Adam优化动态下的神经正切核理论推导一阶显著性准则，采用跨层和模块的自适应稀疏分配机制，并使用KL散度进行校准数据选择

Result: 在Llama3、Qwen和T5模型上的综合实验表明，NIRVANA在同等稀疏度约束下优于现有结构化剪枝方法

Conclusion: NIRVANA提供了一种理论上有依据且实用的LLM压缩方法，能够有效平衡零样本准确性保持和微调能力

Abstract: Structured pruning of large language models (LLMs) offers substantial
efficiency improvements by removing entire hidden units, yet current approaches
often suffer from significant performance degradation, particularly in
zero-shot settings, and necessitate costly recovery techniques such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or adapter insertion. To address these critical
shortcomings, we introduce NIRVANA, a novel pruning method explicitly designed
to balance immediate zero-shot accuracy preservation with robust fine-tuning
capability. Leveraging a first-order saliency criterion derived from the Neural
Tangent Kernel under Adam optimization dynamics, NIRVANA provides a
theoretically grounded pruning strategy that respects essential model training
behaviors. To further address the unique challenges posed by structured
pruning, NIRVANA incorporates an adaptive sparsity allocation mechanism across
layers and modules (attention vs. MLP), which adjusts pruning intensity between
modules in a globally balanced manner. Additionally, to mitigate the high
sensitivity of pruning decisions to calibration data quality, we propose a
simple yet effective KL divergence-based calibration data selection strategy,
ensuring more reliable and task-agnostic pruning outcomes. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on Llama3, Qwen, and T5 models demonstrate that NIRVANA
outperforms existing structured pruning methods under equivalent sparsity
constraints, providing a theoretically sound and practical approach to LLM
compression. The code is available at

TL;DR: Compute as Teacher (CaT) 通过将推理时的探索转化为无参考监督，使用模型自身的并行rollouts合成参考信号来优化模型性能，在可验证和不可验证任务上均取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决后训练阶段缺乏真实监督信号的问题，探索如何将推理时的计算资源转化为有效的学习信号

Method: 通过当前策略生成一组并行rollouts，使用冻结的初始策略（anchor）来调和冲突和遗漏，合成单一参考信号，并将其转化为奖励信号。在可验证任务中使用程序等价性，在不可验证任务中使用自提议的评分标准并由独立LLM评判

Result: 在Gemma 3 4B、Qwen 3 4B和Llama 3.1 8B模型上显著提升性能（MATH-500最高+27%，HealthBench最高+12%），结合强化学习后进一步提升（最高+33%和+30%）

Conclusion: CaT能够有效利用推理时计算作为监督信号，性能随rollouts数量扩展，训练后的策略甚至能超越初始教师信号，为无监督学习提供了新思路

Abstract: Where do learning signals come from when there is no ground truth in
post-training? We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute
as Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time
into reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group
of parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current
policy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy)
reconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra
inference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two
regimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers;
(ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria
scored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction
satisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge
scores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all
rollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a
test-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up
to +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning
(CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained
policy surpassing the initial teacher signal.
