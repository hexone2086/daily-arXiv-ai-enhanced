### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，通过扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，结合LiDAR支持，解决了多传感器模拟中的跨传感器不一致性问题，渲染速度比现有方法快1.5-20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法存在渲染速度慢、仅支持针孔相机模型的问题，且多传感器模拟中存在跨传感器不一致性，限制了在自动驾驶等应用中的实用性。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计了因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略来减少跨传感器不一致性。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差平均减少达40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上的评估显示其保真度达到或超过现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了多传感器模拟中的关键挑战，在保真度和渲染速度方面均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgFUTR：一种通过状态变化学习重构手术未来预测的方法，使用师生架构和动作动态模块，在多个数据集和手术程序上实现一致的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件，而非预测未来事件。现有方法针对孤立任务，缺乏统一的方法来同时处理短期和长期预测，且基于未来特征预测的方法难以在不同手术情境和程序间泛化。

Method: 将手术未来预测重构为状态变化学习，通过师生架构实现：教师网络从当前和未来视频片段学习，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，使用Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类压缩视频为状态表示，并通过动作动态模块指导。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术程序上的实验显示一致的性能提升。跨程序迁移验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过状态变化学习的方法能够有效解决手术未来预测问题，在多个任务和数据集上表现出优越性能，并具有良好的跨程序泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架解决植物病害诊断模型在目标域泛化能力差的问题，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，仅用少量目标域样本即可显著提升模型在部署环境中的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境和部署环境存在差异时性能显著下降，主要原因是疾病症状的细微变化和领域差距，以及训练数据多样性不足。

Method: 提出TMPS框架，基于度量学习，利用少量目标域标记样本进行目标感知训练，采用优先采样策略有效利用目标域信息。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型和传统度量学习分别提升平均宏F1分数18.7和17.1个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS框架能有效提升植物病害诊断模型在目标域的泛化能力，仅需少量目标域样本即可显著改善模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个零标签视觉语言对齐框架，通过主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，使现有视觉语言模型无需文本标签或完全重新训练即可生成改进的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集的问题，充分利用未标注图像数据，实现零标签学习。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐框架ViZer，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需文本标签或完全重新训练。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer，观察到一致的定性改进，生成的描述更加基础和详细。

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言任务中的零标签适应提供了实用起点，克服了传统自动评估指标对细节的惩罚问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

### [5] [Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953)
*Xiao He,Huangxuan Zhao,Guojia Wan,Wei Zhou,Yanxing Liu,Juhua Liu,Yongchao Xu,Yong Luo,Dacheng Tao,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医疗AI系统，通过引入显著认知解耦(SED)方法，解决了胎儿超声中多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性的挑战，在报告生成和诊断任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，因为胎儿超声面临多视图图像推理、众多疾病和图像多样性的挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的双分图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床忠实步骤的选择偏好。同时构建了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集FetalSigma-1M。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均增益+14%，在关键疾病上的准确率提高了61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流程指导的SED方法和大规模数据集，有效解决了胎儿超声领域的特定挑战，在报告生成和诊断任务上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级指导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦指导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，提升图像清晰度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在采样过程中细节增强不足、伪影控制不佳的问题，提供无需重新训练即可提升图像质量的方法。

Method: 使用ZeResFDG模块结合频率解耦指导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，配合轻量级频谱EMA进行模式切换，并采用QSilk微粒度稳定器进行推理时稳定化处理。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器中显著改善图像清晰度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制，在中等指导尺度下无需重新训练即可获得更好的图像质量。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种有效的采样器级指导方法，能够显著提升扩散模型的图像生成质量，特别是在细节增强和伪影控制方面表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE提出了一种混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，在减少计算成本的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器的朴素堆叠会导致收益递减和推理成本倍增，需要更智能的编码器选择方法。

Method: 采用混合编码器框架，包含共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力来选择最优编码器，使用双熵正则化和辅助损失训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器加1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型优于同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时减少24-49%的计算量。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合，挑战了多编码器视觉语言模型的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言动作描述的所有参考对象。构建了SVAG-Bench基准数据集和SVAGFormer基线框架，实验显示现有模型在密集或复杂场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用对象跟踪，忽视了联合检测和跟踪多个对象并根据其动作进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 引入SVAG任务，构建SVAG-Bench基准数据集(688个视频，19,590个标注记录，903个独特动词)，提出SVAGFormer基线框架，开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中，突显了在长视频中进行细粒度对象-动作交互推理的需求。

Conclusion: SVAG任务提出了新的挑战，需要更先进的推理能力来处理视频中的细粒度对象-动作交互，特别是在长视频和复杂场景中。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包含320个提示和2560个标注视频，并设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成需要逻辑进展的多事件连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，而现有基准主要关注视觉质量，缺乏对长序列叙事连贯性的评估。

Method: 构建包含320个提示的SeqBench数据集，涵盖不同叙事复杂度；设计基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，能够高效捕捉长距离依赖和时序关系。

Result: DTG指标与人工标注有强相关性；系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限：多动作序列中对象状态不一致、多对象场景物理不合理、时序关系保持困难。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成）将场景感知注入文本条件运动模型，利用不相交的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集，无需构建大规模同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么关注运动语义，要么关注场景感知，但无法同时处理两者，因为构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务来桥接两个不同的数据集，通过两个阶段：1）引入关键帧层来调制运动潜在空间进行中间帧生成；2）添加场景条件层，通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知注入文本到运动模型中，并进一步分析了这种感知出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，通过创新的两阶段适应方法，在不依赖大规模综合数据集的情况下实现了场景感知的文本到运动生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法来提高心电图异常检测的准确性。

Method: 使用一维卷积神经网络进行特征提取，结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型进行序列建模，基于Vision Mamba的双向变体增强时间依赖性表示。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2020和2021挑战赛数据集上，该模型在12导联心电图上获得了显著更高的AUPRC和AUROC分数，优于之前发表的最佳算法。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的架构在可靠的心电图分类方面具有巨大潜力，支持早期诊断和个性化治疗，同时提高远程医疗和资源受限医疗系统的可及性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [12] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是首个无需几何先验的自监督新视角合成模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了真正的姿态可转移性，无需3D归纳偏置或显式SE(3)参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新视角合成模型的预测姿态缺乏可转移性，同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的新视角合成。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，共同实现相机姿态与场景内容的解耦，促进几何推理，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态新视角合成变换器，潜在姿态与真实世界姿态高度相关，实现了真正的姿态可转移性。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需3D归纳偏置或显式姿态参数化也能实现真正的新视角合成，为自监督学习提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，用于红外和可见光图像融合，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号，提高边缘清晰度和纹理保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习方法在训练时使用梯度幅值损失，但这种方法移除了方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不佳。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在不同尺度上保留其符号，提供清晰的方向指导。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上的实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够产生更清晰、对齐更好的边缘和更丰富的纹理保留。

Conclusion: 提出的方向感知多尺度梯度损失在不改变模型架构或训练协议的情况下，显著提升了红外和可见光图像融合的质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于医学图像分割的无监督域自适应框架，通过结合风格标准化和双向可变形图像配准来解决跨域海马体分割中的域偏移问题，在从健康人群到痴呆患者的迁移中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时，由于图像外观（风格）和解剖特征（内容）的域偏移而表现不佳，特别是在海马体分割中，不同人群的解剖差异导致模型泛化能力下降。

Method: 结合z-标准化的风格协调和双向可变形图像配准策略，将配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换来对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的评估显示，该方法优于现有基线。从健康人群迁移到痴呆患者时，Dice得分相对标准增强方法提升高达15%，在内容偏移较大的场景中效果最显著。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理跨域海马体分割中的域偏移问题，特别是在处理不同人群的解剖差异方面表现出色，为多样人群的准确海马体分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种量化扩散概率模型中计数幻觉的方法，构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件，并开发了标准化评估协议来系统分析采样条件对计数幻觉的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，但缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法，阻碍了在事实约束下设计下一代生成模型的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集套件，开发标准化评估协议，系统分析不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉的影响。

Result: 研究发现广泛使用的FID图像质量指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作为系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉现象迈出了第一步，为图像生成中幻觉现象的研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销大、内存消耗高的问题，并且往往牺牲视觉保真度，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 引入时空特征内存库(SFM)缓存特征，提出特征最相似传播(FMP)方法保持时间一致性，使用SFM更新算法持续刷新缓存特征，并利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码。

Result: 实验表明Edit-Your-Interest在效率和视觉保真度方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量编辑效果的同时显著降低了计算成本，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手缺乏社交意识的问题，通过多模态上下文建模来准确判断干预时机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs缺乏从自我中心视角理解人类社交动态的能力，导致在社交互动中不断发出不恰当的干预，破坏自然对话和用户专注度。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的大规模数据集EgoSocial，并提出EgoSoD方法，通过整合多模态上下文线索（音频和视觉）到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: 实验显示当前OLLMs在检测干预时机方面表现较差（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%），而EgoSoD方法显著提升了性能：在干预时机检测上，Phi-4提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；在整体社交互动性能上，分别提升20.4%和6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法通过多模态社交动态建模，能够主动检测干预时机和社交互动，为AR/VR环境中的AI助手提供了更好的社交意识。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Method: 使用变分原理(VP)生成具有指定雅可比行列度和旋度的非折叠网格，在微分同胚群中生成逆变换而非图像空间操作。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，VPreg在35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数、变换规律性以及逆映射的准确性和一致性方面均优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg在配准精度、变换质量和逆映射准确性方面均优于现有方法，为计算解剖学和形态计量学提供了更可靠的微分同胚空间变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Motivation: 解决文本-图像跨模态检索中的信息熵不平衡问题，传统方法在两种模态的相互检索中存在不平衡，需要填补文本相对于图像的信息熵差距。

Conclusion: OS-HGAdapter方法通过利用LLM的开放语义知识和超图适配器，有效解决了跨模态检索中的信息熵不平衡问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that

Conclusion: 提出的DP-TTA方法通过利用TEM信号的内在物理特性作为先验知识，有效解决了模型在不同地理环境下的适应性问题，显著提升了去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the

2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing

about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

### [27] [MimicParts: Part-aware Style Injection for Speech-Driven 3D Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13208)
*Lianlian Liu,YongKang He,Zhaojie Chu,Xiaofen Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过分区风格注入和分区去噪网络来生成基于语音的3D人体风格化运动，解决了现有方法忽略区域运动风格差异和动态适应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在生成语音驱动的3D人体运动时存在两个主要问题：一是风格编码过于简化或忽略区域差异（如上身vs下身），二是未能动态适应语音节奏和情感变化，限制了运动真实感。

Method: MimicParts框架采用分区风格注入和分区去噪网络，将身体分为不同区域来编码局部运动风格，并通过分区注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在自然度和表现力方面优于现有方法，能够生成更真实的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts通过分区风格编码和动态适应机制，有效提升了语音驱动3D人体风格化运动的生成质量，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

TL;DR: 本文对视觉提示(VP)和视觉提示调优(VPT)进行了系统综述，提出了统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，并建立了分类体系来区分这两种技术及其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏对这两种技术及其各自应用的系统区分。

Method: 从第一性原理重新审视VP和VPT设计，提出统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，建立分类体系将现有方法分为可学习、生成和不可学习提示，并按注入粒度组织。

Result: 建立了PA在医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等领域的应用框架，总结了当前基准并识别了关键挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面综述，旨在为研究人员和从业者提供清晰的路线图来理解和探索PA相关研究的发展格局。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

*Hang-Cheng Dong,Yibo Jiao,Fupeng Wei,Guodong Liu,Dong Ye,Bingguo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向工业表面缺陷检测的样本中心多任务学习框架，解决了传统像素中心方法在样本级决策稳定性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业缺陷检测面临前景-背景极度不平衡、缺陷稀疏且尺度分布长尾、对比度低等挑战，导致传统像素中心方法难以关注小缺陷或低对比度缺陷，样本级决策稳定性不足。

Method: 采用共享编码器架构，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，通过样本级监督调制特征分布并持续提升小缺陷召回率，分割分支保留边界细节以增强决策稳定性。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 样本中心多任务学习框架能有效解决工业缺陷检测中样本级决策稳定性问题，提出的Seg_mIoU和Seg_Recall评估指标能更准确地反映实际质量控制需求。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块来解决视觉语言模型在否定理解上的肯定偏见问题，显著提升了描述性目标检测任务中的否定理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定时存在严重的肯定偏见，这尤其在描述性目标检测任务中造成关键失败。

Method: 开发了CoVAND数据集生成管道和NegToMe文本token合并模块，该模块通过将否定词与属性词绑定成语义短语来解决tokenization中的否定线索丢失问题，并结合LoRA微调方法。

Result: 方法在挑战性否定基准测试中显著提升性能，在OVDEval上将NMS-AP提高了+10.8分，降低了误报率，并能泛化到最先进的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决真实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，能够在一个模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、折线、线段），通过实例-几何交互机制实现跨级别上下文交换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常只针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构分别训练模型，限制了处理复杂结构的能力。

Method: 将矢量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块迭代更新，并引入动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector证明了通过实例-几何交互可以统一处理多种矢量类型，为矢量提取提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

TL;DR: EPIPTrack是一个统一的多模态视觉语言跟踪框架，通过显式和隐式提示实现动态目标建模和语义对齐，在多个数据集上优于现有跟踪器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要更灵活的动态目标建模方法。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转化为自然语言描述，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整，并设计判别性特征增强器。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack展现出强大的适应性和优越性能，验证了动态多模态提示在目标跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)及相应的防御策略，通过破坏视觉与文本表示的语义对齐来干扰机器人任务执行，并采用对抗性微调来增强模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习中取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究VLA模型的对抗脆弱性并提出相应防御方案。

Method: 提出EDPA攻击方法：1)破坏视觉与文本潜在表示的语义对齐；2)最大化对抗样本与干净样本潜在表示的差异。防御策略：对视觉编码器进行对抗性微调，使其对干净和对抗样本产生相似的潜在表示。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准测试中，EDPA显著提高了前沿VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御策略有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: VLA模型存在对抗脆弱性，EDPA攻击能有效干扰机器人任务执行，而对抗性微调是有效的防御手段，为提升VLA模型安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: SketchSem3D基准数据集和CymbaDiff方法为室外3D语义场景生成提供了标准化评估框架，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种超实时人群计数模型，采用stem-encoder-decoder结构，在嵌入式系统上实现最快推理速度，同时保持竞争力精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人群计数方法在嵌入式系统应用中存在模型参数过多、计算复杂等问题，无法满足实时性要求。

Method: 使用stem-encoder-decoder结构：stem网络采用大卷积核扩大感受野；编码器使用条件通道加权和多分支局部融合块低计算量融合多尺度特征；顶部添加特征金字塔网络解决不完全融合问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试上验证，模型在NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti上达到381.7 FPS，在NVIDIA Jetson TX1上达到71.9 FPS，推理速度最快。

Conclusion: 该网络适用于嵌入式系统上的超实时人群计数，在保证竞争力的准确度同时实现了最快的推理速度。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答方面取得进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍不明确。本研究旨在揭示VideoLLMs的内部信息流模式。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，特别关注不同层中视频和文本信息的交互模式。

Result: 发现了四个一致模式：(1)早期到中间层进行跨帧交互；(2)中间层实现视频-语言集成；(3)中后期层生成正确答案；(4)通过选择有效信息路径，模型可以在减少58%注意力边的情况下保持性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了VideoLLMs执行时序推理的机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

Motivation: VPR系统在变化的环境条件下面临挑战，关键应用需要鲁棒的不确定性估计，但现有方法通常需要额外训练或验证数据。

Method: 提出三种训练免费的不确定性度量：相似性分布(SD)量化候选者间的分数分离度，比率扩展(RS)评估顶级评分位置的竞争模糊性，统计不确定性(SU)结合SD和RS提供统一度量。

Result: 在9种先进VPR方法和6个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，这些度量能有效区分正确和错误匹配，优于现有方法且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 所提出的训练免费不确定性度量方法在保持实时性能的同时，显著提升了VPR系统的精度-召回性能，适用于各种环境条件。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用分离的编码器和解码器处理不同模态，阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理等任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal

*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次对硬件加速的特征检测器在视觉SLAM管道中进行比较研究，对比了GPU和FPGA在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal SoC上的性能表现。研究发现传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更好，而学习型检测器（SuperPoint）在FPGA上具有更好的运行时性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中耗时且耗能的模块，而当前在功耗受限平台（如无人机）上部署SLAM的需求日益增长。GPU和集成FPGA的SoC都是常见的硬件加速方案，但缺乏系统性的比较研究。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal SoC上，分别实现并比较了GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器，以及它们在视觉SLAM管道中的整体性能。

Result: 对于传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris），GPU实现比FPGA实现具有更好的运行时性能和能效；而对于学习型检测器SuperPoint，FPGA实现比GPU实现具有更好的运行时性能（最高3.1倍提升）和能效（最高1.4倍提升）。GPU加速的V-SLAM在精度上普遍优于FPGA加速版本。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可以显著提升V-SLAM性能，传统检测器更适合GPU加速，而学习型检测器在FPGA上表现更优。硬件加速还能通过减少全局束调整调用频率来进一步提升SLAM管道性能，且不牺牲精度。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

*Keyan Zhou,Zecheng Tang,Lingfeng Ming,Guanghao Zhou,Qiguang Chen,Dan Qiao,Zheming Yang,Libo Qin,Minghui Qiu,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MMLongCite基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中的忠实度，发现现有模型在处理长多模态上下文时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩大，但扩展的上下文窗口并不能保证有效利用上下文，这对实际应用构成关键挑战。当前评估主要关注纯文本领域，多模态评估仅限于短上下文。

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准，包含8个不同任务，涵盖6个上下文长度区间，整合了文本、图像和视频等多种模态。

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型的评估显示，它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实度有限。深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实度的影响。

Conclusion: MMLongCite基准填补了多模态长上下文评估的空白，揭示了大型视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

### [42] [Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282)
*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过退化类型分类和图像重建的双重任务，为图像修复任务提供通用表示，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像修复任务上表现有限，需要一种能够处理多种退化类型和级别的通用预训练方法

Method: 使用掩码退化分类预训练，包含编码器和两个解码器：分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重建高质量图像

Result: 在5D全功能修复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型有强泛化能力

Conclusion: MaskDCPT为图像修复提供了有效的预训练方案，同时发布了包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at
https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动文档分类系统，能够检测图像中的文本内容并将文档分类为发票、报告、信件和表格四类，支持离线图像和实时摄像头捕获，在各种挑战性条件下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中文档分类面临的挑战，包括可变光照、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率和远距离文本等问题。

Method: 采用四阶段流水线：图像采集与预处理、使用DBNet++进行文本检测、使用BART分类器进行文本分类，所有功能通过PyQt5实现的用户界面集成。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上经过10小时测试，文本检测准确率达到92.88%，能够有效处理高分辨率图像中的各种困难挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法在无约束成像场景下对混合来源的文档分类具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

### [44] [Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation via Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13307)
*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于点云分割的新类发现方法(3D-NCD)，通过引入结构因果模型(SCM)来学习基类和新类之间的因果关系，实现仅使用基类监督就能分割未标记新类的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云新类发现方法通常采用粗略或统计相关性学习，容易在新类推理中产生混淆。通过引入因果约束，可以揭示与类别准确对应的本质点云表示。

Method: 提出联合学习因果表示和推理的方法：首先通过SCM分析基类表示中的隐藏混杂因素和基类与新类之间的因果关系；设计因果表示原型来消除混杂因素；使用图结构建模基类因果表示原型与新类原型之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果表明该方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 通过结构因果模型和因果推理，该方法能够有效解决点云新类发现问题，准确分割未标记的新类。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM方法，在保持重建精度的同时实现了40倍加速，解决了传统方法计算开销大和深度学习方法内存消耗高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP）在CPU上运行Bundle Adjustment和全局定位时计算开销大，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM）在处理大规模场景时GPU内存消耗急剧增加，无法扩展到数千张输入图像。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM管线的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的Bundle Adjustment优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的加速，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度，能够处理5000张图像的大规模场景。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，在大规模SfM任务中实现了显著的性能提升，解决了传统方法和深度学习方法在速度和内存方面的限制。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提高了事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用视觉增强，忽视了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个令牌候选大小，充分利用logit分布信息。

Result: 在四个LVLM和七个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提出的解码方法相比最先进的解码方法显著增强了事实一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询相关增强和熵感知解码对于改进LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中人们的注意力和兴趣受到所见所闻的深刻影响，理解视觉趣味性对吸引和保持注意力至关重要。随着大型多模态模型的发展，研究者希望探索这些模型是否能够捕捉视觉趣味性的概念。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o预测的一致性，利用GPT-4o对图像对的趣味性进行标注，然后将这些标注数据用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分一致性，GPT-4o在捕捉视觉趣味性概念方面表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: 这项研究为深入理解人类兴趣铺平了道路，展示了大型多模态模型在视觉趣味性分析方面的潜力，并为相关应用提供了有效的数据标注和模型训练方法。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的代价体积，从而显著提高推理速度并减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经验观察到代价体积在RAFT等网络的其他部分充分训练后会失去重要性，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除代价体积，创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，比同类模型快1.2倍且内存占用降低6倍；最快模型能在500MB GPU内存下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 通过移除代价体积的训练策略，可以在保持精度的同时显著提升光流估计的速度和内存效率。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Motivation: 现有隐蔽武器检测技术存在分辨率低、隐私问题等限制，需要开发实时、低成本且保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 基于YOLOv8架构改进，在SPPF层使用可变形卷积提取多尺度特征，在骨干网络和颈部网络提取低、中、高层特征，并引入焦点损失解决类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 该工作为热成像隐蔽武器检测建立了新的基准，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE存在码本塌陷问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，但限制了码本学习能力，导致重建质量下降。

Method: Group-VQ进行分组优化码本，每组独立优化，组内联合优化；同时提出训练后码本重采样方法。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现更好，训练后码本采样方法实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渲染视频与相机拍摄视频存在显著差异，现有无参考视频质量评估方法主要针对相机视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影

Method: 创建了一个大型渲染视频数据集，包含多种3D场景和渲染设置，并设计了专门针对渲染视频的无参考质量评估指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性

Result: 提出的指标在渲染视频上表现出优越性能，能够有效评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略

Conclusion: 开发了专门针对渲染视频的质量评估解决方案，填补了现有方法在渲染视频评估方面的空白，为计算机图形应用提供了更准确的视频质量评估工具

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

Motivation: 探究提示设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）的影响，特别是在数据稀缺条件下。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代VLM，采用三层次提示设计系统增加语言细节。

Result: 性能最佳模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单提示时效果最好，详细提示反而显著降低性能（准确率从68.8%降至55.1%）。SigLip模型在模糊类别上使用详细提示有所改善。

Conclusion: 提示设计对VLM性能有重要影响，简单提示通常优于详细提示，存在模型特定的'提示过拟合'现象。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5%进展（vs. 65.0%），在LIBERO模拟器中达到94.9%（vs. 93.6%），在Simpler模拟器中达到74.8%（vs. 58.8%），均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式集成空间感知能力，有效提升了VLA模型的空间推理性能，在多种环境中都表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.
Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的新方法，用于动态城市场景的渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据或3D运动标注即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的动态城市场景方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、3D分割真值以及运动数据，限制了应用范围。本文旨在通过结合2D先验和SDF表示来放宽这些要求。

Method: 将符号距离函数(SDF)与3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)相结合，利用2D深度和点跟踪先验，构建统一的优化框架来增强几何精度和变形建模。

Result: 在城市场景上无需LiDAR数据即可达到最先进的渲染指标；结合LiDAR时能进一步改进重建和生成新视图的能力，支持场景分解和合成等编辑任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过SDF和3DGS的有效结合，实现了对动态城市场景的鲁棒表示和高质量渲染，显著降低了对额外数据的需求。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和鲁棒双蒸馏策略，在Widar3.0基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有WiFi手势识别方法在泛化性和语义表达能力方面的局限性，特别是CSI的领域敏感性和缺乏高级手势抽象的问题。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式；使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时间嵌入并通过跨模态注意机制对齐语义；引入语义感知软监督方案编码类间相关性；开发鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务中均优于现有最先进方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实世界AIoT应用中的广义RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力方面不足，特别是缺乏对人类空间认知中重要的内在动态空间推理的评估。

Method: 基于认知分类法构建统一基准，开发可扩展的自动化流程生成多样化的空间推理问题，创建包含评估集和训练集的数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进视觉语言模型的评估显示，当前模型在空间推理能力上与人类存在较大且一致的差距，特别是在多步骤多视角空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了Mask-GRPO方法，首次将基于GRPO的强化学习应用于被忽视的掩码生成模型范式，在文本到图像生成任务中取得了显著改进。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，而忽略了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，采用去除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等策略。

Result: 显著提升了基础模型Show-o在标准文本到图像基准测试和偏好对齐方面的性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将强化学习引入掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的优化方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够在4K+分辨率下保持内容一致性和提示对齐，解决了现有方法在分辨率提升时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法局限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战变得更加困难。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的一致性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器通过补丁级注意力机制实现全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，解决了大规模修复中的常见伪影问题，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDS是一种用于异构场景下协作感知的方法，通过域分离解决特征差异问题，采用轻量级空间通道调整器和分布对齐模块，在保持高推理效率的同时提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同的编码器，这在现实异构部署中不成立。现有方法将邻居特征对齐到自车特征，容易受到域差距噪声影响，且基于transformer的域适应模块在移动设备上推理效率低。

Method: 提出CoDS方法，包含两个特征对齐模块：轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)和通过域分离的分布对齐(DADS)。LSCR使用轻量卷积层在空间和通道维度对齐特征，DADS通过编码器特定和编码器无关的域分离模块消除域依赖信息并捕获任务相关信息。使用域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失最大化异构特征间的互信息。

Result: 大量实验表明，CoDS能有效缓解异构场景中的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过域分离方法成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，采用全卷积架构确保了高推理效率，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离神经元对物理场景属性的选择性。需要开发能够直接研究神经元对3D场景属性选择性的方法。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，参数化网格变形使用径向基函数，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规律性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探测神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学连接起来，提供了一种超越传统基于像素方法的、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像技术在食品质量分析中的潜力，特别是比较深度学习方法和传统方法在食品质量参数建模中的表现。

Method: 通过四项研究，比较基于卷积神经网络（CNN）和偏最小二乘法（PLS）的模型，包括2D CNN增强光谱卷积层的方法。

Result: CNN在联合空间-光谱分析中优于PLS，特别是在化学和物理视觉信息相关的参数建模中。PLS在分析化学参数平均含量时表现良好。CNN方法能生成更平滑的化学分布图。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像结合CNN方法在食品质量分析中具有优势，但PLS在特定场景下仍然有效。同时开发了两个开源Python包来加速PLS建模和交叉验证。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功地将文本到视频生成和3D重建能力结合，为文本到3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Conclusion: 该模型具有高度适应性，可用于开发实际场景中的端到端情绪识别系统，代码和结果已公开。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Conclusion: UniME-V2通过MLLM增强的表示学习和硬负样本挖掘策略，有效提升了多模态嵌入模型的判别能力和性能。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

*Maximilian Weiherer,Antonia von Riedheim,Vanessa Brébant,Bernhard Egger,Christoph Palm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经参数化3D乳房形状模型和基于该模型的低成本3D表面重建流程，能够从单目RGB视频中恢复准确的乳房几何形状，精度在2毫米以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有商业3D乳房扫描方案昂贵且需要专用硬件的问题，提供一种仅需普通RGB视频的低成本、可访问的替代方案。

Method: 结合最先进的运动恢复结构流程和参数化乳房模型，使用局部神经符号距离函数分解乳房区域，每个区域由解剖标志点锚定的局部神经SDF表示。

Result: 提出的liRBSM模型在重建质量上显著优于全局iRBSM，能够恢复更详细的表面细节，重建误差小于2毫米，处理时间少于6分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种快速、透明、开源的3D乳房重建解决方案，无需专用硬件，仅需普通RGB视频即可获得高质量结果。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

TL;DR: 该研究通过基于代理的流式基准测试，揭示了跨文化组成和渐进模糊如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性，发现不同文化群体在模糊条件下的性能退化模式存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要面对文化差异和视觉条件退化。研究旨在探索文化组成和感知退化如何共同影响面部识别鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于代理的流式基准测试，在冻结的CLIP特征空间中训练轻量级残差适配器。代理在5x5网格上移动交互，环境提供按sigma调度的Gaussian模糊输入。研究比较了单一文化群体和混合群体的表现。

Result: JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊度下性能更高但中间阶段下降更快，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化，但不平衡设置会放大多数群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，量化了这些因素对系统性能的影响。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth在保持精度的同时显著减少参数，通过知识蒸馏策略有效提升了模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法仅依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照等挑战条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音视频数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec2提取音频时序特征，MobileViT提取视觉局部和全局特征，早期融合机制结合多模态，多阶段时序卷积网络学习长程时序依赖关系。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8%。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net框架具有高效性、有效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集可作为多模态异常识别研究的基准数据集。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Method: 采用PRISMA方法的系统文献综述，分析了39项同行评审研究，调查医学图像增强的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标。

Result: 识别出低对比度和噪声是最频繁的问题；MRI和多模态成像受到最多关注；29项研究使用传统数学方法，9项使用深度学习技术，1项使用混合方法；共引入65个图像质量评估指标，主要是无参考指标。

Conclusion: 该综述突出了当前医学图像增强的局限性、研究空白和未来潜在发展方向，强调了评估指标在评估增强方法影响中的重要性。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器在对抗攻击下的脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击检测和不确定性估计的基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然DINOv2等基础模型在少样本异常检测中表现良好，但其对抗攻击鲁棒性和不确定性校准能力尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其在安全关键应用中的可信度。

Method: 基于AnomalyDINO，在冻结的DINOv2特征上附加轻量级线性头来生成对抗扰动，使用FGSM攻击评估鲁棒性，并应用Platt缩放进行后验校准以改进不确定性估计。

Result: 对抗攻击导致F1、AUROC、AP和G-mean指标显著下降，表明微小扰动可改变特征空间中的最近邻关系；校准后的后验分布对对抗样本产生更高的预测熵，有效降低校准误差。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和原则性不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信部署的必备能力，研究揭示了DINOv2基检测器的具体漏洞并建立了评估协议和基准。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的超分辨率方法在处理多样化和严重退化图像时，容易出现噪声放大或错误内容生成的问题，需要改进以保持局部和全局像素关系。

Method: 使用局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制，结合分布和感知对齐的像素空间条件机制，从局部细节到全局结构逐步保留和细化信息。

Result: 在多个超分辨率基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法能生成高保真、感知准确的图像重建结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解伪影问题，确保真实细节恢复，生成与原始内容结构一致的高质量图像。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑流程提供了一个可扩展且通用的范例。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法难以泛化到不同数据域，主要由于标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化无标注面部图像集，采用伪标签策略和奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和多模态大语言模型的语义线索计算置信度分数。

Conclusion: OmniGaze是一个有效的半监督框架，能够利用无标注数据提升3D视线估计的泛化性能，同时作为可扩展的数据引擎具有实用价值。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Motivation: 现有视频掩码自回归模型存在两个主要问题：慢启动问题（早期采样阶段缺乏结构化全局先验）以及在空间和时间维度上的误差累积。

Method: 引入画布机制（模糊的下一帧全局预测）作为掩码生成的起点；提出组合式分类器自由引导，联合放大空间（画布）和时间条件；使用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR用更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上表现优异，可与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的慢启动和误差累积问题，实现了更高效和高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出了KnowCoL框架，通过结合图像、文本描述和Wikidata结构化知识，在共享语义空间中实现开放域视觉实体识别，显著提升了罕见和未见实体的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、训练时未见实体、长尾分布等挑战，需要解决有限监督、视觉模糊性和语义消歧等问题。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次和关系上下文来支持零样本实体识别。

Result: 在OVEN基准测试中，最小模型相比最先进方法在未见实体上的准确率提升了10.5%，且模型尺寸小35倍。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是对罕见和未见实体。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

*Xinyang Li,Tengfei Wang,Zixiao Gu,Shengchuan Zhang,Chunchao Guo,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个从单张图像或文本提示快速生成3D场景的生成模型，速度比之前工作快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，存在速度慢的问题。3D导向方法直接生成3D表示但视觉质量较差。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持MV导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型，然后通过跨模式蒸馏将3D导向模式的质量提升到MV导向水平。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持3D一致性的同时显著提升视觉质量，并减少推理所需的去噪步骤，实现高效高质量的3D场景生成。

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过创新的双模式训练框架，成功结合了MV导向的高质量和3D导向的高效性，在3D场景生成领域实现了突破。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Marina Crespo Aguirre,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）的新方法，用于从病理图像生成健康的反事实图像，在保留个体解剖特征的同时选择性去除病理区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中生成健康的反事实图像对于异常检测和健康扫描分析工具的应用具有重要意义，但现有方法难以平衡异常去除与个体特征保留。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始点，还以合成的病理图像为最终点来约束扩散过程，将病理图像作为结构信息先验。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务上优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM方法能够生成更准确匹配患者解剖结构的健康反事实图像，有效平衡病理去除与个体特征保留。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

*Jonghyun Park,Minhyuk Seo,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为风险自适应激活转向（RAS）的方法，通过重新构建查询来增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，在查询级别进行准确风险评估，并自适应地引导激活以生成安全且有用的响应，无需迭代输出调整的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型在确保对良性查询提供有用响应同时拒绝恶意查询方面面临挑战，特别是在处理嵌入有害意图的多模态查询时。现有的安全对齐方法要么需要昂贵的训练成本，要么在推理时会产生过度拒绝和速度下降的问题。

Method: 重新构建查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，在查询级别进行风险评估，然后根据评估的风险自适应地引导模型激活，生成安全且有用的响应。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度，优于先前的推理时防御方法。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效地解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保持模型效用的同时提高了安全性，并且避免了推理速度的下降。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MVCustom框架，解决多视角生成与个性化定制的统一问题，通过特征场表示和深度感知特征渲染等技术实现几何一致性和视角控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时实现多视角相机姿态控制和个性化定制，多视角生成模型缺乏几何一致性，而定制模型缺乏显式视角控制。

Method: 基于扩散模型，使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何，结合密集时空注意力增强的文本到视频扩散主干，在推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全。

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和定制的框架，在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: MVCustom成功解决了多视角定制任务，实现了多视角一致性和定制保真度的统一。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的方法，用于从脑部血管图像中提取Willis环的中心线图和形态特征，并在TopCoW数据集上验证了其高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部重要的动脉网络，传统骨架化技术难以可靠提取其中心线，且公开的中心线数据集稀缺，需要开发更准确的方法。

Method: 结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接算法，从200名卒中患者的MRA和CTA图像中提取中心线图和形态特征。

Result: 算法在测试集上实现了高精度的图拓扑重建（F1=1），节点平均欧氏距离小于1个体素，特征提取的鲁棒性强（中位相对误差<5%，皮尔逊相关系数>0.95）。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接方法能有效提取解剖学上合理的中心线，强调了超越简单体素测量的重要性，并发布了数据集和基线算法以支持后续研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集仅限于单相机设置且通常缺乏外部真实值，无法支持多相机光场配准方法的严格评估。

Method: 提供了两种配准方法：基于RANSAC的跨视图点云3D变换估计和从单光场图像估计6自由度位姿的光场PnP算法，两者都明确集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与真实值强对齐，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集和配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了可靠的评估基准。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种循环自监督扩散框架CSS-Diff，用于从低场MRI合成高质量的高场MRI图像，解决了临床保真度差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然更便宜、更易获取且更安全，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖并扩展数据可用性，但现有方法在临床保真度方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了循环自监督扩散框架CSS-Diff，核心思想是在循环一致性约束下重新制定基于扩散的合成方法。包含两个新过程：切片间差距感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性，局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建增强局部特征恢复。

Result: 在跨场合成任务中取得了最先进的性能（PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689）。相比原始低场MRI，能更好地保留细粒度解剖结构（左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%）。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在定量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像，有效解决了低场到高场MRI合成的临床保真度问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

TL;DR: 提出LogViG模型，通过新的对数可扩展图构建方法(LSGC)改进视觉图神经网络，在图像分类和语义分割任务中超越了现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图构建方法如KNN在较大图像上计算昂贵，而SVGA的固定步长尺度会导致过度压缩和缺失长距离连接。需要一种能限制长距离连接数量同时提升性能的图构建方法。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法，并构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型。引入高分辨率分支，在高分辨率和低分辨率分支之间融合特征，形成多尺度高分辨率视觉GNN网络。

Result: LogViG在ImageNet-1K上平均top-1准确率达到79.9%，比Vision GNN提高1.7%，同时参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。在图像分类和语义分割任务中均超越现有架构。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在复制中文书法时存在局限：要么生成高质量单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。

Method: 采用统一扩散框架，联合训练识别和生成任务；使用不对称加噪和栅格化框图提供空间先验；在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上训练。

Conclusion: UniCalli框架通过识别和生成的协同训练，有效提升了书法复制的质量和准确性，并展示了在其他古文字上的良好扩展性。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的多模态推理框架，通过将视觉内容转换为可执行代码来实现可验证的视觉推理，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表）推理时缺乏验证机制的问题，像素级感知无法进行精确验证。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评器选择最忠实的重建，并迭代优化代码，将模糊的感知任务转化为可验证的符号问题。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA、Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅使用代码进行辅助线绘制或裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Method: 设计包含可验证中间推理步骤、唯一真实值和可重复评分协议的基准测试，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型利用概念理解指导视觉合成，或利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进的统一模型、纯生成模型和纯理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖性。

Conclusion: 为理解视觉理解和生成能力何时以及如何相互增强提供了新见解，为推进统一模型建立了可靠基础。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

Motivation: 弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差距，为fMRI数据构建基础模型。

Method: 将4D体积fMRI数据转换为2D fMRI活动平铺图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器(MAE)框架在Human Connectome Project的2.3K小时fMRI数据上训练Vision Transformers。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集规模按严格幂律缩放规律提升，下游分类基准显示模型学习到丰富表示，支持跨受试者的精细状态解码和跨脑状态变化的受试者特定特征解码。

Conclusion: 这项工作是为fMRI数据构建基础模型的持续开放科学项目的一部分，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVC框架用于基于扩散模型的故事续写，通过CLIP检索最相关的历史图像，并在无相关图像时自适应限制视觉条件的影响，同时使用LLM重新标注数据集提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事续写中如何有效利用先前视觉上下文，同时确保与当前文本输入的语义对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义对齐的历史图像，在无相关图像时自适应限制视觉条件在扩散早期阶段的影响，并用LLM重新标注数据集增强文本监督。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估显示AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性场景中。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用视觉上下文，避免误导信息注入，在故事续写任务中实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级水印方案NoisePrints，利用扩散模型初始化过程中的随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要。现有方法需要访问模型权重且计算量大，不实用且不可扩展。

Method: 利用扩散过程初始化时使用的随机种子作为水印，通过哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，确保从内容中恢复有效种子不可行。使用密码学零知识证明在不泄露种子的情况下证明所有权。

Result: 在多个最先进的图像和视频扩散模型上验证了NoisePrints的有效性，展示了仅使用种子和输出即可进行高效验证，无需模型权重。

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的水印方案，能够有效保护扩散模型生成内容的版权，同时保持生成过程不变。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据整理流程，通过数据质量提升和复杂推理增强，训练出的Bee-8B模型在完全开源的MLLM中达到新SOTA，性能可与半开源模型竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前完全开源的多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据。

Method: 引入Honey-Data-15M数据集（约1500万QA对），采用多重清洗技术和新颖的双层CoT增强策略；开发HoneyPipe数据整理流程和DataStudio框架。

Result: 训练的Bee-8B模型在完全开源MLLM中建立新SOTA，性能与InternVL3.5-8B等半开源模型竞争甚至超越。

Conclusion: 专注于数据质量是开发具有竞争力的完全开源MLLM的关键途径，为社区提供数据集、工具链、训练配方和模型权重等基础资源。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的3D表示，首次实现了无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并创建了GCoT数据集来连接定位与空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示；引入GCoT数据集，包含3D边界框标注和集成定位的推理路径。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，无需外部模块即可实现自回归定位，性能与最先进模型相当，并显著提升了空间推理能力。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明了3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过紧密集成定位与推理实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为稠密的3D轨迹场，并开发Trace Anything神经网络单次前向预测整个轨迹场，在轨迹估计和点追踪任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的像素在时间维度上形成连续的3D轨迹，这是理解视频动态的基本单元。基于此原理，需要开发能够有效表示和预测这些时空轨迹的方法。

Method: 将视频表示为Trajectory Field，为每个像素分配连续的3D轨迹函数。Trace Anything网络通过单次前向传播预测每个像素的控制点，用B样条参数化轨迹。

Result: 在轨迹场估计新基准上达到SOTA性能，在点追踪基准上表现竞争力；单次前向范式带来显著效率提升；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等涌现能力。

Conclusion: Trajectory Field表示和Trace Anything模型为视频动态建模提供了有效解决方案，在性能、效率和功能多样性方面均有优势。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

TL;DR: 提出了Generative Universal Verifier概念，用于多模态推理中的视觉结果验证和优化，包括构建ViVerBench基准、训练OmniVerifier-7B验证器、以及提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉验证任务上表现不佳，与人类水平存在显著差距，需要可靠的视觉验证能力来支持多模态推理过程。

Method: 1) 构建ViVerBench基准评估视觉结果；2) 设计自动化流水线构建大规模验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器；3) 提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展方法进行迭代优化。

Result: OmniVerifier在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推动了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展的测试时优化，是迈向更可信和可控的下一代推理系统的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

TL;DR: VisCoP通过向视觉编码器添加少量可学习的视觉探针，实现跨域视觉语言模型的高效适应，在多个挑战性域适应设置中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在面临与预训练数据分布差异较大的新领域时性能急剧下降，而传统的微调方法要么学习有限域特定特征，要么导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出视觉上下文探针(VisCoP)，在视觉编码器中添加紧凑的可学习视觉探针，实现高效域特定适应，同时最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三个挑战性域适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标域获得优越性能并有效保留源域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP提供了一种高效且有效的视觉语言模型域适应方法，能够应对多种类型的分布偏移，同时保持模型原有能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉逼真的视频，但常常违反物理规律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件，并应用基于人类反馈的强化学习来优化物理表征

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其能力，并能泛化到广泛的物理场景

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习，为物理感知视频生成提供了通用且可插拔的解决方案

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration
videos, code, checkpoints and our dataset are available on our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种将高斯过程隐式曲面（GPIS）作为控制屏障函数（CBF）的统一框架，通过稀疏化方法解决计算复杂度问题，并在机械臂和四旋翼飞行器的避障任务中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合水平集方法和控制屏障函数的安全技术，以及距离场表示的几何形状隐式曲面，探索将隐式曲面本身作为CBF的统一框架。

Method: 使用高斯过程隐式曲面表示安全边界，利用传感器测量的安全样本来训练GP。GP后验均值定义安全隐式曲面，后验方差提供鲁棒安全边界。开发稀疏高斯CBF解决计算复杂度问题。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂操作斯坦福兔子和四旋翼飞行器在3D空间中绕椅子导航的实验中，高斯CBF（包括稀疏版本）实现了安全交互和无碰撞轨迹执行。

Conclusion: 高斯过程隐式曲面可以成功合成控制屏障函数，稀疏化方法有效解决了计算复杂度问题，为安全控制提供了新的统一框架。

Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier
functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for
geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we
propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We
leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety
boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to
condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface
(safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin.
Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and
analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this
issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of
our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We
validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated
7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor
navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with
and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of
trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MPPI方法在跟踪平滑低速轨迹时性能不足，需要开发能够在复杂环境中实现高速自主飞行的控制器。

Method: 使用几何SE(3)控制生成部分轨迹，引入变化的仿真时间步长和动态成本噪声参数，并与立体深度相机集成实现在线避障。

Result: 在仿真中能跟踪敏捷轨迹且位置误差与几何SE(3)控制器相当，在森林环境中以13m/s速度避障，优于现有避障规划器。真实实验中以10m/s速度跟踪轨迹并避障。

Conclusion: GMPPI成功结合了轨迹跟踪精度和高速避障能力，是实现复杂环境中自主无人机飞行的关键进展。

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral
(GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories
while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of
candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal
control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using
geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories,
significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce
varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise
parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed
trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth
camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step
towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller
can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to
the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed
controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of
up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware
planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile
trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于经验库的3D刚体路径规划方法，通过重用历史路径来加速新物体的规划过程，特别适用于狭窄通道场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采样规划器在狭窄通道中效率低下，且每次规划都从头开始，浪费了历史规划经验。在机器人应用中，不同物体需要在相同环境中规划路径，重用历史经验可以显著提高效率。

Method: 构建历史路径库，为新物体寻找库中最相似的物体，将其路径作为近似解，通过相互变换调整后，在配置空间中沿近似路径进行采样。

Result: 在多种狭窄通道场景中测试，相比OMPL库中的先进方法，速度提升显著（所需时间减少高达85%），在传统规划器失败的情况下也能找到解。

Conclusion: 基于经验重用的路径规划方法能有效解决3D刚体在狭窄通道中的规划问题，显著提高规划效率，并已开源发布。

Abstract: Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a
search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless,
essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The
commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees,
struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing
the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking,
various objects must be transported through the same environment. However,
traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information
gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past
solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a
new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when
planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use
its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual
transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate
paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared
with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant
speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method,
often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our
implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于线虫Omega转向的仿生控制方法，通过叠加两个行波来生成转向运动，使无肢和多足细长机器人能够在复杂环境中实现稳健有效的转向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细长无肢机器人在搜救和工业检测等应用中具有通过狭窄空间的潜力，但现有研究缺乏有效的转向策略。受线虫在复杂环境中卓越机动性的启发，特别是其Omega转向能力，需要开发相应的控制方法。

Method: 采用理论-生物学比较方法，将Omega转向描述为两个行波的叠加。基于此波方程设计控制器，并在实验室和复杂野外环境中验证。

Result: 设计的控制器使细长机器人能够在实验室和复杂野外环境中实现稳健有效的转向行为，并且该Omega转向控制器还能推广到多足细长机器人。

Conclusion: 基于线虫Omega转向的波方程控制方法为细长机器人（无论有无肢体）提供了一种有效的身体驱动转向策略，展示了生物启发的机器人控制方法的通用性。

Abstract: Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly
packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial
inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate
limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been
limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective
and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a
microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in
rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform
omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it
remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an
omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a
comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a
superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we
design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning
behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such
omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots,
demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for
elongate robots, with and without limbs.

Motivation: 解决机器人从少量未标定的人类演示视频中学习复杂6自由度操作技能的挑战，减少对大量标注数据和复杂传感器设置的依赖

Method: 提出神经功能表示，将几何、视觉外观和功能线索整合到轻量神经网络中；采用检索机制和粗到细优化策略来转移精确的6自由度操作策略

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中显著优于现有方法，在13个任务上平均成功率提升14.9个百分点，每个任务仅需2-3个演示视频

Conclusion: Actron3D证明了从少量未标定人类视频中学习可迁移6自由度操作技能的可行性，为机器人技能学习提供了高效的新途径

Abstract: We present Actron3D, a framework that enables robots to acquire transferable
6-DoF manipulation skills from just a few monocular, uncalibrated, RGB-only
human videos. At its core lies the Neural Affordance Function, a compact
object-centric representation that distills actionable cues from diverse
uncalibrated videos-geometry, visual appearance, and affordance-into a
lightweight neural network, forming a memory bank of manipulation skills.
During deployment, we adopt a pipeline that retrieves relevant affordance
functions and transfers precise 6-DoF manipulation policies via coarse-to-fine
optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded
in the neural functions. Experiments in both simulation and the real world
demonstrate that Actron3D significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving a
14.9 percentage point improvement in average success rate across 13 tasks while
requiring only 2-3 demonstration videos per task.

TL;DR: UNCAP提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的规划方法，通过轻量级自然语言消息进行CAV间通信，并明确考虑感知不确定性，实现高效且可解释的大规模协同自动驾驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖传输高带宽原始传感器数据流，要么忽略共享数据中的感知和规划不确定性，导致系统既不可扩展也不安全。

Method: 采用两阶段通信协议：首先识别最相关的车辆子集进行信息交换，然后选定的CAV传输定量表达感知不确定性的消息，通过选择性融合最大化互信息的消息来整合最相关信号。

Result: 实验显示通信带宽减少63%，驾驶安全评分提高31%，决策不确定性降低61%，在接近碰撞事件中碰撞距离裕度提高四倍。

Conclusion: UNCAP通过不确定性引导的自然语言通信策略，显著提高了协同自动驾驶的可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在轨服务、组装和制造(ISAM)操作对提高空间资产的寿命和能力至关重要，但机械臂在自由飞行卫星上的运动会产生复杂的扰动，需要实验验证相关动力学模型。

Method: 设计开发了一个硬件在环实验测试平台，使用6自由度UR3e机械臂连接到卫星总线，卫星总线安装在1自由度导轨系统上，使系统能够在一个线性方向上自由移动。

Result: 该实验系统能够模拟ISAM操作，为验证空间运动、串行机器人操作和接触力学模型提供了实验平台。

Conclusion: 提出的硬件在环测试平台有效解决了ISAM操作中动力学模型验证的挑战，为相关研究提供了重要的实验手段。

Abstract: In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging
operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity,
mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial
robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations,
however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement
of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem
requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed,
experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that
the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom
(6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the
design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed
utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a
6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is
mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic
arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation
system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot
manipulation, and contact mechanics.

Motivation: 为了快速创建交互式铰接资产，将基于部件的形状建模与功能装配设计相结合。

Method: 使用运动学感知的附着能量，结合退火黎曼朗之万动力学采样器，处理几何约束和功能目标。

Result: 框架生成了广泛的铰接形状，在几何、运动学和功能指标上显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过紧密耦合运动学感知的几何匹配与功能驱动的优化，该框架实现了铰接资产的快速创建。

Abstract: We introduce Kinematic Kitbashing, an automatic framework that synthesizes
functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models.
Given a kinematic graph with a small collection of articulated parts, our
optimizer jointly solves for the spatial placement of every part so that (i)
attachments remain geometrically sound over the entire range of motion and (ii)
the assembled object satisfies user-specified functional goals such as
collision-free actuation, reachability, or trajectory following. At its core is
a kinematics-aware attachment energy that aligns vector distance function
features sampled across multiple articulation snapshots. We embed this
attachment term within an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that
treats functionality objectives as additional energies, enabling robust global
exploration while accommodating non-differentiable functionality objectives and
constraints. Our framework produces a wide spectrum of assembled articulated
shapes, from trash-can wheels grafted onto car bodies to multi-segment lamps,
gear-driven paddlers, and reconfigurable furniture, and delivers strong
quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric,
kinematic, and functional metrics. By tightly coupling articulation-aware
geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, Kinematic Kitbashing
bridges part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design, empowering
rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉-语言-动作模型中最简单但未被充分研究的策略——将动作直接表示为文本，而非引入复杂的动作令牌或特殊动作头。

Method: 提出VLA-0模型，采用将动作表示为文本的简单设计，通过特定的技术实现来释放这种简单设计的潜力。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，VLA-0超越了所有基于相同机器人数据训练的方法，包括π0.5-KI、OpenVLA-OFT和SmolVLA。即使没有大规模机器人特定训练，也超越了基于大规模机器人数据训练的方法。在真实世界测试中同样优于SmolVLA。

Conclusion: 将动作表示为文本的简单VLA设计不仅有效，而且出人意料地强大，在适当的技术实现下能够超越更复杂的模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling
generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an
open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the
existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or
introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of
representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This
work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only
effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0
outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating
VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,
including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without
large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on
large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.
These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms
SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper
summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques
required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

Method: 提出RoboHiMan分层评估范式，包括HiMan-Bench基准测试（原子和组合任务）、多级训练数据集和三种评估模式（vanilla、decoupled、coupled）。

Conclusion: RoboHiMan为系统研究组合泛化提供了新范式，揭示了分层架构中的瓶颈，有助于开发更适合真实世界长时程操作的模型。

Abstract: Enabling robots to flexibly schedule and compose learned skills for novel
long-horizon manipulation under diverse perturbations remains a core challenge.
Early explorations with end-to-end VLA models show limited success, as these
models struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. Hierarchical
approaches, where high-level planners generate subgoals for low-level policies,
bring certain improvements but still suffer under complex perturbations,
revealing limited capability in skill composition. However, existing benchmarks
primarily emphasize task completion in long-horizon settings, offering little
insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay
between planning and execution. To systematically investigate these gaps, we
propose RoboHiMan, a hierarchical evaluation paradigm for compositional
generalization in long-horizon manipulation. RoboHiMan introduces HiMan-Bench,
a benchmark of atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations,
supported by a multi-level training dataset for analyzing progressive data
scaling, and proposes three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled)
that probe the necessity of skill composition and reveal bottlenecks in
hierarchical architectures. Experiments highlight clear capability gaps across
representative models and architectures, pointing to directions for advancing
models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks. Videos and

Motivation: 当前点对平面ICP算法在结构化环境中表现良好，但在特征稀疏、重复几何结构和高频运动场景下会出现6自由度姿态估计退化问题，现有LiDAR-only解决方案仍存在局限性。

Method: 1. 基于表面法线和邻域分析的点云分类（地面、墙壁、屋顶、边缘和非平面点）

Conclusion: 该系统通过多度量方法和退化感知机制，有效解决了LiDAR SLAM在挑战性环境中的定位精度问题，为LiDAR-only解决方案提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for
enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various
applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec-
tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios
with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency
motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most
state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating
additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face
limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module.
Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based
on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into
ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate
correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm
is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan
Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures.
DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy,
especially in indoor environments such as long corridors

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法通常只将视觉触觉反馈作为额外观察，而施加的力只是夹爪命令的不可控结果，无法精确控制操作过程中的抓取力。

Method: 使用集成了GelSight Mini视觉触觉传感器的改进版手持UMI夹爪收集人类演示，开发了匹配几何形状的驱动版UMI夹爪用于策略部署，提出的FARM扩散策略联合预测机器人位姿、夹爪宽度和夹持力。

Result: FARM在三个具有不同力要求（高力、低力和动态力适应）的任务中优于多个基线方法，证明了其两个关键组件的优势：利用基于力的高维触觉观测和基于力的控制空间。

Conclusion: FARM框架通过整合触觉数据和力控制，在接触丰富的操作任务中实现了更好的力控制性能，代码和设计文件已开源。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces
throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or
deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat
visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces
as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present
Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that
integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force
signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect
human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal
Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual
tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated
variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During
policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot
pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across
three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and
dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key
components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations
and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced

Conclusion: MODUR成功实现了模块化自重构机器人的双层级重构能力，为未来机器人系统提供了更高的适应性和灵活性。

Abstract: Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots
capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological
relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in
various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring
dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable
mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level
self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while
each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The
design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage
groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of
achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration
capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent
connectors, is comprehensively analyzed, laying a theoretical foundation for
the design of the module's basic motion. Finally, the motion of MODUR is
validated through a series of experiments.

Motivation: 离线强化学习虽然样本效率高，但策略在动作空间扰动下仍很脆弱，需要提高对执行器故障等不确定性的适应能力。

Method: 在干净数据上训练策略，然后进行对抗性微调，注入动作扰动诱导补偿行为，使用指数移动平均信号调整扰动概率的课程学习策略。

Result: 在连续控制运动任务中，该方法比纯离线基线显著提升鲁棒性，比从头训练收敛更快，匹配微调与评估条件时鲁棒性最强。

Conclusion: 对抗性微调能够在不确定环境中实现自适应和鲁棒控制，弥合离线效率与在线适应性之间的差距。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition
without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets
remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This
study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean
data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are
injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve
resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation
probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing
robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on
continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges
faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation
conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while
the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal
performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results
show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under
uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online
adaptability.

Conclusion: 该框架在短期和长期康复场景中均表现出鲁棒性能和强泛化能力，为膝关节角度预测提供了有效的迁移学习解决方案。

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint
angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However,
these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability,
non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve
optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee
joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects.
Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and
the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels
relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM
model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then
transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved
Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for
one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone.
Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5
percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal
subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and
interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE
for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate
robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term
rehabilitation scenarios.

Method: 使用Unitree Go2机器人在13.24米钢混结构振荡桥上训练，采用PPO强化学习算法在MuJoCo仿真中训练15种运动策略，结合五种步态和三种训练条件，并通过领域随机化实现零样本迁移到真实世界。

Result: 在振荡桥面上训练的策略表现出比在刚性表面上训练的策略更优越的稳定性和适应性，即使没有事先接触过桥梁也能实现鲁棒的步态模式。

Conclusion: 基于仿真的强化学习能够有效提高四足机器人在动态地面扰动下的运动能力，为设计能够穿越振动环境的机器人提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains,
yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from
oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel
approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2
robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure
with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies,
combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training
conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing
height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain
randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results
demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior
stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our
framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.
These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve
quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for
designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型欠驱动自适应机械手Hockens-A Hand，通过集成Hoeckens机构、双平行四边形连杆和专用四杆机构，仅使用单个线性执行器实现三种自适应抓取模式：平行夹持、非对称铲取和包络抓取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够在非结构化环境中实现自适应和顺应性抓取的机械手，通过被动机械智能减少执行器数量，提高系统的适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用Hoeckens机构引入垂直方向顺应性，双平行四边形连杆确保指尖线接触，四杆放大系统实现不同抓取模式间的自然过渡，并通过网格纹理硅胶指节增强包络能力。进行了详细的运动学分析和优化设计。

Result: 仿真验证了指尖运动和抓取模式间的平滑过渡，实验使用3D打印原型验证了三种抓取模式在各种环境约束下的抓取稳定性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: Hockens-A Hand通过巧妙的机械设计实现了仅用单个执行器的多模式自适应抓取，在非结构化环境中表现出良好的适应性和抓取性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A
Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage,
and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes:
parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand
requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical
intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured
environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism
introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at
the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural
transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a
mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects
of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to
optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance.
Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring
smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was
analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's
performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates
the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental
constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hoecken-D Hand是一种欠驱动机器人抓手，结合改进的Hoecken连杆和差动弹簧机构，实现线性平行夹持和自适应包络抓取，仅需单个线性驱动器即可工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够在结构化抓取和自适应抓取之间无缝切换的机器人抓手，以应对非结构化环境中各种几何形状的物体，同时保持简单性和成本效益。

Method: 重新配置Hoecken连杆，用差动连杆替换一个构件，保持直线引导同时实现接触触发重构；采用双平行四边形保持指尖平行性；差动机构允许手指在遇到障碍时向内包裹。

Result: 原型实现了约200mm的线性夹持范围，在多种物体几何形状上可靠地执行两种抓取模式，展示了紧凑、适应性强且成本效益高的解决方案。

Conclusion: Hoecken-D Hand通过创新的机械设计成功实现了线性夹持和自适应包络抓取的结合，为非结构化环境中的操作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that
combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to
achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive
envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member
with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling
contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A
double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during
conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to
wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or
thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,
minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its
own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force
analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces
and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was
prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of
approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both
modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand
as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in
unstructured environments.

human-robot interaction (HRI) and other related concepts, we will develop a new
interface with the goal of a non-expert teleoperation system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用触觉数据同时确定刚性物体形状和位置的学习与探索框架，通过优化物理约束违反的损失函数来学习立方体和凸多面体几何形状，在首次接触后仅需不到10秒的随机收集数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人操作需要处理未见过的物体，学习物理精确模型在测试时能提供数据效率、可预测性和任务间重用的显著优势。触觉感知可以补充视觉感知，但其时间稀疏性需要仔细的在线探索以保持数据效率。

Method: 基于接触丰富系统识别的最新进展，制定了一个惩罚物理约束违反的损失函数，而不引入刚体接触固有的数值刚度。通过优化这个损失，可以学习几何形状，并使用最大化期望信息增益的探索方案。

Result: 能够学习立方体和凸多面体几何形状，在首次接触后仅需不到10秒的随机收集数据。在模拟和真实机器人实验中，探索方案显著加快了学习速度。

Conclusion: 该框架仅使用触觉数据就能同时确定刚性物体的形状和位置，具有高效的学习能力和显著的数据效率优势。

Abstract: General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen
objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide
significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between
tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,
but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain
data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move,
requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a
learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to
simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal
robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification
to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation
without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.
Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with
less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration
scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly
faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments. More information

Conclusion: PlanarMesh系统在保持实时性能的同时，实现了高精度的3D重建和显著的数据压缩效果。

Abstract: Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface
reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task.
In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR
reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve
compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new
representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to
capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be
incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space
information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture
with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast
search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show
that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding,
state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions,
occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file
sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than
mesh-based methods) and maintaining real-time performance (around 2 Hz for a
64-beam sensor).

Abstract: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part
of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing.
Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring
proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product.
In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to
fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of
varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated
with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft
finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the
steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data,
to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in
incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and
stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values
which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels
and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects
of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce
identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective
distribution based on ripeness levels.

Method: 开发了一种离线可视化方法，生成向量场图来表征配准点云对之间的局部差异，通过模式识别帮助分析人员推理干扰机制。

Result: 在仿真研究和现场实验两个概念验证示例中，人类分析人员能够推理一系列干扰机制，并迭代地从原始数据中移除这些机制。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效帮助分析人员识别和分类激光雷达扫描匹配中的干扰模式，通过逐步移除干扰机制来关注更小的差异。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a visualization methodology to aid a human analyst
in classifying adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching. Our methodology
is intended for offline rather than real-time analysis. The method generates a
vector-field plot that characterizes local discrepancies between a pair of
registered point clouds. The vector field plot reveals patterns that would be
difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After
introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept
examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both
data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity
mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help
focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.

Motivation: 当前VLA模型在基准测试中报告了令人印象深刻的成功率，但这些结果可能掩盖了鲁棒性方面的根本弱点。作者旨在通过系统性扰动分析揭示模型在真实环境中的实际能力。

Method: 在七个维度引入受控扰动：物体布局、相机视角、机器人初始状态、语言指令、光照条件、背景纹理和传感器噪声，对多个最先进的模型进行全面分析。

Result: 模型表现出极端的敏感性，在适度扰动下性能从95%降至30%以下。令人惊讶的是，模型对语言变化不敏感，进一步实验显示模型倾向于完全忽略语言指令。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了高基准分数等同于真正能力的假设，强调需要评估在真实变化下的可靠性，而不仅仅是基准测试性能。

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Abstract: Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture,
logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based
autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications.
This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where
traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has
become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has
shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing
arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is
still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly
controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are
analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is
available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a
challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were
never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of
professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data
from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

Abstract: Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become
proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are
still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an
approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple
robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first
voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels
are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using
standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce
highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of
tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to
traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the
meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a
live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly
robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user
design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we
introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel
handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization,
hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of
meter-scale objects.

Motivation: 推动指令跟随机器人向可扩展、通用智能发展，解决指令与机器人动作之间的空间关联问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：1）在230万+空间推理数据上进行空间定位预训练，确定"在哪里行动"；2）通过即插即用的空间提示进行空间引导的动作后训练，决定"如何行动"。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于无空间引导的变体：SimplerEnv Google Robot +14.6%，WidowX +17%，LIBERO Franka +4.3%。在真实世界集群拾放任务中提升7.3%，在未见物体和新配置上通过合成协同训练实现+20.6%提升。

Conclusion: 空间引导训练是构建可扩展和鲁棒的通用机器人的统一原则，在长时程推理密集型场景中比现有工作提升超过10%。

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

TL;DR: 提出LT-Gate脉冲神经元模型，通过双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制解决SNN在持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，在时序分类任务中显著提升准确率和记忆保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在神经形态硬件上具有能效优势，但在需要快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中表现不佳，特别是面临稳定性-可塑性困境。

Method: LT-Gate模型让每个脉冲神经元并行跟踪快慢两个时间尺度的信息，通过学习的门控机制局部调整其影响，并引入方差跟踪正则化来稳定发放活动。

Result: 在时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的约46%和先前SNN方法，且无需外部重放或昂贵正交化。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控能显著增强SNN的持续学习能力，缩小脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距，并完全兼容神经形态硬件。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM4TS模型中的伪对齐问题，提出了TimeSUP技术来解决这一问题，通过增加时间序列流形维度来匹配语言嵌入的内在维度，从而提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐问题导致许多时间序列大语言模型表现不佳，甚至不如线性模型或随机初始化模型，但社区对此问题的根源讨论有限。

Method: 提出TimeSUP技术，通过增加时间序列流形维度来更接近语言嵌入的内在维度，使模型能够清晰区分时间信号，同时捕捉跨模态共享结构。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，并能无缝集成到四种现有LLM4TS流程中，显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 伪对齐源于预训练LLM组件中的锥效应与时间序列数据固有低维流形的相互作用，TimeSUP通过调整流形维度有效缓解了这一问题。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

*Haolin Li,Hoda Bidkhori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGTEA是一个联邦类增量学习框架，通过高斯任务嵌入和对齐来捕获任务特定知识并量化模型不确定性，在保持通信效率的同时显著减轻遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的类增量学习问题，需要同时处理统计异质性、任务序列扩展性和隐私保护等挑战。

Method: 客户端使用Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder(CATE)生成高斯分布的任务嵌入，服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离衡量任务间差距并强制任务分离。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实验表明，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著减轻了遗忘问题，并持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和Wasserstein对齐，为联邦类增量学习提供了一个可扩展且通信高效的解决方案，同时保护了任务级隐私。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现平衡传播(EP)的方法，将能量下降、梯度下降和朗之万动力学统一起来，在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上取得了竞争性的准确率，同时保持了在硬件约束下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用物理系统自然执行能量下降的特性来加速机器学习，特别是能量基模型(EBMs)在传统处理器上的瓶颈问题，探索在物理硬件上直接实现优化的可能性。

Method: 在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现平衡传播(EP)，将优化、梯度下降和采样过程统一到单一总能量景观的下降中，使用局部学习规则而非全局反向传播。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST数据集上达到88.0±0.1%的准确率，在参数量化和相位噪声等实际硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 振荡器伊辛机是快速、节能的神经形态学习基底，能量基模型可以在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上找到实际实现途径。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个理论框架，证明在状态对抗MDP中，剪枝可以收紧认证鲁棒性边界，而不会降低策略的鲁棒性。通过三术语遗憾分解揭示了性能-鲁棒性权衡边界，并在实验中发现在适度稀疏度下存在鲁棒性提升且不影响甚至增强清洁性能的"甜蜜点"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习策略需要在对抗扰动下保持可靠性，而现代深度RL代理过度参数化导致成本高和脆弱性。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提高鲁棒性，但其在对抗RL中的作用尚不清楚。

Method: 为状态对抗MDP开发了首个认证鲁棒性理论框架，针对高斯和分类策略以及Lipschitz网络，证明逐元素剪枝只能收紧认证鲁棒性边界。提出了三术语遗憾分解方法，分离清洁任务性能、剪枝引起的性能损失和鲁棒性增益。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中评估了幅度剪枝和微剪枝策略，发现在适度稀疏水平下存在可复现的"甜蜜点"，鲁棒性显著提升而不损害甚至有时增强清洁性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，更是实现鲁棒强化学习的结构性干预手段，能够在不牺牲性能的前提下提升策略的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

Motivation: 基于大规模去标识化电子健康记录训练的基础模型在临床应用中具有潜力，但其记忆患者信息的能力引发了重要的隐私担忧，特别是对弱势群体的影响。

Method: 开发了一套黑盒评估测试，包括在嵌入层和生成层探测记忆的方法，旨在区分模型泛化和有害记忆，并在临床相关环境中进行验证。

Result: 在公开可用的电子健康记录基础模型上验证了该方法，并发布了开源工具包以促进医疗AI中可重现和协作的隐私评估。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于评估和减轻基础模型在医疗领域应用中的隐私风险，特别关注患者隐私保护，尤其是弱势群体的隐私安全。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态可解释AI框架，通过注意力增强特征融合、Grad-CAM++局部解释和揭示-修正反馈循环来检测和缓解偏见，在MNIST多模态扩展数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准数据集如MNIST往往无法暴露潜在偏见和多模态特征复杂性，限制了深度神经网络在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 统一了注意力增强特征融合、基于Grad-CAM++的局部解释和用于偏见检测与缓解的揭示-修正反馈循环。

Result: 在MNIST多模态扩展数据集上达到93.2%分类准确率、91.6% F1分数和78.1%解释保真度，优于单模态和非可解释基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过将可解释性与偏见感知学习相结合，增强了鲁棒性和人类对齐，为敏感领域可信AI提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自信内点外推框架(CI-EX)，用于信用评分中的拒绝推断问题，通过迭代识别被拒客户样本分布并基于监督分类模型概率分配标签，在保持AUC竞争力的同时显著提升拒绝推断特定指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法假设被拒客户行为可以从已接受客户外推，但忽略了两个群体之间可能存在的分布差异，导致盲目外推问题。

Method: CI-EX框架迭代使用异常检测模型识别被拒客户样本分布，基于监督分类模型概率为最接近已接受群体分布的个体分配标签。

Result: 在两个大型真实信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标上持续优于现有方法，同时在大多数实验中保持AUC的竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常需要在AUC和拒绝推断特定指标之间权衡，但提出的CI-EX框架在拒绝推断特定指标上表现优异，同时维持了AUC的竞争力。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)估计器，该方法比现有方法更高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LID估计方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限场景下适用性有限。

Method: 证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，并使用该损失作为LID估计器，同时分析隐式分数匹配损失与FLIPD估计器的关系。

Result: 在流形基准和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和内存占用方面优于现有方法，特别是在问题规模和量化级别增加时。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高效且可扩展的LID估计器，适用于计算和内存受限的场景。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

TL;DR: 提出了FADE指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来评估分布相似性，解决了现有遗忘指标依赖特定参考的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘评估指标基于参考响应或分类器输出，而非核心目标：评估遗忘模型是否与从未接触过不需要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种参考特定方法存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出功能性对齐分布等价性(FADE)指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来测量分布相似性。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，传统指标接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价性，许多模型在遗忘后反而离黄金标准更远。

Conclusion: FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础，揭示了当前评估实践的根本差距。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs推理能力的具体来源和机制，特别是优化推理（在约束条件下寻找极值）这一基础抽象能力，该能力在规划、控制、资源分配和提示搜索等关键应用中具有重要作用。

Method: 引入ExtremBench基准数据集，包含93个标准化的极值求解问题，源自中国数学奥林匹克竞赛的不等式练习。对多个先进开源模型家族（Qwen3、GPT-OSS、DeepSeek）进行了广泛评估。

Result: 研究发现LLMs的极值求解推理能力与当前数学基准（如AIME25和MATH-500）的评估结果并不总是一致，有些模型在一般数学推理上表现强但在极值求解上表现差，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在关键差距，现有基准测试可能无法全面捕捉数学推理能力的全谱系，需要更专门的评估工具来准确衡量LLMs的优化推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 刚性系统的时间积分在燃烧、高超声速等反应输运系统中是主要计算成本来源。刚性会引入比其他物理过程小得多的时间尺度，需要极小的显式时间步长或计算密集的隐式方法。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动框架在单细胞扰动预测中容易陷入Waddington景观的局部最优，导致轨迹陷入虚假谱系或不合理的分化结果，需要更好的初始化方法来逃离局部最优。

Conclusion: 所提出的多阶段强化学习初始化方法能够有效避免局部最优，收敛到正确的细胞谱系，在单细胞扰动建模中表现出优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的工作流成功解决了焊缝检测中的数据稀缺和噪声问题，实现了工业环境下的自动化检测。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的Koopman算子学习方法，通过平衡表示简洁性和表达能力来解决传统方法中潜在空间崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子的无限维特性使得寻找合适的有限维子空间具有挑战性，特别是在深度架构中。现有方法在表示学习中存在信息瓶颈困境：难以同时实现压缩表示的简洁性和预测能力。

Method: 提出信息论拉格朗日公式，通过潜在互信息促进简洁性，通过冯·诺依曼熵维持表达能力以防止模式崩溃。基于此开发新算法，平衡简洁性和表达性。

Result: 在多种动力系统上验证了方法的有效性，相比现有Koopman学习方法性能有所提升，并可视化学习到的流形，观察结果与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 信息论视角下的Koopman学习能够产生稳定且可解释的表示，成功解决了潜在空间模式多样性不足的问题。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个可解释的AI框架，通过结合高分辨率操作模型和理想化模型的优势来改进地球系统模拟，特别在纠正CMIP6中厄尔尼诺模式的偏差方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高分辨率操作模型存在持续偏差，特别是在模拟极端事件和统计分布方面；而理想化模型虽然能精确校准特定特征，但各模型之间存在学科壁垒。需要结合不同复杂度模型的互补优势。

Method: 利用重新配置的潜在数据同化技术，构建连接模型层次结构的可解释AI框架，利用理想化模型的稀疏输出，创建继承操作模型高分辨率和全面变量的桥接模型。

Result: 桥接模型在保持操作模型高分辨率的同时，通过理想化模型的针对性改进实现了全局精度提升，显著纠正了CMIP6中厄尔尼诺时空模式的偏差。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了黑盒校正，提供了物理洞察理解，为有效的物理辅助数字孪生和不确定性量化提供了计算效率高的解决方案，同时强调了推进理想化模型发展和建模社区间交流的重要性。

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

Abstract: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two
optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well
as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during
training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid
over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that
introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,
implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，明确捕捉流数据的时变目标函数特性。分析均匀权重和折扣权重两种策略，在梯度下降更新下推导跟踪误差的紧致界。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差以𝒪(1/t)速率渐近消失，折扣权重会产生由折扣因子和每时间步梯度更新次数控制的非零误差下限。

Conclusion: 理论分析揭示了不同权重策略在流数据学习中的性能差异，数值模拟验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了KL正则化在博弈论环境中的理论优势，提出了OMG和SOMG算法，在矩阵博弈和马尔可夫博弈中实现了对数级后悔，且后悔随KL正则化强度β的增大而减小。

Method: 提出了两种算法：OMG用于矩阵博弈，基于最佳响应采样和乐观奖励；SOMG用于马尔可夫博弈，使用最佳响应采样和超乐观奖励概念。

Result: 两种算法都实现了对数级后悔，后悔随KL正则化强度β的增大而减小，同时保持了与未正则化方法相同的标准后悔界。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论环境中确实能带来理论上的样本效率提升，为实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了新指数的性能，并与广泛使用的聚类有效性指标进行了比较

Conclusion: 提出的紧密度和分离度指数能够有效识别真实聚类数量，优于传统聚类有效性指标

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Method: 采用学习优化范式，使用多层Transformer通过残差连接迭代优化信道和波束成形特征，并引入课程学习、半摊销学习和滑动窗口训练三种策略来增强训练效果。

Result: 在低到中等信噪比下优于现有基线方法，在高信噪比下接近WMMSE性能，同时推理速度显著快于迭代和在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该无监督深度学习框架为大规模MU-MISO波束成形提供了一种高效解决方案，在性能和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

Motivation: 传统营销组合建模方法依赖线性回归或贝叶斯层次模型，假设营销渠道间独立且难以捕捉复杂的时间动态和非线性饱和效应。

Method: 使用门控循环单元(GRUs)自动学习时间模式(如广告存量效应和滞后)，通过有向无环图(DAG)学习营销渠道间的统计依赖和潜在因果结构，并基于Hill方程实现饱和曲线建模。

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM通过结合深度学习和因果推理，有效解决了传统营销组合建模的局限性，提供了更准确和实用的营销效果分析工具。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Conclusion: 提出的稀疏三角传输映射框架在保持表达性的同时实现了计算效率，为大型晶格场理论的采样提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Conclusion: CoDa-FL框架通过聚类导向和依赖感知的方法，有效优化了联邦学习在多任务移动边缘计算环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Motivation: 研究连续时间模型中dropout正则化的理论基础，通过随机批次方法降低计算成本，同时保持正则化效果。

Method: 使用随机批次方法构建无偏估计器，通过采样时间间隔为h的神经元批次来模拟dropout，建立轨迹收敛和分布稳定性分析，并进行Pontryagin伴随分析。

Result: 在轨迹层面实现了线性收敛率，在分布层面获得了总变差误差为h^{1/2}的稳定性，训练过程中控制了最优成本和梯度的偏差，并在实验中观察到预测的收敛率和正则化效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在连续时间模型中有效实现了dropout正则化，具有理论保证和实际优势，包括良好的运行时间和内存特性。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的准动态程序表示框架，通过建模程序的优化敏感性来超越传统静态和动态表示之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的程序表示方法存在两难：静态表示高效但无法洞察程序在复杂代码变换下的行为，动态表示能提供性能洞察但开销巨大且非确定性。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 引入程序行为谱表示，通过用多样化优化序列探测程序的中间表示并量化静态特征变化。使用乘积量化将连续反应向量离散化为结构化子词，并用多任务Transformer模型PQ-BERT预训练学习这些行为代码的深度上下文语法。

Result: 在两个代表性编译器优化任务（最佳传递预测和-Oz收益预测）上的综合实验表明，该方法优于最先进的静态基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的准动态框架成功超越了传统程序表示方法的局限性，为编译器优化中的机器学习应用提供了更有效的程序表示。

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效构建完全等变图神经网络的理论框架，通过规范形式和满秩可操纵基集实现完全性，显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变GNNs为实现完全性需要深层架构、高体阶或高维可操纵特征，导致高计算成本且缺乏多项式时间解

Method: 基于理论证明，使用几何图的规范形式和满秩可操纵基集构建完全等变GNNs，在EGNN和TFN模型基础上提出高效算法

Result: 实验表明该模型仅需少量层数即实现优越的完全性和性能，显著减少计算开销同时保持强大实用效果

Conclusion: 该框架为构建高效实用的完全等变GNNs提供了理论基础，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算复杂度

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Motivation: 跨模态知识蒸馏技术虽然应用广泛，但缺乏理论指导，导致效果不稳定。需要建立理论框架来解释何时跨模态知识蒸馏有效。

Method: 提出跨模态互补性假设(CCH)，在联合高斯模型中进行理论验证，并在图像、文本、视频、音频和癌症组学等多模态数据集上进行实证研究。

Result: 理论验证和实证结果都支持CCH假设，建立了跨模态知识蒸馏的理论基础，并提供了选择最优教师模态的实用指南。

Conclusion: CCH为理解跨模态知识蒸馏提供了新的理论框架，基于CCH标准可以选择最优教师模态来提升较弱模态的性能。

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管transformer在离线或基于模型的强化学习中很有效，但在在线无模型强化学习中仍未被充分探索，主要由于其训练设置和模型设计决策的敏感性。

Method: 研究了关键设计问题：如何条件化输入、在actor和critic之间共享组件、以及如何切分序列数据进行训练。

Result: 实验揭示了稳定的架构和训练策略，在完全和部分可观测任务中，以及向量和图像设置中都能获得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用transformer提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

TL;DR: CleverCatch是一个知识引导的弱监督模型，通过将结构化领域知识整合到神经网络架构中，在共享嵌入空间中对齐规则和数据样本，从而改进医疗欺诈检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗欺诈检测面临标记数据稀缺、欺诈手段不断演变和医疗记录高维度等挑战。传统监督方法受限于极端标签稀缺，而纯无监督方法往往无法捕捉临床意义的异常。

Method: 通过在共享嵌入空间中联合训练编码器，将领域专业知识整合到神经网络架构中，学习软规则嵌入，使数据驱动学习能够通过领域知识约束得到增强。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，CleverCatch优于四种最先进的异常检测基线方法，AUC平均提高1.3%，召回率平均提高3.4%。

Conclusion: 将专家规则嵌入学习过程不仅能提高检测准确性，还能增加透明度，为医疗欺诈检测等高风险领域提供可解释的方法。

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

TL;DR: 比较Ising({-1,+1})和QUBO({0,1})编码在玻尔兹曼机学习中的表现，发现QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数更差，在随机梯度下降中收敛更慢，而自然梯度下降对编码选择不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同变量编码（Ising vs QUBO）如何影响玻尔兹曼机学习的信息几何和收敛性能，为实际应用提供编码选择指导。

Method: 在固定模型、采样器和步长的控制协议下，通过分析Fisher信息矩阵的特征值和谱熵，比较两种编码的收敛特性。

Result: QUBO编码产生更多小特征值方向，Fisher信息矩阵条件数更差，导致随机梯度下降收敛更慢；自然梯度下降对编码选择不敏感。

Conclusion: 对于基于随机梯度下降的训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO编码，中心化/缩放或自然梯度下降预条件可以缓解曲率问题。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于截断影响函数(TIF)的偏好数据质量评估方法，发现数据质量是模型相关的，并开发了两种简化的评分函数来改进偏好数据选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM来预处理原始训练数据集以识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。

Method: 提出截断影响函数(TIF)来评估数据质量，开发两种计算更简单的评分函数(SF)，并通过组合它们来抵消不同的误差源。

Result: 实验表明，使用更少的数据可以实现更好的对齐性能，证明了所提方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的，需要针对特定模型改进数据选择方法，提出的数据选择规则能够更精确地选择有价值的偏好数据。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

Motivation: 现有的大规模环境并行化方法虽然能加速训练时间，但仍需要大量环境交互才能达到理想性能。结构良好的表示可以改善深度强化学习的泛化能力和样本效率。

Method: 提出单纯形嵌入：轻量级表示层，将嵌入约束到单纯形结构中，产生稀疏离散特征来稳定critic引导和增强策略梯度。

Result: 在FastTD3、FastSAC和PPO算法上应用单纯形嵌入，在多种连续和离散控制环境中一致提高了样本效率和最终性能，且没有损失运行速度。

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入通过几何归纳偏置提供了有效的表示学习方法，能够显著提升强化学习算法的性能而不增加计算开销。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Result: 广泛的实验表明，FracNet相比最先进方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: FracNet通过频谱分析和对比学习的结合，有效解决了图神经网络在领域自适应中的挑战，并提供了严格的理论证明。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 解决现实环境中多模态数据异构性挑战，现有联邦学习框架在非理想设置下效果有限，无法处理客户端间模态和样本分布不对称的情况。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有巨大潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等需要数据隐私保护的现实场景。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定、手动调整的干预强度，容易导致干预不足或过度，需要更智能的干预机制。

Method: 通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，在无法自信修正时选择弃权，可应用于现有干预技术之上。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型家族上的实验表明，MERA能安全有效地纠正错误且不降低性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MERA是一个通用且高效的机制激活干预方法，可提升现有干预技术的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准共形预测假设i.i.d.数据，但在联邦学习场景中客户端数据分布差异很大，现有联邦CP方法只能保证边际覆盖，无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 使用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据，让每个客户端本地校准反映其独特不确定性的共形分数，通过联邦聚合保持全局一致性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Fed-CCP能够实现更自适应的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP通过生成模型有效解决了联邦学习中数据异构性带来的条件覆盖问题，为高风险联邦学习场景提供了更好的不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

TL;DR: RockNet是一种专为超低功耗硬件设计的TinyML方法，通过分布式学习和无线通信集成，在时间序列分类任务中实现最先进精度，无需离线预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在信息物理系统中的重要性增加，需要从云端训练转向设备端处理（TinyML），但由于超低功耗微控制器的有限计算资源，训练变得困难。

Method: 利用CPS由多个设备组成的特点，设计分布式学习方法，集成机器学习和无线通信，使用专门的计算高效分类器进行分布式训练，最小化通信开销。

Result: 在20个超低功耗设备的测试平台上，RockNet成功从零开始学习时间序列分类任务，比最新的神经网络微控制器训练方法准确率提高达2倍，分布式架构在扩展到20个设备时，每个设备的内存、延迟和能耗降低达90%。

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次实现了在超低功耗硬件上以最先进精度进行训练。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: 算法决策日益普及但易受战略性操纵，已有研究表明分类器弃权能提高准确性，本文旨在探索弃权在战略性分类环境中的作用。

Method: 使用Stackelberg博弈模型，决策者作为领导者首先宣布决策策略，战略性代理人作为跟随者操纵特征以获得期望结果，重点关注二元分类器。

Result: 最优弃权策略确保决策者效用不劣于非弃权设置，弃权还能作为操纵威慑，使资质较差的代理人更难通过操纵获得正面结果。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中战略性行为负面影响的有价值工具，既能提高准确性又能抑制操纵。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Conclusion: 提出的变分Thompson采样方法在理论上具有强保证，实践表明通过仔细调整后验最大概率原则，能有效提升贝叶斯优化在离散空间的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 邻近核方法能有效处理不完整数据的相似度计算问题，避免信息丢失和偏差，在实际应用中具有良好性能。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Generalist框架，通过将泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个基础学习器专注于特定目标，后期参数插值形成全局学习器，缓解对抗训练中的自然精度下降和鲁棒性跨攻击迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练存在两个主要局限性：自然精度显著下降，以及在不同范数约束攻击下的鲁棒性迁移能力差。

Method: 将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个基础学习器专注于特定目标，后期通过参数插值形成全局学习器，并定期将全局参数重新分配给基础学习器。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，显著缓解了权衡问题。

Conclusion: Generalist为开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，在复杂环境中表现出强适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

Conclusion: 该预测市场框架能够有效促进利益相关者间的协作，同时处理数据所有权和竞争利益问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络(GNN)的方法来近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，相比传统精确计算和蒙特卡洛采样方法，实现了数量级的速度提升和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值计算在多智能体系统中至关重要，但精确计算在超过约20个智能体时因指数复杂度而不可行，蒙特卡洛方法又存在高样本复杂性和无法跨网络配置迁移知识的问题。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用图神经网络(GNN)直接从网络拓扑和控制结构中学习智能体影响力的通用模式，比较了三种最先进的GNN架构：图注意力网络(GAT)、带边特征的图同构网络(GINE)和EdgeConv。

Result: 在包含20万张图的大规模合成数据集上验证，训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法实现了数量级的速度提升，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了GNN作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具，能够准确预测具有不同结构特性的全新网络的Banzhaf值，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

TL;DR: 提出一个假设宽松的框架，用于评估生存分析中条件平均治疗效应(CATE)估计在面临删失偏差时的稳健性，通过部分识别推导CATE的信息边界，并开发具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的新型元学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床研究中高达一半的患者因副作用或其他原因提前退出，当退出是信息性时（即依赖于生存时间），会引入删失偏差，导致治疗效应估计出现偏差。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界，开发新型元学习器，利用任意机器学习模型估计边界，具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的理论特性。

Result: 通过数值实验和癌症药物试验应用证明了元学习器的实际价值，能够识别在信息性删失下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估删失存在下估计治疗效应的稳健性提供了实用工具，促进了生存数据在医学和流行病学中证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性下降和应用卸载率上升。现有工业实践存在特征冗余和存储稀疏问题。

Method: 1. 将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大加权匹配问题，提出分层算法；2. 使用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量日志文件中；3. 设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式。

Result: 在真实用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%至44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为更广泛采用设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础，有效解决了移动应用中用户行为日志的存储瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

Conclusion: Procrustes后处理是一种简单有效的嵌入对齐方法，能够使不同嵌入模型互操作，同时保持各自的几何特性，解决了实际应用中的互操作性挑战。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Mamdani系统可解释性和TSK模型精度的新型模糊回归方法，通过混合规则结构和双支配类型，在保持可解释性的同时提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归方法难以处理现实世界数据中的不确定性和模糊性，而深度学习缺乏可解释性且在小数据集上容易过拟合。模糊系统虽然能处理不确定性，但Mamdani和TSK系统在可解释性和精度之间存在权衡。

Method: 开发了一种混合模糊回归方法，结合了Mamdani系统的可解释性和TSK模型的精度，采用包含模糊和清晰组件的混合规则结构以及双支配类型。

Result: 在6个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法在4个数据集中获得了最佳的模糊方法得分，在2个数据集中优于不透明模型，在1个数据集中获得最佳总体得分，RMSE改进范围从0.4%到19%。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，有效解决了模糊系统中可解释性与精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督的低秩方法来校正停车位GPS点的误差，并将其与道路对齐，解决了高层建筑导致的GPS漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 停车位的准确GPS位置对城市管理和规划至关重要，但高层建筑和低成本GPS设备会导致位置误差，需要一种无监督的方法来校正大量停车位中的错误GPS点。

Method: 利用停车位与道路平行的物理约束，提出无监督低秩方法，在统一框架中同时进行GPS点误差校正和对齐。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法能有效解决实际问题，对任何类型的GPS点误差都简单有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为停车位GPS点校正提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

TL;DR: 提出首个学习增强的Sum of Squares（SOS）认证算法，使用Transformer预测最小单项式基，大幅减少SDP规模，实现100倍以上加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项式非负性认证是NP难问题，传统SOS认证需要求解维度随单项式基大小二次增长的SDP，计算成本高昂。

Method: 训练Transformer模型预测几乎最小的单项式基，包含高效生成1亿+SOS多项式训练数据、Transformer架构设计与训练、理论分析的回退机制。

Result: 在200多个基准数据集上验证，相比最先进求解器实现100倍以上加速，能解决竞争方法失败的实例。

Conclusion: 该方法为SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新的见解和突破。

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测概率的校准对于可靠的机器学习至关重要，但标准训练程序如何产生良好校准的模型尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 基于优化误差、正则化强度和Rademacher复杂度建立了平滑校准误差的有限样本泛化界，并在再生核希尔伯特空间中实例化了该理论。

Result: 实验验证了理论保证，表明L2正则化ERM可以提供良好校准的模型，无需提升或后处理重新校准。

Conclusion: 标准L2正则化经验风险最小化本身就能提供良好的概率校准，无需额外的校准技术。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

Motivation: 平均收益最优性在MDP中过于渐近，需要结合即时损失度量来考虑偏差最优性层次结构，以识别具有不同最优性阶数的策略。

Method: 为每个最优性阶数构建学习算法，并开发可触发有限时间停止的停止规则，特别针对具有唯一Bellman最优策略的MDP类别。

Result: 算法具有渐近消失的错误概率，确定了能在有限时间内停止识别的MDP类别（具有唯一Bellman最优策略），并提供了可实际应用的停止规则。

Conclusion: 成功解决了偏差最优性层次结构的策略识别问题，为具有唯一Bellman最优策略的MDP提供了有限时间停止的可行方法。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法仅依赖单模态EEG信号，忽略了多模态信息的潜在优势。

Method: 基于CLIP框架，使用Conformer架构的EEG编码器和Learnable BERT文本编码器，在共享潜在空间进行跨模态表示学习，并通过知识蒸馏训练轻量学生模型。

Result: 在TUSZ、AUBMC和CHB-MIT数据集上，师生模型准确率均超过97%，F1分数均高于0.94，学生模型参数约为教师模型的58.1%。

Conclusion: 该模型在EEG癫痫检测中表现出强大潜力，为资源受限环境部署轻量模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了移动设备上LoRA适配器的在线持续合并问题，在资源受限环境下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展传统在线凸优化(OCO)框架，考虑多目标场景，其中存在K个不同的损失函数序列。传统OCO只关注单一损失序列，而实际应用中可能需要同时跟踪多个目标，因此需要研究如何在这些目标之间进行权衡。

Method: 在i.i.d.输入设置下，提出了结合Hedge算法和在线梯度下降(OGD)的简单算法。Hedge用于处理多个损失序列的权衡，OGD用于在线凸优化更新。

Result: 通过简洁的证明，展示了该算法的期望最小最大遗憾为O(√(T log K))，其中T是时间范围，K是损失序列数量。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够有效解决多目标在线凸优化问题，在i.i.d.设置下实现了次线性遗憾界，为多目标在线学习提供了理论保证。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across

previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges

introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试容易受到语义等效对抗扰动的影响，但现有研究主要关注对所有模型产生同等影响的攻击，缺乏对选择性攻击（即只针对特定模型性能）的研究。

Method: 使用TextAttack框架中的经典攻击方法，开发选择性评估协议，创建自定义约束来提高攻击选择性，并提出了基于代理LLM的选择性扰动生成流程。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM评估中需要采用扰动感知的报告和鲁棒性诊断，以增强基准测试的公平性和可复现性。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

Result: 在CNN基DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数比仅使用原始数据集提高0.16。在DTCO背景下，ArtNet生成的mini-brains与目标全规模块设计的设计指标匹配度达97.94%。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成逼真的人工数据集，实现了更高效的PPA优化和设计流程探索，解决了ML和DTCO中的数据稀缺和周转时间长的问题。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

*Chen Wang,Yansen Wang,Dongqi Han,Zilong Wang,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EEGChaT，一种基于Transformer的通道选择模块，用于自动识别SEEG记录中最具任务相关性的通道，通过通道聚合令牌和改进的注意力展开技术计算可解释的通道重要性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG信号分析对脑机接口和神经科学研究至关重要，但由于输入通道数量大且相关性异质，传统通道选择方法难以扩展或提供有意义的可解释性。

Method: EEGChaT引入通道聚合令牌(CATs)来聚合跨通道信息，并利用改进的注意力展开技术计算可量化的通道重要性分数。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上的评估显示，EEGChaT与现有分类模型集成能持续提高解码准确率，实现高达17%的绝对增益，且产生的通道权重与手动选择的通道有显著重叠。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是高维SEEG分析中有效且可泛化的通道选择解决方案，既提升了性能又提供了对神经信号相关性的洞察。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Motivation: 现代传感和成像技术产生了高维时空数据，但有效建模面临挑战：不规则空间结构、快速时间动态以及多变量联合预测需求。

Method: 开发几何感知的多任务高斯过程模型捕捉时空结构和任务间依赖关系，并通过物理规律正则化方案增强模型保真度和鲁棒性。

Result: 在3D心脏电动力学建模任务中验证，数值实验显示该方法通过有效整合领域特定物理约束和几何先验，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: P-M-GP框架成功结合了数据驱动建模和物理约束，为复杂时空动态系统提供了准确可靠的建模方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中由于隐私法规和安全要求，需要能够有效且及时地移除特定客户端对模型的贡献，现有方法需要多轮通信导致模型在删除过程中不可用。

Method: 使用任务算术和神经正切核技术，实现快速移除客户端对模型的影响。

Result: 该方法能够快速完成知识删除，减少通信轮次，提高模型可用性。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案能够满足联邦学习中数据删除的时效性要求，为用户提供更好的服务体验。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN架构在表达能力上有限，而更强大的架构通常计算成本高昂。本文旨在开发既具有更强表达能力又保持计算效率的GNN架构。

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，在消息传递中显式使用三角形信息，提出EB-1WL测试和对应的EB-GNN架构。

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL表达能力显著更强，提供了完整的一阶逻辑特征描述；EB-GNN在保持近线性计算复杂度的同时，性能优于简单MPNN，与专用GNN竞争且更高效。

Conclusion: EB-GNN是一个高效通用的GNN架构，在表达能力和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，为图学习任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more
computationally efficient.

*Riddhish Thakare,Kingdom Mutala Akugri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文为经典非线性降维方法构建了神经解码器框架，实现了双向映射，并探索了在降维流形空间中的扩散生成过程，但发现这些方法在生成质量上不如端到端优化的自编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典非线性降维技术如t-SNE、Isomap和LLE虽然擅长数据可视化，但缺乏将低维嵌入映射回原始高维空间的能力，这限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一个系统化框架来为主要的NLDR方法构建神经解码器架构，实现了双向映射，并扩展了基于扩散的生成过程，直接在学习的流形空间中进行操作。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的实验表明，解码器虽然能成功重建数据，但质量不如端到端优化的自编码器；流形约束的扩散生成产生低质量样本，表明经典NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型所需的连续插值。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了为主要用于可视化和分析而设计的NLDR方法添加生成能力所面临的固有挑战。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于门电路的量子储层计算(MTS-QRC)用于多元时间序列预测，该方法针对当前量子硬件限制进行优化，在噪声环境中表现良好，甚至在某些情况下优于无噪声模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子储层计算大多针对单变量信号，且忽略了近期量子硬件的实际约束，需要开发适合多元时间序列预测且适应NISQ硬件限制的量子储层计算方法。

Method: 使用注入和记忆量子比特配对，采用针对当前设备连接性和深度优化的Trotter化最近邻横向场Ising演化，构建门电路量子储层计算框架。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上分别获得0.0087和0.0036的均方误差，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些情况下优于学习型RNN；在IBM Heron R2上保持精度，奇异值分析显示设备噪声可作为隐式正则化器。

Conclusion: 基于门电路的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上具有实际应用价值，硬件噪声在某些情况下可能对线性读出有益，值得系统研究噪声何时以及如何有益于量子储层计算。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的出现，需要评估其零样本预测能力，但现有评估方法存在数据完整性、信息泄露和基准数据集代表性等问题，可能影响性能评估的准确性。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估方法，识别出多个挑战，包括数据集代表性、时空评估缺失、信息泄露风险和外部冲击导致的模式记忆问题。

Result: 研究发现现有评估存在广泛的数据划分混淆问题，可能导致性能估计膨胀和全局知识错误传递到局部时间序列。

Conclusion: 需要开发稳健的评估方法，避免在LLM和经典时间序列基准测试中已观察到的陷阱，并呼吁研究社区设计新的原则性方法，如基于真正样本外未来数据的评估，以确保TSFM评估的完整性。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

<details>

Motivation: 类别不平衡问题导致分类器偏向多数类，现有方法仅使用多数类分布来近似少数类统计会产生过泛化问题。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络保持不平衡数据结构，通过加权多数类和中间类的高斯混合成分来校准少数类分布参数，生成合成样本。

Result: 在多种图像、文本和表格数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线方法和最先进技术取得了更优越的分类性能。

Conclusion: RCS方法通过分布校准策略有效解决了类别不平衡问题，避免了过泛化，在多个领域数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Method: 基于参数共享结构（如Deep Sets和图神经网络）提出轴向神经网络XNN，将现有PDE基础模型转换为XNN架构。

Result: XNN在三种训练场景下表现与原模型相当，并在未见维度上展现更优泛化能力。

Conclusion: XNN能有效处理维度变化问题，多维预训练对基础模型很重要。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Motivation: 对角预条件器作为二阶优化器的近似计算可行方法，在深度学习模型训练中显示出加速潜力。需要比较基于Adam和Gauss-Newton这两种主流方法的性能差异。

Method: 通过两个关键因素分析：预条件器的基选择和梯度噪声影响。在二次目标和逻辑回归下分析所有四种情况，包括理论分析和实证研究。

Result: 无论基选择如何，在全批次设置下存在Adam优于GN^{-1}和GN^{-1/2}的情况。在随机设置下，对于高斯数据假设的线性回归，Adam与GN^{-1/2}行为相似。

Conclusion: Adam和Gauss-Newton对角预条件方法在不同设置下各有优势，理论结果在凸和非凸目标上得到实证支持。

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: 提出的InfoRM、IBL和MOP框架共同推进了RLHF技术，为解决奖励过优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法依赖贪心启发式算法，忽略了权重间的相互作用，导致剪枝效果不理想。由于寻找最优剪枝掩码是一个难解的组合问题，需要更有效的优化方法。

Method: 使用凸松弛技术将组合约束转化为可优化问题，采用Frank-Wolfe算法求解，最终通过舍入获得整数解。该方法避免了完整重训练，仅需小型校准数据集。

Result: 该方法显著减少了逐层剪枝误差，在先进的GPT架构上优于强基线方法，同时保持内存效率。

Conclusion: Frank-Wolfe算法结合凸松弛为LLM剪枝提供了理论保证的近似最优解，有效解决了传统贪心方法的局限性。

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

Motivation: 千米尺度天气数据对实际应用至关重要，但传统天气模拟计算量大。深度学习模型提供了更快的替代方案，但其可靠性仍受质疑，因为评估通常使用标准机器学习指标而非大气物理学的见解。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在千米尺度天气降尺度中存在地理泛化和物理一致性挑战，功率谱密度损失函数可作为一种初步解决方案来改进小尺度物理结构的重建。

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于块马尔可夫决策过程(BMDPs)的两阶段强化学习算法，通过聚类学习潜在状态结构，显著提高了学习效率，将遗憾从O(√T+n²)改进到O(√T+n)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维状态和动作空间使强化学习在许多实际应用中不可行，但许多环境具有可利用的结构。BMDPs建模了具有大观测空间但由潜在状态决定动态的问题，需要开发能有效利用这种结构的学习算法。

Result: 算法在可聚类的BMDPs类上实现了O(√T+n)的遗憾，优于先前最好的O(√T+n²)界限，特别是当观测空间基数n很大时。证明在该类BMDPs上无法获得更低的遗憾，表明算法达到了渐近最优性。

Conclusion: 准确的潜在状态估计能有效加速强化学习，所提出的两阶段算法在可聚类的BMDPs类上达到了渐近最优的遗憾界限，为高维强化学习问题提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL在训练大语言模型中变得至关重要，但缺乏像预训练那样可预测的计算扩展方法，无法评估算法改进对RL计算扩展的影响。

Method: 进行了超过40万GPU小时的大规模系统研究，拟合RL训练的S形计算-性能曲线，分析了各种常见设计选择对渐近性能和计算效率的影响。

Result: 发现：(1)不同配方的渐近性能不同；(2)损失聚合、归一化等细节主要影响计算效率而非渐近性能；(3)稳定可扩展的配方遵循可预测的扩展轨迹。基于此提出了ScaleRL最佳实践配方。

Conclusion: 该研究为分析RL扩展提供了科学框架，使RL训练更接近预训练的可预测性，成功预测了10万GPU小时规模下的验证性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.
