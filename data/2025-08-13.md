Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI框架通过结合分子图像信息和功能基序序列，提升了药物相互作用预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多药同时使用可能引发不良反应，现有方法因局限于功能基序表示学习而表现不足。

Method: ImageDDI将药物分子分解为功能基序，结合全局分子图像信息，使用Transformer编码器和自适应特征融合。

Result: ImageDDI在多个数据集上优于现有方法，且在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过融合局部和全局结构信息，显著提升了药物相互作用预测的性能。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备数量激增，但资源有限，难以运行深度学习模型，因此需要优化技术以实现高效边缘计算。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的管道，通过神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD）提升混合光学神经网络的性能，解决了训练精度差距和仿真与实现差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但存在训练精度差距和仿真与实现差异的限制。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的管道，结合NTKD技术，在训练前估计模型精度，训练中对齐光学模型与电子教师网络，实现后微调数字后端。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证，管道显著提升ONN性能，支持仿真和实际部署。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ONNs的精度和实现问题，推动了其实际应用。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频叙事，通过分阶段智能体协作和3E原则优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量低和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: MAViS采用多智能体协作框架，分阶段处理脚本编写、镜头设计等任务，并遵循3E原则（探索、检查、增强）。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上达到最优性能，并能生成多模态设计输出。

Conclusion: MAViS是首个支持多模态设计输出的框架，显著提升了长序列视频生成的质量和创造力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装扩散框架，通过联合建模上下服装和人物身份，解决了现有虚拟试穿方法在保留身份和服装保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖复杂预处理，且难以保留人物特定特征（如纹身、配饰、体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：GRM（服装语义捕捉）、PRM（身份和姿态编码）、A-DiT（扩散变换器融合服装、人物和文本提示特征），支持基于提示的细粒度定制。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试穿提供了更真实、灵活的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CObL的扩散架构，用于从图像中推断出由遮挡有序的对象层组成的场景表示，并展示了其在真实世界照片上的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为对象并理解其空间关系（包括遮挡关系）。为此，论文提出了一种新的场景表示方法，即由遮挡有序的对象层组成的堆栈。

Method: 采用扩散模型（CObL）并行生成对象层，利用Stable Diffusion作为自然对象的先验，并通过推理时指导确保层复合回输入图像。训练数据为合成的多对象桌面场景图像。

Result: CObL在未经训练的真实世界桌面照片上表现出零样本泛化能力，能够重建多个遮挡对象而无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无需监督的情况下学习对象中心表示，且不局限于训练环境，优于现有的模态完成和无监督对象表示学习模型。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在序列视觉叙事处理中存在表面识别与深层叙事推理的差距。研究发现，尽管大型多模态模型擅长单幅画面解读，但在时间因果性和跨画面连贯性上表现不佳。研究提出了一种新的评估框架，结合多模态标注和跨模态嵌入分析，揭示了VLMs的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前VLMs在长叙事理解中的不足，特别是在时间因果性和跨画面连贯性方面的缺陷，为提升多模态模型的叙事智能提供基础。

Method: 研究采用多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估，结合Re:Zero漫画的308个标注画面，从生成叙事、上下文对话基础和时间推理三个维度系统评估VLMs。

Result: 当前模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长序列因果推理方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为评估叙事智能提供了方法论基础，并指出了多模态模型在深层序列理解上的改进方向。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需侵入模型内部，适用于各种VLM服务模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，而基于激活的向量需要访问模型内部，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。

Method: VISOR通过生成诱导目标激活模式的通用转向图像，仅依赖视觉输入实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可实现显著行为偏移（高达25%）。

Conclusion: VISOR提供了一种高效、隐蔽的行为控制方法，同时揭示了视觉通道的安全漏洞，呼吁开发针对视觉转向攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过使用平行文本行图像（原始近代日语文本与现代日语字体配对）来增强OCR训练数据集，解决了近代日语文献转录中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日语文献具有重要历史价值，但转录工作耗时且标注数据有限，阻碍了OCR系统的训练。

Method: 提出了一种基于距离的目标函数，最小化平行图像对的自注意力特征差距，探索了欧几里得距离和最大均值差异（MMD）作为领域适应度量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在使用欧几里得距离和MMD时，分别将字符错误率（CER）降低了2.23%和3.94%。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了自注意力表征的判别质量，从而提升了历史文献OCR的有效性。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn是一种自适应、实例级的温度校准方法，显著降低ViT的校准误差，且不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，但现有方法（如全局温度缩放）需要验证集且不够灵活。

Method: 提出Calibration Attention (CalAttn)，通过ViT的CLS令牌学习每个实例的自适应温度。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且仅增加0.1%参数。学习到的温度值集中在1.0附近。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于多种架构，提供更可信的概率校准，同时保持准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架DTLP-Net，通过多样化的教师模型和标签传播技术，解决了医学图像分割中的标注不足和领域偏移问题，显著提升了半监督学习任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注不足和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务设计，导致未标注数据利用不足和性能受限。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net框架，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化教师模型，通过解耦训练和动量更新生成可靠伪标签，并结合数据增强和标签传播技术。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在SSMIS、UMDA和Semi-MDG任务中均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架具有通用性和高效性，能够应对更复杂的半监督学习场景。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FLIPNET的统一网络，通过切换两种模式（修复模式和退化模式）来解决盲人脸恢复（BFR）中的关键问题，显著提升了真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型与BFR之间存在差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像的差异以及合成与真实世界图像的差异。FLIPNET旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FLIPNET通过两种模式工作：修复模式逐步整合BFR特征和面部嵌入以实现真实恢复；退化模式基于真实世界退化数据合成类似退化的图像。

Result: 实验表明，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有基于扩散先验的BFR方法，且在模拟真实世界退化方面优于传统退化模型。

Conclusion: FLIPNET通过双模式设计有效解决了BFR中的关键问题，为盲人脸恢复提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

TL;DR: 论文提出AutoSAME框架，结合SAM的视觉理解能力，同时完成分割和关键点定位任务，优化左心室指标测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在小训练数据集下难以捕捉通用视觉表示，且SAM等视觉基础模型虽擅长分割但无法识别关键解剖点。

Method: 提出AutoSAME框架，结合SAM的分割能力和关键点定位任务；引入FCBA和SGPA优化特征学习和空间引导。

Result: 实验证明AutoSAME在左心室分割、关键点定位和指标测量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割与关键点定位，实现了符合临床指南的左心室指标测量。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法无法独立控制视频的关键元素（前景、背景、轨迹和动作），限制了视频生成的灵活性。

Method: 构建3D坐标系进行运动编辑，通过2D轨迹反投影和动作库实现控制，结合扩散变换模型生成视频。

Result: 在基准数据集和实际案例中，方法在可控性和视频质量上达到最优。

Conclusion: 框架实现了灵活的视频元素组合，生成高质量且可控的视频。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Conclusion: 强化学习是提升多模态大语言模型在文档理解中可解释性和适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

TL;DR: QueryCraft通过引入语义先验和引导特征学习，改进了基于DETR的HOI检测方法，提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DETR-based方法在HOI检测中因查询初始化缺乏明确语义而性能不佳。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，结合ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器）生成语义明确的查询。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义引导的查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测效果。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型规模和复杂度的增加，微调成本高昂，需要一种高效的方法将‘弱’模型的适应知识迁移到‘强’模型。

Method: 提出TransMiter，通过无监督方式捕捉预训练与微调模型间的知识差距，无需反向传播即可跨模型迁移知识。

Result: 实验表明，TransMiter能高效迁移适应知识，保持泛化能力，且额外推理成本极低。

Conclusion: TransMiter为视觉语言模型的适应知识迁移提供了一种高效、轻量的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Result: HVPL模型在避免灾难性遗忘方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL通过分层提示学习有效解决了VIS中的类别固定和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME作为一种即插即用模块，无需修改主干架构即可提升视觉-语言知识蒸馏的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态医学图像融合方法MMIF-AMIN，通过可逆密集网络和多尺度互补特征提取模块，结合自适应损失函数，显著提升了融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态医学图像融合（MMIF）旨在整合不同模态的图像以提供更全面的诊断信息，但如何同时捕获独特和互补信息是关键挑战。

Method: 采用可逆密集网络（IDN）进行无损特征提取，设计多尺度互补特征提取模块（MCFEM）结合混合注意力机制和Transformer，并引入自适应损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，MMIF-AMIN在定量和定性分析中均优于九种现有方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN不仅在医学图像融合中表现优异，还可扩展到其他图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

*Yimeng Geng,Mingyang Zhao,Fan Xu,Guanglin Cao,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PADReg提出了一种基于接触力的物理感知可变形配准框架，用于超声图像配准，显著提升了配准精度和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像配准在捕捉生物力学特性和提高诊断准确性方面至关重要，但由于图像低对比度、噪声和模糊组织边界，现有方法难以实现可靠的特征提取和配准。

Method: PADReg利用机器人超声系统测量的接触力作为物理先验，构建像素级刚度图，结合力数据通过轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 实验表明，PADReg的HD95为12.90，比现有方法提升了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理先验，实现了更准确的解剖对齐和物理合理的配准。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，通过预训练的Vision Transformer和轻量级解码器，显著提高了精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野自由空间检测因可通行区域边界模糊而更具挑战性，现有方法依赖多模态融合（RGB和LiDAR），但计算量大，无法满足实时性需求。

Method: 采用预训练的Vision Transformer提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量级解码器，避免使用LiDAR数据。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新的SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS，显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: ROD证明了仅用RGB数据即可高效实现越野自由空间检测，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无参考视频质量评估方法CBAND，用于解决高压缩视频中的条带伪影问题，并发布了首个公开的视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高压缩视频中的条带伪影严重影响感知质量，现有数据集仅针对静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态。

Method: 创建了包含160个视频的LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，提出基于深度神经网络嵌入的无参考评估方法CBAND。

Result: CBAND在条带伪影预测性能上显著优于现有方法，且速度更快，还可作为可微损失函数优化视频去条带模型。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频条带伪影研究提供了有效工具，推动了视频质量评估的发展。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了罕见案例的错误，提升了模型鲁棒性且未引入新错误。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习模型的系统性错误修复提供了一种有效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

*Zunjie Xiao,Xiao Wu,Tianhang Liu,Lingxi Hu,Yinling Zhang,Xiaoqing Zhang,Risa Higashita,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信度损失（ACW）和边界预期校准误差（BECE）指标，用于提升眼科镜头结构分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分割网络对所有像素平等加权，忽略了镜头结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。专家标注时对不同子区域的置信度有差异，因此需要利用这种先验信息。

Method: ACW损失通过置信度阈值将镜头结构子区域分为高低置信度组，并应用区域加权损失。同时设计了自适应置信度阈值优化算法和BECE指标。

Result: 在临床AS-OCT数据集上，ACW显著优于其他分割损失方法，如IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW损失和BECE指标有效提升了镜头结构分割的精度和校准性能。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available
at https://github.com/XiaoLing12138/Adaptive-Confidence-Wise-Loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交网络视频共享管道的框架，用于生成压缩和调整大小的参数，以改进深度伪造检测器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络上的AI生成视频对深度伪造检测提出新挑战，现有检测器在真实场景中泛化能力不足，主要原因是平台专有压缩破坏了低级取证线索。

Method: 通过从少量上传视频中估计压缩和调整大小参数，构建本地模拟器，无需直接API访问即可大规模重现平台特定伪影。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，且基于模拟视频微调的检测器性能接近实际共享媒体训练的检测器。

Conclusion: 该方法为实验室训练与真实世界部署之间的差距提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，尤其在压缩视频内容领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新基准，用于评估系统在复杂场景中通过自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力，包含大量场景和查询数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统适用于简单场景，但现实场景更复杂，需要从模糊描述中识别物体。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域检索对应的3D模型，包含1600多个公寓场景和44000多个查询。

Result: 粗粒度检索已解决，但仅一个模型在几乎所有测试中表现最佳；轻量级CLIP模型表现良好，但在细节上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为提升真实世界3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物姿态估计因物种形态多样性和数据稀缺而更具挑战性，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优异，尤其在物种多样、背景复杂和关键点缺失的场景中。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过生成式框架和语义引导，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，导致视频质量下降，且增加的比特率缺乏优化分配方法。

Method: 利用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配。

Result: 实验证明，该模型在定性和定量上均有效。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp成功实现了感知增强和比特率节省的双重目标。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在ZJU-MoCap和MonoCap数据集上，MonoPartNeRF在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF通过改进的变形和姿态建模，实现了更自然的边界过渡和更准确的遮挡恢复。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Result: 生成了一个公开数据集，可用于跨年龄人脸识别和合成图像检测的基准测试。

Conclusion: 该方法简单实用，能有效编辑年龄并保留身份，为相关领域提供了新工具和数据集。

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式有效解决了类别与特征不对齐问题，显著提升了轻量级语义分割模型的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Conclusion: TARA为多概念文本到图像生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and

### [43] [3DFroMLLM: 3D Prototype Generation only from Pretrained Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08821)
*Noor Ahmed,Cameron Braunstein,Steffen Eger,Eddy Ilg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DFroMLLM是一个新框架，能够直接从多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成3D对象原型，包括几何和部件标签，无需额外训练数据或详细用户指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs的空间推理能力有限，需要改进。

Method: 采用代理式流程，包括设计师、编码员和视觉检查员，通过细化循环生成3D原型。

Result: 生成的渲染图像在图像分类预训练任务中表现优于先前方法15%，并显著提升细粒度视觉语言模型的性能（55%准确率提升）。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM展示了无需额外数据即可显著提升MLLMs空间推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [44] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向性图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）新框架，通过定义各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）度量，优化参数后能高效评估图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无参考图像质量评估中如何准确分类和量化图像退化的问题。

Method: 使用两阶段系统：首先通过两种ATR配置分类主要退化类型（模糊或噪声），然后用回归模型量化退化程度。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关系数分别达到-0.93和-0.95，分类准确率超过97%，整体预测R2为0.892。

Conclusion: 该框架是一种高效的双用途工具，可用于图像退化的分类和量化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于学习的自适应高频预处理框架，优化视频编码中的主观质量与比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码比特率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用频率注意力特征金字塔预测网络（FFPN）预测最优高频预处理策略，指导后续滤波操作，平衡比特率与压缩后质量。

Result: 在多数据集上的综合评估显示，该框架能显著提升视觉质量并节省比特率。

Conclusion: 该框架在视频编码中实现了主观质量与比特率的优化平衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate在动态场景渲染中表现出色，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Result: MaskClu在多个3D任务（如部分分割、语义分割、目标检测和分类）中取得了新的竞争性结果。

Conclusion: MaskClu通过联合优化密集语义重建和实例级对比学习，使ViTs能够从3D点云中学习更丰富且语义更有意义的表示。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管术前数据的自动肿瘤分割和报告生成已有进展，但术后影像分析仍缺乏关注。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提升术后评估和临床决策的效率。

Method: 使用Attention U-Net训练分割模型（术前肿瘤核心、术后残留肿瘤和切除腔），并用DenseNet进行MR序列分类和肿瘤类型识别。流程遵循RANO 2.0指南，基于多中心数据集（2000-7000例患者）进行5折交叉验证。

Conclusion: 该流程实现了术后影像的自动化分析和标准化报告生成，整合至开源平台Raidionics，显著提升了术后评估的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于交叉视图网络和新型融合范式的LiDAR地点识别方法，通过伪全局信息引导和多模态分支协调，结合流形适应和成对方差-局部性学习度量，显著提升了复杂环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR地点识别方法依赖欧氏距离度量学习，忽略了特征空间的内在结构和类内方差，导致在复杂环境和时变场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种交叉视图网络，引入伪全局信息引导机制和多模态分支协调，同时设计了流形适应和成对方差-局部性学习度量，使用SPD矩阵计算马氏距离。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂环境条件下表现优异，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过几何化建模和流形适应，新方法能够更准确地捕捉数据分布和类间依赖关系，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Motivation: 体数据压缩在医学影像、科学模拟和娱乐等领域至关重要，需要高效且无结构的解决方案。

Method: 采用动态体素选择和形态学膨胀技术，优先处理活跃区域，减少冗余计算。

Result: 训练时间减少63.7%，压缩率为14，仅轻微影响质量（PSNR下降0.59 dB，SSIM下降0.008）。

Conclusion: 该方法为体数据压缩提供了高效、可扩展的无结构解决方案。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种零样本方法，利用CLIP模型无需微调即可检测面部变形攻击（MAD），通过设计并聚合多文本提示提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部变形攻击（MAD）威胁人脸识别安全，现有方法多依赖微调，忽略了基础模型（如CLIP）的直接通用潜力。

Method: 利用CLIP模型，设计并聚合多个文本提示，无需额外训练或微调，直接用于MAD任务。

Result: 提示聚合显著提升了零样本检测性能，验证了通过高效提示工程利用基础模型内置多模态知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过零样本方法和提示聚合，CLIP模型可直接用于MAD任务，展示了基础模型在生物识别中的通用潜力。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Conclusion: 轻量化模型在准确性和效率上取得优越平衡。

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Result: Lay2Story在一致性、语义相关性和美学质量上优于现有技术，达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 布局条件能有效提升故事生成任务的性能，Lay2Story框架为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的文本条件状态空间模型（TCSSM），用于解决变化检测视觉问答（CDVQA）中的域偏移问题，并引入了一个多模态多域数据集BrightVQA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变化检测方法需要专家知识，且现有CDVQA方法假设训练和测试数据分布相似，但实际应用中常存在域偏移。

Method: 提出TCSSM模型，结合双时相图像和地理灾害相关文本信息，提取跨域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明TCSSM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSSM和BrightVQA数据集为CDVQA的域泛化研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性。

Method: 采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，校准余弦相似度和噪声增量范数比，支持激进跳过。

Result: 在Latte-1、OpenSora-Plan v110和Wan2.1上，TaoCache在相同加速下视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效、无需训练的缓存策略，适用于DiT框架，并能与其他加速方法互补。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs在颜色推荐任务中具有潜力，ColorGPT为设计领域提供了一种新的有效工具。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌并突出关键帧信息的方法，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在压缩视频时忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，可能导致重要信息丢失，因此需要一种更智能的压缩方法。

Method: KFFocus通过基于时间冗余的关键帧识别和动态压缩比分配，结合时空建模模块，优化视频令牌压缩。

Result: 在长视频场景的实验中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，计算效率和准确性均有提升。

Conclusion: KFFocus为视频LLMs提供了一种高效的压缩和时空建模解决方案，适用于复杂视频理解任务。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示方法无法从多尺度角度捕捉运动，且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的能力。

Method: 引入MSQ方法，将运动序列压缩为空间和时间维度的多尺度离散标记，使用不同编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部分，并通过时间插值生成多尺度特征后量化。

Result: 实验表明，MSQ方法无需专门设计或重新训练即可无缝组合运动标记，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ方法在多尺度运动表示和组合灵活性方面具有显著优势，为运动编辑、控制和条件生成提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

Motivation: 现有Retinex深度学习方法在分解图像时存在互分量残差（ICR），影响分解精度和增强效果，导致最终图像质量下降。

Method: 提出IRetinex模型，在分解阶段减少光照和反射分量之间的特征相似性，在增强阶段利用特征相似性检测和减轻ICR的影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，IRetinex模型显著提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Result: 在多种医学图像模态上验证，UC-Seg在分割准确性和泛化性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UC-Seg通过减少认知偏差和生成高质量伪标签，提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，亟需利用大规模无标签数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet通过文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成，结合跨域知识蒸馏，解决域差距和利用无标签样本。

Result: 在11个数据集上，DPGNet性能优于现有方法6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet有效利用无标签数据，解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Method: 采用主动学习框架，结合人机交互机制，动态选择标注数据并生成自适应阈值。

Result: 在模拟真实场景中，EBI（误差平衡指数）达到68.91，显著提升了动态环境下的检测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性和准确性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合LoRA高效适应VLMs，并设计联合语义-几何损失（早期用语义损失，后期用3D IoU损失）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature

This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average

insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，成本低且性能优异。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as

Result: 评估表明数据集的价值，但也揭示了建模复杂人体外观与光照交互的挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将促进未来研究，推动重光照和渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合轨迹优化和全身控制的架构，通过模型抽象实现人形机器人高动态运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人执行高动态运动（如杂技动作）的挑战，克服高自由度带来的复杂性。

Method: 采用轨迹优化和全身控制，中间通过模型抽象匹配，基于完整的刚体动力学方程。

Result: 在仿真中验证了系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 该架构能够实现复杂的高动态运动，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Endowing humanoid robots with the ability to perform highly dynamic motions
akin to human-level acrobatics has been a long-standing challenge. Successfully
performing these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying
physics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during
execution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high
degree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,
which makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical
workarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,
neither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true
robotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising
trajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching
model abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including
constraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of
motion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and
control methods is given, followed by implementation details including model
abstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller. The system's
effectiveness is analyzed in simulation.

TL;DR: 使用Koopman算子构建高维线性模型，结合LMPC实现四足机器人高精度跟踪与抗干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线优化控制四足机器人需适应实时变化，但传统LMPC因线性化模型导致精度不足。

Method: 利用Koopman算子在高维空间构建保留非线性特性的线性模型，结合LMPC实现控制。

Result: 实验展示了高精度跟踪和抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: 首次将Koopman算子理论应用于四足机器人LMPC，效果显著。

Abstract: Online optimal control of quadruped robots would enable them to adapt to
varying inputs and changing conditions in real time. A common way of achieving
this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming
(QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and
linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved
on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In
this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the
quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity
of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity
tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first
work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion.

TL;DR: eIFP-MPC是IFP的优化版本，通过改进威胁优先级、路径稳定性和动态可行性，显著提升了对称和高密度环境中的多机器人路径规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IFP在对称配置中因镜像交互导致的碰撞和死锁问题，提升其在密集动态环境中的鲁棒性和路径一致性。

Method: 引入时间碰撞启发式优化威胁优先级，通过基于成本的路径点选择稳定路径生成，并结合模型预测控制（MPC）确保动态可行性。

Result: 在对称和高密度场景的模拟中，eIFP-MPC显著减少振荡，确保无碰撞运动，并提高轨迹效率。

Conclusion: 几何规划器通过优化可以增强性能，适用于复杂多智能体环境中的大规模应用。

Abstract: The Iterative Forecast Planner (IFP) is a geometric planning approach that
offers lightweight computations, scalable, and reactive solutions for
multi-robot path planning in decentralized, communication-free settings.
However, it struggles in symmetric configurations, where mirrored interactions
often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and
extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense,
dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a
time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based
via-point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model
predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are
tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its
adaptability and stability. Extensive simulations across symmetric and
high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations,
ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results
demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization,
enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌腱驱动机器人手的控制学习复杂且昂贵，现有视觉跟踪方法易受遮挡和误差影响，而sEMG传感器提供了一种低成本、鲁棒的替代方案。

Method: 扩展了emg2pose数据集，引入肌腱控制信号，提供了三种基线回归模型，并提出了一种基于扩散的回归模型。

Result: 数据集包含193名受试者的370小时记录，覆盖29种手势，解决了现有方法的无效姿势问题。

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型框架为肌腱驱动的灵巧机器人操作提供了重要进展，为可扩展和准确的肌腱控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

Abstract: Efficient mobility and power consumption are critical for autonomous water
surface robots in long-term water environmental monitoring. This study develops
and evaluates a transformable mobility mechanism for a water surface robot with
two control modes: station-keeping and traveling to improve energy efficiency

two points, the traveling mode reduces power consumption by 10\% and decreases

These results confirm the effectiveness of the transformable mobility mechanism

Conclusion: DQ-Bench和DQ-Net为动态抓取提供了系统评估和高效解决方案，扩展了四足机器人在动态场景中的应用。

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots with manipulators offer strong mobility and adaptability
for grasping in unstructured, dynamic environments through coordinated
whole-body control. However, existing research has predominantly focused on
static-object grasping, neglecting the challenges posed by dynamic targets and
thus limiting applicability in dynamic scenarios such as logistics sorting and
human-robot collaboration. To address this, we introduce DQ-Bench, a new
benchmark that systematically evaluates dynamic grasping across varying object
motions, velocities, heights, object types, and terrain complexities, along
with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building upon this benchmark, we propose
DQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp
configurations from limited perceptual cues. During training, the teacher
network leverages privileged information to holistically model both the static
geometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics of the target, and
integrates a grasp fusion module to deliver robust guidance for motion
planning. Concurrently, we design a lightweight student network that performs
dual-viewpoint temporal modeling using only the target mask, depth map, and
proprioceptive state, enabling closed-loop action outputs without reliance on
privileged data. Extensive experiments on DQ-Bench demonstrate that DQ-Net
achieves robust dynamic objects grasping across multiple task settings,
substantially outperforming baseline methods in both success rate and
responsiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Vicsek、Cucker-Smale）缺乏碰撞避免，Olfati-Saber模型则限制群体形态，限制了其在群体机器人中的应用。

Method: 基于相对位置、速度和局部密度，引入空间偏移和动力学偏移两个可调参数，构建模型。

Result: 模型实现了空间灵活、无碰撞的群体行为，并支持认知自主系统中的能量感知相变。

Conclusion: 该模型为多机器人系统（如自主空中群体）提供了鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple,
decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as
Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber
model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive
model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and
local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and
kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors
that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework
to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions
between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This
cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world
applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

Result: AZRA展示了如何快速原型设计和增强现有机器人，提升情感互动。

Conclusion: AZRA为未来仿生机器人开发提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Zoomorphic robots could serve as accessible and practical alternatives for
users unable or unwilling to keep pets. However, their affective interactions
are often simplistic and short-lived, limiting their potential for domestic
adoption. In order to facilitate more dynamic and nuanced affective
interactions and relationships between users and zoomorphic robots we present
AZRA, a novel augmented reality (AR) framework that extends the affective
capabilities of these robots without physical modifications. To demonstrate
AZRA, we augment a zoomorphic robot, Petit Qoobo, with novel emotional displays
(face, light, sound, thought bubbles) and interaction modalities (voice, touch,
proximity, gaze). Additionally, AZRA features a computational model of emotion
to calculate the robot's emotional responses, daily moods, evolving personality
and needs. We highlight how AZRA can be used for rapid participatory
prototyping and enhancing existing robots, then discuss implications on future
zoomorphic robot development.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support
coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are
trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and
interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses
worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct
inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for
multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an
autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual
robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention
between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies
convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full
fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph
neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these
models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on
prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor
models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the
localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also
present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of
larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.

Conclusion: GSMR和GSCLO为RoboMR系统提供了一种高效、低成本的通信解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR
(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a
photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS
model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS
model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this
end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which
jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or
not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across
different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO
problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm
that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional
branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are
presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method
achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and
legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first
time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication
costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic
scenarios.

system. The amphibious wing, redesigned based on a fixed-wing structure,
features a single degree of freedom in pitch and requires no additional
components. It can generate lift in the air and function as a flapping wing for
propulsion underwater, reducing disturbance to marine life and making it
environmentally friendly. Additionally, an artificial central pattern generator
(CPG) is introduced to enhance the smoothness of the flapping motion. This

this concept.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language
foundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of
task generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of
tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA
models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in
contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a
novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions
are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder
framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse
vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision
transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we
introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing
textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.
With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile
datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned
tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better
initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial
improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates
with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with
dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,
OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother
trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型在模仿学习中生成的运动策略在复杂环境中安全性不足，PF2MP旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PF2MP，通过学习成功演示中的势场信息，调制流匹配向量场，实现安全运动生成。

Result: 在仿真和现实环境中验证，PF2MP显著减少碰撞，同时保持任务成功率。

Conclusion: PF2MP为复杂环境中的安全运动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching models, have
recently shown remarkable potential in learning complex policies through
imitation learning. However, the safety of generated motions remains
overlooked, particularly in complex environments with inherent obstacles. In
this work, we address this critical gap by proposing Potential Field-Guided
Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP), a novel approach that simultaneously learns task
policies and extracts obstacle-related information, represented as a potential
field, from the same set of successful demonstrations. During inference, PF2MP
modulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field,
enabling safe motion generation. By leveraging these complementary fields, our
approach achieves improved safety without compromising task success across
diverse environments, such as navigation tasks and robotic manipulation
scenarios. We evaluate PF2MP in both simulation and real-world settings,
demonstrating its effectiveness in task space and joint space control.

### [89] [Boosting Action-Information via a Variational Bottleneck on Unlabelled Robot Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08743)
*Haoyu Zhang,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过最大化潜在动作与真实动作的互信息，直接从无标签视频演示中学习，提升控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于演示的学习依赖大量标注数据，限制了训练规模；现有无标签方法提取的潜在动作与真实动作互信息低，导致性能不佳。

Method: 利用变分信息瓶颈提取与动作相关的表示，同时丢弃任务无关信息，理论分析表明该方法能最大化潜在与真实动作的互信息。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，该方法显著提升了互信息，并持续改善策略性能。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了无标签视频学习中的动作表示问题，为机器人控制提供了更高效的数据利用方式。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations (LfD) typically relies on large amounts of
action-labeled expert trajectories, which fundamentally constrains the scale of
available training data. A promising alternative is to learn directly from
unlabeled video demonstrations. However, we find that existing methods tend to
encode latent actions that share little mutual information with the true robot
actions, leading to suboptimal control performance. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel framework that explicitly maximizes the mutual information
between latent actions and true actions, even in the absence of action labels.
Our method leverage the variational information-bottleneck to extract
action-relevant representations while discarding task-irrelevant information.
We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our objective indeed maximizes
the mutual information between latent and true actions. Finally, we validate
our approach through extensive experiments: first in simulated robotic
environments and then on real-world robotic platforms, the experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances mutual information and
consistently improves policy performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于标注引导视觉提示和动作分块模仿学习的机器人抓取放置系统，解决了零售环境中密集物体排列和遮挡等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便利店中的机器人抓取放置任务因物体密集、遮挡和属性差异（如颜色、形状、大小和纹理）而复杂化，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 采用标注引导视觉提示（通过边界框标注识别可抓取物体和放置位置），并结合动作分块Transformer（ACT）模仿学习算法，预测分块动作序列。

Result: 系统在抓取成功率和适应性方面表现优异，验证了其在零售环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化空间指导和数据驱动的动作预测，显著提升了机器人操作的流畅性和适应性。

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

TL;DR: 研究探讨机器人能否通过社交层级干预减少上级主导，促进讨论平等参与。实验表明机器人行为可能影响发言时间，但未显著差异，且不影响上级满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在层级化讨论中，上级可能主导发言，机器人干预或可平衡参与。

Method: 30名医生和学生参与实验，机器人根据层级鼓励发言，比较无干预和均等干预。

Result: 机器人行为可能影响发言时间，但未显著差异，且上级满意度未降低。

Conclusion: 机器人干预或可抑制上级主导，促进讨论平等参与。

Abstract: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social
hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize
participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures.
Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as
participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that
can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were
compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without
considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow
actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting
speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical
relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental
results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the
speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there
were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However,
the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time
without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in
discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate,
controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress
dominance and equalize participation among group members.

TL;DR: AffordDex是一个两阶段训练框架，通过学习通用抓取策略，结合运动先验和物体功能理解，实现了通用灵巧抓取，并显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注低级抓取稳定性，忽略了功能感知定位和类人姿态，这对下游操作至关重要。

Method: AffordDex采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过模仿人类手部运动预训练轨迹模仿器；第二阶段通过残差模块调整运动以适应特定物体，并引入负功能感知分割模块和特权师生蒸馏。

Result: AffordDex不仅实现了通用灵巧抓取，还在姿态和接触位置上表现出类人性和功能适应性，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: AffordDex通过结合运动先验和功能理解，为通用灵巧抓取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for
the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus
narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware
positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation.
To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with
two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent
understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage,
a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to
instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual
module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object
instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative
Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally
inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation
process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal
dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and
functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects,
unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索对机器人学习敏捷运动行为至关重要，但传统方法依赖人工奖励设计或专家演示，限制了泛化能力。

Method: SDAX利用无监督技能发现和双层优化动态调节探索程度。

Result: 机器人学会了爬行、攀爬、跳跃等敏捷行为，并在真实硬件上成功部署。

Conclusion: SDAX显著减少了人工干预，实现了高效且泛化的技能学习。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

TL;DR: 论文提出Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR)框架，通过分层生成模型推断潜在程序，实现机器人从少量演示中泛化到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人需要大量示例且泛化能力差的问题，认为关键在于恢复智能行为的潜在解释（如结构化程序）。

Method: RIR框架结合分层生成模型和贝叶斯程序归纳，通过视觉语言模型提出任务假设，规划器评分生成可执行程序。

Result: RIR在连续操作任务中，仅需一次演示即可推断任务结构并泛化到新场景，优于现有视觉语言模型基线。

Conclusion: RIR通过推断潜在程序，显著提升了机器人从少量演示中学习和泛化的能力。

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

Abstract: Expressive behaviors in robots are critical for effectively conveying their
emotional states during interactions with humans. In this work, we present a
framework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional
expressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality
(MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a
first-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements,
and upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic
components including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a
flow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent
and varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned
explicitly on given emotional states. A preliminary test validated the
effectiveness of our approach for generating autonomous expressions.

Result: 在40吨物料搬运设备上验证了框架的有效性，比人工操作更精确、可重复且安全。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了全规模物料搬运任务的自动化，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large
quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo
ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive,
labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using
large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this
work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of
large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules
for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and
motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement
learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping
locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the
number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses
the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in
movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material
through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world
experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing
on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck
loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational
safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of
material handling tasks on a full scale.

Result: 在LIBERO和ManiSkill2仿真基准测试中表现优异，并在真实任务中展现出高度适应性、尺度感知和视角不变性。

Conclusion: GeoVLA通过整合3D信息显著提升了机器人操作的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising approach for
enabling robots to follow language instructions and predict corresponding
actions.However, current VLA models mainly rely on 2D visual inputs, neglecting
the rich geometric information in the 3D physical world, which limits their
spatial awareness and adaptability. In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel
VLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic
manipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and
language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,
it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point
encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings
independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by
our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,
which combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise
action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and
robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO and ManiSkill2
simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in real-world tasks
requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint invariance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弗吉尼亚17-18世纪土地专利的描述形式限制了空间分析，研究旨在探索LLM在历史地理定位中的潜力。

Method: 使用6种OpenAI模型，在两种范式下（直接转换和工具增强链式思考）测试5,471份专利摘要，并与GIS分析师等基线方法对比。

Result: 最佳模型平均误差23公里，优于其他LLM和传统方法；成本效益高的模型在每千份专利中仅需1.09美元。

Conclusion: LLM在历史地理定位中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Result: Hat-DFed框架在复杂边缘环境中能同时提升模型性能和降低能耗。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为边缘计算系统中的去中心化联邦学习提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

Motivation: 水质预测因复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变而具有挑战性，多站点场景进一步增加了时空动态建模的难度。

Conclusion: XFMNet通过逐步递归融合，有效捕捉长期趋势和短期波动，适用于空间分布时间序列预测。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和模块化设计，有效提升了域自适应性能，适用于时间序列分类。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Result: 提出了容量定理、误差传播分析和生物学习规则对Transformer架构的潜在优化。

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功可能源于实现生物学优化的计算原理，而不仅仅是架构创新。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Conclusion: 该方法结合了物理信息和概率建模，提高了高光谱成像目标识别的可解释性和灵活性。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Conclusion: MLP的显式通道混合有助于学习更鲁棒和泛化的计算模式，DAMP有望成为超网络的目标架构。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Conclusion: 统计方法适用于已知或建模良好的光谱，而机器学习在不确定条件下是更好的选择；统计方法在量化任务中更准确。

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

Motivation: GNN在深度层存在过平滑问题，现有方法无法有效处理深层特征，而Mamba和交叉注意力各有优缺点，需解决全局-局部权衡问题。

Method: 提出HSA-Net，包含分层自适应投影器（HAP）和源感知融合（SAF）模块，动态选择投影方式并融合多级特征。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于当前SOTA方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层和结构感知设计，有效解决了GNN的过平滑问题，提升了分子表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中设备计算异构性、通信成本高和模型聚合复杂的问题。

Result: 在图像分类和分割任务中，数据传输减少90%以上，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL高效且可扩展，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [111] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM) introduces fuzzy clause evaluation, reducing clauses and improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Tsetlin Machines require thousands of clauses due to strict 'all-or-nothing' evaluation, limiting efficiency.

Method: FPTM uses fuzzy evaluation, allowing partial contributions from clauses with failed literals, enhancing flexibility.

Result: FPTM achieves high accuracy with fewer clauses, faster training, and smaller memory footprint on datasets like IMDb and Fashion-MNIST.

Conclusion: FPTM outperforms existing methods, offering a scalable and efficient solution for pattern matching.

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，为缩放点积注意力机制（SDPA）提供了理论依据，揭示了其前向传播和后向传播的数学本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDPA的数学形式通常由启发式方法驱动，缺乏理论支持。本文旨在从优化和强化学习的角度为其提供理论基础。

Method: 通过将SDPA的前向传播建模为一个退化的单边熵最优传输（EOT）问题，并证明后向传播的梯度与基于优势的策略梯度在数学上等价。

Result: 揭示了SDPA的前向传播是EOT问题的精确解，后向传播的梯度具有信息几何特性，表现为基于优势的更新。

Conclusion: SDPA是一个理论完备的机制，前向传播执行最优推断，后向传播实现基于流形的学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Conclusion: FWPs为人工神经网络提供了新的研究方向，可能促进自然与人工智能的融合。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Result: 在合成数据和真实基因扰动数据上，DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂因素识别上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF不仅性能优越，还提供了理论一致性保证。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，DiGNNExplainer生成的解释更真实且忠实于模型决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer填补了异构图解释方法的空白，为节点分类任务提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的部分最优传输（POT）方法，通过二次正则化（QPOT）替代传统的熵正则化，以实现稀疏传输计划，提升实际应用中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）假设输入度量质量相等，而现实数据往往不平衡。POT解决了这一问题，但现有方法依赖熵正则化，导致传输计划稠密，不利于需要稀疏性的应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于二次正则化的POT方法（QPOT），以诱导稀疏传输计划。

Result: 在合成数据、CIFAR-10数据集及实际应用（如颜色迁移和领域适应）中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为POT提供了一种稀疏性更强的替代方案，适用于需要稀疏传输计划的应用场景。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Result: 在异构环境中，该方法显著加速训练，且精度与同步SGD相当或更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至多种异构环境，如云平台和高性能计算集群。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: 实验表明，SHEFL有效解决了计算异构性，显著提升了公平性和整体性能。

Conclusion: SHEFL为异构计算环境下的联邦学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法显著提升了多种OCIL模型的性能，适应不同内存预算。

Conclusion: GWM和多级协作蒸馏机制有效平衡了稳定性和适应性，提升了OCIL模型的性能。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

*Long Wang,Kai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DiFac的半监督学习框架，通过从单一信息源提取差异化因子并强制其一致性，解决了伪标签确认偏差和训练崩溃问题，同时引入辅助决策因子提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督学习中，引入相互独立的决策因子以缓解伪标签确认偏差和训练崩溃是有效策略，但实践中获取此类因子具有挑战性。

Method: DiFac框架从单一信息源提取差异化因子，并通过一致性约束优化模型；结合辅助信息源（如多模态语言模型）引入额外决策因子，设计问责评分机制减少错误判断。

Result: 实验表明，DiFac在低标签情况下显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: DiFac通过差异化因子和辅助信息源的结合，有效解决了半监督学习中的关键问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出开源模板，用于满足欧盟AI法案的技术文档要求，覆盖AI全生命周期，确保透明性、可追溯性和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统文档模板未能完全满足欧盟AI法案的技术文档要求，且未覆盖AI全生命周期。

Method: 引入开源模板，用于数据、模型和应用的文档化，并通过用户反馈和实际场景验证其可用性。

Result: 模板在真实场景中验证有效，支持合规性和负责任AI开发。

Conclusion: TechOps可作为实用工具，支持监管合规和负责任AI开发。

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TempOpt的无监督告警关系学习技术，用于电信网络中高效识别根告警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信网络中告警数量庞大且复杂，传统方法难以有效识别根告警，需改进告警关系学习。

Method: 采用TempOpt技术，克服了现有时间依赖性方法的局限性。

Result: 在真实网络数据集上实验，TempOpt学习的告警关系质量优于时间依赖性方法。

Conclusion: TempOpt是一种实用且高效的告警关系学习方法，适用于复杂网络环境。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Motivation: 传统Transformer模型参数过多且难以捕捉非平稳特征，而MLP模型在多通道依赖处理上表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: 提出WaveTS-B模型，结合小波变换和MLP；进一步提出WaveTS-M模型，采用通道聚类策略和MoE框架处理多通道依赖。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，WaveTS系列模型以较少的参数实现了SOTA性能，WaveTS-M在多通道数据集上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型在轻量化和多通道处理方面具有显著优势，为时间序列预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成机器学习在设计表示和探索中具有潜力，但受限于需要大量现有设计数据和缺乏对驱动最优性特征的解释。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提升质量和可靠性，扩展了生成机器学习模型在系统设计中的适用性。

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Oblivionis框架解决了联邦学习中LLM的遗忘问题，实现了选择性删除私有数据，提升了合规性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的LLM缺乏内置机制满足GDPR等法规的遗忘权需求，且现有框架无法选择性删除客户端贡献。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，将联邦学习和遗忘作为双重优化目标，整合了6种FL和5种遗忘算法。

Result: 实验表明Oblivionis优于本地训练，在遗忘效果和模型效用间取得平衡。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM的遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案，并指明了未来发展方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Result: 在二元和多类分类任务中，该方法在精度和稀疏性上优于现有技术，且无需梯度信息。

Conclusion: 遗传算法是识别强彩票子网络的有效方法，同时强调了在复杂架构和任务中需采用适当评估指标。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Motivation: 函数空间先验能更直观地将先验知识嵌入模型输出，但实现这一目标在BNNs中具有挑战性。

Method: 通过优化技术研究可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）如何适应复杂先验和目标函数分布。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐层的BNNs配备灵活可训练激活函数，也能有效实现目标函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 灵活的可训练激活函数为BNNs实现复杂函数空间先验提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Conclusion: APRNet通过解耦振幅和相位，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 发现持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度敏感，现有防御方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 类增量持续学习模型存在严重的安全隐患，需进一步研究防御策略。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN为复杂科学和工程问题提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering

Result: 实验表明，GenCast在多个真实数据集上显著降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理约束，有效解决了无传感器区域的交通预测问题。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Motivation: 传统图学习方法依赖静态邻域信息，无法动态调整顶点间的交互，限制了分类性能。

Method: GRAVITY将顶点建模为通过结构邻近性和属性相似性学习的相互作用力，形成潜在势场，顶点在势场中动态调整位置。

Result: 实验表明，GRAVITY在转导和归纳顶点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态交互和势场驱动，提升了顶点分类的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有潜力，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重可以有效地整合到可解释AI框架中，丰富了Transformer的解释能力。

Conclusion: 注意力权重能够增强Transformer模型的可解释性，为局部和全局解释提供了新思路。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Result: 模型在路径匹配精度上显著优于现有基线，并提供了多样化的有效设计。

Conclusion: MechaFormer的高质量输出可作为传统优化器的起点，形成高效混合方法。

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

deep learning based developments have resulted in significant improvements in
the performance of IDS systems. In this paper, we present FetFIDS, where we
explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to

algorithm optimizes pain management while minimizing opioid related adverse
events (ORADE) by employing machine learning models trained on observational
electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning
approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific
patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The
OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence
of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper
outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key
assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文系统比较了四种模型堆叠算法、42种拓扑链接预测器和两种图神经网络算法在550个真实网络上的表现，发现没有单一算法在所有网络中表现最佳，且算法性能与网络特性密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络数据中缺失链接预测的问题，特别是在没有节点属性的情况下，比较不同算法的性能并探究其与网络特性的关系。

Method: 使用550个结构多样的真实网络作为基准，比较模型堆叠算法、拓扑链接预测器和图神经网络算法在AUC和Top-k两种标准下的表现。

Result: 模型堆叠（随机森林）在AUC上表现优异，与图神经网络在Top-k上竞争；算法性能与网络特性（如度分布、三角密度等）强相关。

Conclusion: 提出一种元学习算法，根据网络特性选择最佳算法，显著优于现有方法且可扩展到大网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过主动测试和上下文学习，高效评估大型语言模型（LLM），减少数据需求和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主动测试在评估大型模型时计算成本高的问题，提升评估效率。

Method: 利用上下文学习构建廉价代理模型，无需在主动测试循环中更新，甚至无需目标模型预测。

Result: 方法能更有效地评估LLM性能，比现有标准实践所需数据更少。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模模型评估提供了一种高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

TL;DR: Chi-Geometry是一个生成用于测试和基准化GNN预测手性能力的图数据库，通过合成具有特定几何和拓扑特征的图样本，并设计新GNN架构以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更可解释且减少混淆地评估GNN在手性预测任务中的表现，并指导设计性能更优的GNN架构。

Method: Chi-Geometry生成包含一个手性中心（标记为R或S）的合成图样本，结合成数据集用于GNN基准测试。基于测试结果设计两种新GNN架构。

Result: 第一种GNN架构通过全连接提升预测准确性但计算成本高；第二种引入虚拟节点保持线性计算成本同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry为GNN手性预测提供了有效的基准测试工具，并指导了两种新架构的设计，平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自然语言推理和形式化语言的几何问题解决方法，通过混合推理轨迹提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在几何问题解决（GPS）中存在局限性，主要是由于不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理。

Method: 采用链式思维（CoT）与形式化语言结合的方法，模型交替生成自然语言推理和可执行的形式化代码。通过监督微调和强化学习优化推理和程序生成。

Result: 新模型GF-Reasoner在标准GPS基准测试中提升了15%的准确率，优于同类模型。

Conclusion: 通过结合高阶几何知识和符号计算，生成的推理轨迹更简洁高效，为未来研究提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一个通用的神经推理模型，用于处理异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，支持跨数据集的特征依赖学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据通常具有多样化和不连贯的形式，如不同的模式、不一致的语义和无固定特征顺序，这使得构建能够跨数据集利用信息的通用模型具有挑战性。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的置换不变Transformer和语义接地模块，利用自然语言描述、数据集元数据和上下文示例来学习跨数据集特征依赖。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现优异，并支持在开放世界设置中成本感知的主动特征获取。

Conclusion: ASPIRE为实现真正通用的、语义感知的结构化数据推理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNNs）在安全关键场景（如自动驾驶和医疗）中因校准不佳可能导致严重后果，现有方法对欠置信引起的校准误差关注不足。

Method: 提出MaC-Cal方法，采用两阶段训练和自适应稀疏性，动态调整掩码保留率以优化置信度与准确性对齐。

Result: 实验表明，MaC-Cal在校准性能和数据损坏下的鲁棒性上表现优越。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为DNNs提供了可靠置信度估计的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于在低剂量儿科X射线中去噪并保留诊断相关特征，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境中，儿科胸部X射线成像对早期诊断至关重要，但低剂量协议引入的噪声会掩盖关键解剖细节，传统去噪方法可能损害诊断准确性。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习的融合模块，自适应平衡噪声抑制与结构细节保留，并通过模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，并将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.
