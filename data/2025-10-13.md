### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统CNN、零样本多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，匹配或超越需要大量数据的CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中展现出新的能力，但其潜力在专业视觉任务中尚未充分挖掘，往往表现不佳。本研究旨在探索如何通过有限数据有效微调LLM来提升其在精确视觉理解任务中的表现。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，特别关注LLM在少于1000张图像数据上的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的多模态LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务上实现了高达36%的准确率提升，匹配或超越了需要大量数据的CNN基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM方法在数据效率和适应性方面具有显著优势，为低资源视觉环境中的多模态transformer应用提供了实用指导，证明了跨模态学习策略的有效性。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

### [2] [Reproducible Evaluation of Data Augmentation and Loss Functions for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08617)
*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究对U-Net在脑肿瘤MRI分割中的性能进行了可重复性评估，使用焦点损失和基础数据增强策略，实现了90%的精确度，为未来研究提供了透明基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展，需要建立可重复的基准研究。

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上评估U-Net分割性能，采用焦点损失参数调优和三种数据增强技术：水平翻转、旋转和缩放。

Result: 使用焦点损失的U-Net实现了90%的精确度，与最先进结果相当，所有代码和结果均已公开。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了透明、可重复的基准，为未来脑肿瘤分割中增强策略和损失函数设计的研究提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，既能显著降低记忆化又能保持图像与文本的对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆化，但这会导致图像与提示词对齐不佳。

Method: 通过实证发现初始噪声样本影响逃逸时间，提出两种策略：集体调整和个体调整初始噪声，寻找能促进早期逃逸的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像与文本的良好对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声在决定记忆化逃逸时间中起关键作用，通过适当调整初始噪声可以有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了DALL-E 3和Ideogram两种AI图像生成工具在职业图像生成中的代表性偏见，发现两者都强化了传统性别刻板印象，但程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在可视化创作方面提供了巨大机会，但现有研究主要关注创建过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题。随着AI图像工具的广泛使用，解决和减轻有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和专业环境中的多样化表征至关重要。

Method: 研究通过生成超过750张AI职业图像，使用主题分析方法评估DALL-E 3和Ideogram两种工具在职业图像生成中的性别代表性偏见，并讨论了年龄和情感等话题。

Result: 分析结果显示，DALL-E 3和Ideogram都在AI生成的图像中强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度有所不同。这表明AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要采取措施增加可见性别图像生成时的代表性，并为从业者、个人和研究人员提出了相关建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型(VAR)中集成动态专家混合路由，通过尺度感知阈值减少计算冗余，在保持图像质量的同时降低20% FLOPs和加速11%推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在不同分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要优化计算效率。

Method: 集成动态专家混合路由，采用尺度感知阈值策略平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，推理速度提升11%，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 动态专家混合路由能有效优化VAR模型的计算效率，实现计算与质量的平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中有效识别未知物体，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，容易将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性用于OOD检测，无需辅助数据或额外训练。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上显著优于现有方法：AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降至40%（降低36%）。

Conclusion: 基于层次贝叶斯建模的认知不确定性方法能有效解决无监督OOD检测中的不确定性混淆问题，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并提供超越二元分类的层次化定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在训练数据中活动范围与现实生活中活动范围之间的巨大差距，未处理未知活动会严重削弱分类器的可靠性。同时，活动类别之间存在不同程度的相似性和层次关系。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，开发Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，能够识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，还能将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 提出了新的NFI_FARED数据集，包含19个不同情境下的活动数据，完全公开可供下载。Hi-OSCAR能够实现开放集分类并提供层次化定位能力。

Conclusion: 通过层次化方法解决了HAR中的开放集问题，不仅提高了分类器的可靠性，还提供了更丰富的活动理解，为未来开放集HAR研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类的高频振荡自动检测方法，在80-500Hz频段内区分HFOs与尖峰、背景活动和伪影，在控制数据集上达到97.67%的灵敏度和98.57%的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别耗时、费力且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用S变换从时频域提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分HFOs与尖峰、背景活动和伪影。

Result: 在控制数据集上灵敏度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs比率达0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速波纹）可达到无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs会导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [9] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了DINOv2模型的表示机制，通过稀疏自编码器构建了32,000个概念词典，揭示了模型在分类、分割和深度估计任务中的功能专门化，并提出了基于凸混合原型的新表示假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部表示机制仍不明确。本文旨在理解DINOv2感知的本质，通过构建可解释性词典来分析其表示结构。

Method: 采用线性表示假设，使用稀疏自编码器构建32,000个单元的概念词典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究表示几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现分类任务利用'Elsewhere'概念实现学习否定；分割依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单眼深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假设，认为token是通过凸混合原型组合形成的，这种结构基于Gardenfors概念空间理论，为理解视觉Transformer表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光照），在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理遥感图像采集过程中的复杂异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器和频率感知退化分解器，从流形几何和频率角度分析退化特征，结合物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在所有四种修复任务中均取得优越性能，显著超越现有方法，同时大幅减少参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，为遥感图像多退化修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Motivation: 解决现实临床决策中整合多模态数据（医疗文本、2D/3D图像、视频）的挑战，克服通用视觉语言模型在医学应用中存在的流程不透明、数据稀缺和架构不灵活等问题。

Method: 基于统一的分块视觉编码器和LLM解码器构建，逐步训练1670万个样本，从2D扩展到3D和视频理解，采用医学感知的令牌缩减实现高效训练。

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程证明高性能医学VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

*Kang Liao,Size Wu,Zhonghua Wu,Linyi Jin,Chao Wang,Yikai Wang,Fei Wang,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，能够从任意视角理解和生成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的相机中心理解和生成研究通常是分离的，缺乏统一的模型来同时处理这两个任务。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，结合语言回归和基于扩散的生成方法，使用包含400万视觉-语言-相机三元组的大规模数据集Puffin-4M进行训练。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专门的模型，并能泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

### [13] [Structured Output Regularization: a framework for few-shot transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08728)
*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结网络内部结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少量数据下实现更好的迁移学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据极少时仍容易过拟合

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少额外参数将模型定制到特定数据

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务上评估SOR，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础模型取得了与现有基准相竞争的结果

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛适用性

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对多模态大语言模型具身能力的全面系统评估。

Method: 提出BEAR基准，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本条目，涵盖6个类别。同时提出BEAR-Agent，集成预训练视觉模型来增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 评估20个代表性MLLM发现它们在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限性。BEAR-Agent在BEAR基准上实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 提升MLLM的具身能力有助于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为系统评估具身能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种受生物视觉机制启发的对抗防御框架，通过模拟人眼注视点移动、中央-周边处理和皮层填充机制，在不需重新训练分类器的情况下有效提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御方法计算成本高，而人类视觉系统通过生物机制天然具备对抗扰动的鲁棒性。研究旨在探索注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码在实现这种鲁棒性中的作用。

Method: 结合三种关键生物机制：中央-周边处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充。使用强化学习引导的眼跳选择性捕获多个中央-周边瞥视，整合成重建图像后再进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提升多种分类器和攻击类型下的系统鲁棒性，同时显著降低训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理能有效缓解对抗噪声、保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率领域的关键挑战，包括训练不稳定性、感知-失真权衡问题，实现了高效且高质量的图像超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，造成计算瓶颈。线性注意力提供线性复杂度解决方案，但存在训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决的关键挑战。

Method: 提出LinearSR框架：1）基于"拐点"的早期停止指导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2）SNR-based混合专家架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3）基于"精度优先于数量"原则的轻量级指导范式TAG。

Result: LinearSR同时实现了最先进的感知质量和卓越效率，核心扩散前向传递达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作为在真实感超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了首个稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率的未来研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入式的高效自动化识别方案。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从喂食器视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā个体重识别任务中达到了高准确率。

Conclusion: 这种基于AI和计算机视觉的非侵入式方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个用于通用视频质量评估的智能框架，通过多层级模型路由系统动态选择专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型泛化性差、可解释性有限和可扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型存在三个主要问题：(1) 对不同内容和任务（如用户生成内容、短视频、AI生成内容）的泛化能力差；(2) 可解释性有限；(3) 对新用例或内容类型的可扩展性不足。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉-语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重量级层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型性能，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性。在基于质量的问题回答基准Q-Bench-Video上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router通过智能设计结合了专业专家的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中实现了灵活性和鲁棒性，展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，并有望作为视频生成模型后训练中的奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法缺乏统一的模态对齐解决方案，硬负样本问题研究不足，且知识融合技术可能引入无关信息。

Method: 1) 多级多模态统一对齐方案；2) 使用软标签的硬负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的模态对齐、有效的硬负样本处理和选择性知识融合，显著提升了Med-VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一种加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低分辨率输入中的低细节区域，完全跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在视频生成和修复中很关键，但速度慢、成本高，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益很少，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比先前模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过简单而有效的策略，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少了视频超分辨率的计算量，为更高分辨率和更长视频的处理提供了可扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入，这超出了图像模型的能力范围。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间token聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重构为子问题）两种技术。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe有效提升了各种基准测试中的视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架通过动态压缩和问题分解，成功解决了视频大语言模型中的感知瓶颈和token过载问题，展示了处理复杂视频语言任务的潜力。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出FOLK方法，通过标签引导的知识蒸馏实现快速开放词汇3D实例分割，避免2D映射噪声并显著加速推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像进行VLM分类，但会引入2D遮挡噪声且计算内存成本高，推理速度慢

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中

Result: 在ScanNet200数据集上AP50达到35.7，比之前方法快6.0-152.2倍

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 蔓越莓种植中的变化监测通常需要人工完成，耗时且效率低。深度学习虽有潜力，但存在高维特征难以解释和需要大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 使用自监督方法微调视觉变换器，通过时间回归和类别预测的双重预训练任务学习植物和果实外观的时间演化潜在空间，生成可解释的2D时间轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于其他作物和场景，解决了传统监测方法效率低和深度学习需要大量标注数据的问题。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间乘积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量的方法，能够同时表达概念族内的层次结构和跨概念族的组合性，在多项任务中优于现有单空间方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念族内的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念族的组合性（如"车里的狗"⊆狗、车），虽然双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其对组合性的表达能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP在双曲因子笛卡尔积上采用ℓ₁-乘积度量，概念族内层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念族组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕捉，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间乘积和ℓ₁-乘积度量的设计，成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新颖的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射其语义信息来生成多样化的增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在分割模型中迁移性较差，主要由于模型间复杂的上下文依赖关系和特征分布差异导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成增强样本，用这些样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种不同分割模型和三种骨干网络上，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans在不引入额外计算开销的情况下，显著提高了对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击威胁深度模型知识产权，现有分类任务的防御方法难以直接应用于图像修复任务，因为修复任务具有连续高维输出且需要空间一致性。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值以注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在五种图像修复任务上测试，ASVP使学生模型PSNR降低达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像修复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法具有更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、对象、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据集。

Result: 评估8个最新视频MLLMs发现，在反事实视频内容上性能显著下降；通过反事实数据微调，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLMs的视频理解能力，强调了鲁棒性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hamba框架，结合图学习和状态空间建模，通过图引导的双向扫描机制，使用少量token高效学习关节空间关系，显著提升3D手部重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力机制的transformer方法在3D手部重建中未能实现鲁棒准确性能，主要原因是关节间空间关系建模效率低下。

Method: 设计图引导状态空间(GSS)块，学习图结构关系和关节空间序列，使用比注意力方法少88.5%的token；集成状态空间特征和全局特征的融合模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试和实际场景中显著优于现有SOTA方法，在FreiHAND上达到PA-MPVPE 5.3mm和F@15mm 0.992，在两个3D手部重建竞赛排行榜中排名第一。

Conclusion: Hamba通过图引导状态空间建模有效利用图结构特征，同时考虑全局和局部特征，实现了3D手部重建的显著性能提升。

Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the
articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA
methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and
shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily
due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this
problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which
bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to
reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D
reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently
learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction
performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block
that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and
uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we
integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion
module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively
leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global
and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks
and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing
SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the
time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two
Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction. Project Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，传统迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大型数据集而效果不佳，需要针对动物监测的特定数据增强策略。

Method: 提出对象聚焦的数据增强框架，分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术创建真实多样的场景，增强动物检测和监测性能。

Result: 初步实验表明，使用增强数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能实现实时动物健康监测，弥合了有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过增强视觉感知的token丰富度并分解复杂感知问题，显著提升大视觉语言模型的感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上从8.0%提升到64.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时缩放技术主要提升大视觉语言模型的推理能力，但对视觉感知的影响尚不明确。当前LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对底层感知过程的建模。

Method: 提出Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)范式，鼓励token丰富的感知，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，结合强化学习技术实现感知与推理时缩放的协同。

Result: PTS显著提升感知准确率，在DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升到64.7%，具有良好的领域外泛化能力，即使使用纯合成数据也能提升数学推理和真实世界感知性能。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关token和增强对图像token的关注，有效解决了当前LVLMs感知精度有限的问题，为视觉感知与推理时缩放的协同提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射常导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断关节位置，过度依赖先验知识会降低下游任务性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，增强预训练姿态估计器的输出，添加关节被感知可能性和位置可靠性的描述符。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置中超过115,000个信号帧的评估显示，描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模传感器数据依赖性，有效提高了毫米波姿态估计的可解释性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出HiMIR框架，通过分层多粒度图像检索和跨层次相似性一致性，提高检索精度并减少3.5倍计算量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有多向量检索方法仍存在精度和效率问题，忽略了查询与不同图像对象之间的对齐以及冗余的细粒度图像片段

Method: 1. 引入分层范式，使用多个中间粒度处理不同图像对象以增强对齐；2. 利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余检索；3. 自动为每个数据集配置参数

Result: HiMIR不仅显著提高了检索精度，还比现有MVR系统减少了高达3.5倍的计算量

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层多粒度检索和冗余最小化，在提高精度的同时大幅提升了检索效率

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DGLSS-NL任务，即带噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注通常存在噪声，这些噪声在领域偏移下会被放大，威胁系统可靠性。虽然图像中的噪声标签学习已有研究，但在3D LiDAR分割中的领域泛化问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，强制特征级一致性，并基于置信度感知过滤的交叉熵损失。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，为带噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）的细节生成上存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理的问题，而手部区域质量评估的缺失限制了相关下游任务的性能优化。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k高质量-低质量手部图像对），开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识。

Result: HandEval在人类标注测试集上比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，在图像生成和AIGC检测应用中分别显著提升了手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了生成手部质量评估的空白，提出的HandEval模型在下游应用中展现出普遍有效性，为相关领域提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Conclusion: 基于视觉Transformer的图像异常检测框架能够有效监控柔性微电极植入过程，提高植入的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Method: 提出Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多种输入变换来增强跨模型的可迁移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护防御开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境中树种实例分割数据集的空白，为开发更先进的森林管理感知系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token-by-token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，通常需要数千次模型前向传递才能生成单张图像，需要解决这种效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并通过低成本微调预测下一个干净token；在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代next-clean-token预测，使用概率准则并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功将去噪过程与Jacobi迭代结合，实现了自回归模型的并行token生成，有效解决了传统自回归模型推理效率低下的问题。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 构建包含1000多个图像-文本对的视觉问答数据集，评估32个多模态大语言模型在工具识别、工具理解和工具创造三个层次的能力。

Result: 评估显示多模态大语言模型在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

*Hoigi Seo,Dong Un Kang,Hyunjin Cho,Joohoon Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过识别和掩码视觉编码器中具有高认知不确定性的视觉标记来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，即生成图像中不存在的物体描述。研究发现视觉编码器中的不确定视觉标记是导致幻觉的关键因素。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的方法：1）使用对抗扰动识别不确定视觉标记；2）在视觉编码器中间层的自注意力过程中掩码这些不确定标记，抑制其对视觉编码的影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有技术协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来识别和抑制不确定视觉标记，可以有效缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

TL;DR: 提出了基于熵信息引导的解码策略，通过动态温度控制和熵感知接受规则，在提升自回归图像生成质量的同时加速采样过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归图像生成模型存在采样问题，图像token相比文本token具有更低的信息密度和非均匀空间分布特征。

Method: 1) 基于token分布空间熵的动态温度控制，提升内容多样性、对齐精度和结构一致性；2) 在推测解码中使用熵感知接受规则，实现近无损生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，能够在约85%的推理成本下实现近无损生成，显著提升生成质量和采样速度。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种自回归图像生成模型中均表现出良好的效果和泛化能力，成功解决了图像token采样效率低的问题。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Conclusion: 该后训练策略易于适配预训练模型，在医学图像转换任务中具有广泛应用潜力，能够改善临床诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并构建补丁级状态空间模型将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过有效建模局部细粒度几何结构，显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对准确高效的多目标跟踪技术有迫切需求，但复杂背景、小尺度目标和频繁遮挡等问题持续挑战现有方法。

Method: 采用GL-DT框架，包含时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协作检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测和跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

Motivation: DiT模型参数量大导致推理开销高，现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少而导致性能严重下降。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，提出混合块选择性激活DiT块，并设计了多步蒸馏流程包括泰勒度量专家初始化、负载均衡知识蒸馏和组特征损失优化。

Result: 将FLUX.1等大型扩散Transformer转换为MoE结构，FFN激活参数减少62.5%，总体激活参数减少60%，性能保持原始水平且优于剪枝方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

TL;DR: SOS是一个基于物体中心组合策略的简单可扩展数据合成管道，通过将高质量合成物体片段粘贴到新图像中，生成准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式，在检测和定位任务上超越真实图像数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型标注数据集成本高、覆盖偏差大且难以扩展，合成数据缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，将高质量合成物体片段粘贴到新图像中，实现可控的数据集构建。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在LVIS检测任务上达到+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO定位任务上达到+8.4 NAcc，优于GRIT(2000万)和V3Det(20万)等更大真实数据集。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置中改善泛化能力，增强LVIS和COCO等数据集能带来跨真实数据规模的强性能。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略能有效提升细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性问题，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角度处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 通过张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角度基，实现完全核分解，支持独立的径向和角度处理。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度降至O(N² log N)，内存需求降至O(N²)，条件数缩放降至O(√N)，比多项式方法有指数级改进，在结构化数据集上表现出更好的数值稳定性、计算效率和竞争性分类性能。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架使得先前经典方法无法实现的高阶矩分析成为可能，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明的系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任度和问责性。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或训练样本，但作者认为应该将这两种视角结合起来研究。

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，该方法将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能够提供细粒度的、特定于测试的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害样本，并揭示传统归因方法无法暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因为深度模型提供了新的内部工作机制洞察，能够识别传统方法无法发现的有害样本和虚假相关性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Motivation: 传统支气管镜导航方法依赖患者CT扫描和额外传感器，设置复杂且成本高。临床上通常只需要拓扑定位而非精确度量定位，因此开发无需CT扫描的图像定位方法。

Conclusion: 提出的图像支气管镜拓扑定位方法能够有效提供导航辅助，无需患者CT扫描，训练成本低且泛化能力强，在真实数据上表现优异。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非类别，但细粒度特性使得构建大规模标注数据集困难，限制了ILR在实际应用中的推广。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化的对象实例，包含不同条件和背景，构建大规模训练集，无需依赖任何真实图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为ILR提供了一种高效有效的替代方案，无需大量数据收集和整理，仅需目标领域名称即可解锁广泛的现实应用。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval

### [54] [TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173)
*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统方法仅标记为'未知'更具实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代目标检测器局限于'封闭世界'假设，无法处理现实场景中的新物体。传统开放集检测方法将所有未知物体归为单一'未知'类别不够实用，需要更细粒度的分类来支持安全关键决策。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的物体性建模头、层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督、学习层次关系的分类模块。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP上均取得竞争性表现。

Conclusion: TARO框架有效解决了传统开放集检测的局限性，通过层次化分类为未知物体提供更具描述性的子类别，在安全关键应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

*Johann-Friedrich Feiden,Tim Küchler,Denis Zavadski,Bogdan Savchynskyy,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，通过借鉴LLM的缓存和掩码技术，解决了现有方法无法在线处理的问题，在精度和VRAM使用上均优于现有方法，并能在边缘设备上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Video Depth Anything (VDA)方法虽然性能强大，但依赖批处理，无法在在线场景中使用。需要开发能够在实时在线设置中工作的视频深度估计方法。

Method: 借鉴大型语言模型的技术，在推理时缓存潜在特征，在训练时使用帧掩码技术，实现高效的在线视频深度估计。

Result: oVDA在准确性和VRAM使用方面均优于所有竞争方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在NVIDIA Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功解决了视频深度估计的在线处理问题，具有低VRAM占用和高效性能，适合在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Conclusion: 现代架构和系统优化能显著提升性能，标准化评估协议在体育视频分析研究中至关重要，研究提供了可复现的研究平台。

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可解释的驾驶员意图预测框架VCBM，通过DAAD-X数据集提供层次化的文本解释，展示了基于transformer的模型比CNN模型具有更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要。当前基于深度学习的系统在理解环境表征和驾驶任务方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM)框架，无需依赖后处理技术即可生成时空一致的解释；使用DAAD-X多模态数据集，包含驾驶员眼动和车辆视角的因果推理解释。

Result: 在DAAD-X数据集上的评估表明，基于transformer的模型比传统CNN模型具有更好的可解释性；提出了多标签t-SNE可视化技术来展示多个解释之间的解纠缠和因果相关性。

Conclusion: VCBM框架能够为驾驶员意图预测提供可解释的决策过程，transformer架构在可解释性方面优于CNN，为自动驾驶系统的安全交互提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于CLIP的多模态深度学习框架，通过语义线索提升牛只行为识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的准确率，并在少样本场景中表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康、生产力和福祉的重要指标。现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务中存在性能限制，需要提升识别准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 基于CLIP模型，添加时间整合模块，采用定制数据增强策略和专门文本提示来弥合预训练模型与真实监控视频之间的领域差距。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上，监督学习下整体准确率达96.1%，喂食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，少样本场景下也表现出稳健泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

### [59] [3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205)
*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，专门针对光子效率成像中的3D重建问题，通过精心设计的时空注意力机制提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在光子效率成像中，由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下，3D重建面临挑战。现有方法难以有效处理时空瞬态测量数据。

Method: 设计了TRT架构，包含时空自注意力编码器和时空交叉注意力解码器。编码器通过分割或下采样输入特征到不同尺度来探索瞬态数据的局部和全局相关性，解码器在token空间中整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 开发了TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个任务特定实现，在合成数据和真实世界数据上的实验表明，两种实现都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构为光子效率成像中的3D重建提供了有效的解决方案，同时贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实世界NLOS测量数据，促进了该领域的数据多样性。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [60] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型从自身生成的错误中学习，解决了训练假设与自回归推理之间的差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减少累积误差，但仍局限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。核心挑战在于训练假设（基于干净数据）与测试时自回归现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的根本差异。

Method: 采用错误回收微调技术：1）注入历史错误干预干净输入，模拟误差累积轨迹；2）通过一步双向积分高效近似预测并计算残差误差；3）在离散时间步上动态存储错误到回放记忆库，供新输入重采样使用。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调成功解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: 提出了TEMA-LLM框架，结合大语言模型进行语义标签生成，通过多注意力机制建模跨域用户偏好，在电商推荐系统中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐系统需要准确捕捉域内和跨域行为模式，为用户提供个性化体验。现有方法在语义理解和跨域建模方面存在局限。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与物品标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，提出标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签和多注意力集成对面向消费者的推荐系统具有显著优势，展示了LLM在推进智能用户中心服务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart

Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病早期准确诊断面临挑战，需要低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出HMVDx框架，使用两个MLLM分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指标。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为MLLM在医学视频理解领域的应用提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文建立了图像隐私分类的零样本基准，评估了顶级开源视觉语言模型(VLMs)与专用模型在隐私预测性能、效率和鲁棒性方面的对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用通用任务的视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专用模型的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本基准，使用任务对齐提示评估前3名开源VLMs，并与专用视觉和多模态方法对比性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: VLMs虽然在参数数量和推理速度上资源密集，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于更小的专用模型，但对图像扰动的鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: 尽管VLMs在通用任务中表现出色，但在图像隐私预测这一特定任务上，专用模型仍具有优势，特别是在准确性方面。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Conclusion: DSE方法能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，显著提高诊断答案准确性，为临床VLM应用提供了有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Conclusion: 该统一框架有效解决了RefVOS中的时序推理和细粒度视觉理解问题，避免了外部模型依赖，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

TL;DR: 提出了VPPO算法，通过token感知视角优化多模态RLVR，重点关注视觉依赖度高的关键token，显著提升LVLM的多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法在RLVR优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，需要从token感知角度重新审视多模态RLVR。

Method: 提出VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖度重新加权轨迹优势，并仅对感知关键token进行策略更新。

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 建立了分析多模态RLVR的新token级感知视角，提出了有效优化策略显著增强LVLM的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

TL;DR: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式，表明视觉信息获取采用最优效率策略。通过CNN模型可以从图像结构预测注视热点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的基本时空统计特性仍未充分探索。理解这些动态特性在注意力建模和视觉界面中有广泛应用。

Method: 进行大规模人类被试实验，40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点。训练CNN从图像输入预测注视热点图。

Result: 数据显示人类眼睛的注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式。CNN模型能够准确再现新颖图像中的显著注视区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似于自然觅食的统计规律，关键注视行为可以从视觉结构中学习，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建CapGeo-Bench基准数据集进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁文本描述，将视觉内容转换为标题是可行方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过辅助标题连接视觉和文本模态；创建CapGeo-Bench数据集（4,641个图形-标题对）并使用基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 配备标题后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升至59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升至73.0%。评估指标与下游性能强相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进MLLMs的几何推理能力提供了新途径，表明通过文本描述几何图形是有效的方法。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Result: 实验表明RadioFlow在保持重建精度的同时，参数减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RadioFlow为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来提取视觉先验，解决自监督单目深度估计中语义-空间知识提取不足的问题，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而遇到性能限制，需要更充分的上下文信息来提升深度估计精度。

Method: 采用从粗到精的渐进学习框架：1) 聚合CLIP的全局语义和DINO的局部空间细节特征，在对比语言指导下进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 集成相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法，并且确实有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，Hybrid-depth有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Motivation: 病理图像中的细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺，现有半监督方法在实例级别一致性正则化不足，且容易引入噪声伪标签。

Method: 提出IRCR-Net网络，包含匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，利用细胞核形态学先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签，增强高质量预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个公开数据集上显著提升半监督细胞核实例分割性能，在某些场景下甚至超越全监督方法。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的伪标签噪声问题，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异在红外图像上效果有限。

Method: PPFN网络基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过融合对应提示对来调制特征；引入选择性渐进训练机制逐步优化模型对复合情况的处理。

Conclusion: PPFN方法在热红外图像增强任务中表现出色，特别是在处理复合退化问题时具有显著优势，并建立了高质量的多场景红外基准数据集。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的基于视觉语言模型的方法在多模态关键词预测任务中表现优异，动态思维链策略能有效解决"过度思考"现象。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文，缺乏对纯视觉推理能力的评估。

Method: BLINK-Twice包含七种视觉挑战类型、自然对抗图像对和带注释的推理链，用于细粒度评估推理过程而非仅最终答案。

Conclusion: 需要为视觉推理开发新的范式，现有语言空间的推理策略在视觉推理中表现不稳定且冗余，主动视觉交互是未来发展方向。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在城市无界动态环境中，由于观察视锥重叠不足，导致点云覆盖不均匀和不完整，训练时会产生失真和伪影。现有致密化策略无法重建缺失结构。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过可靠的几何先验指导新高斯基元的生成，有效解决了3DGS在城市场景中因点云初始化不完整导致的几何恢复问题，为挑战性城市环境提供了鲁棒的3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor提供了一个灵活准确的文本驱动4D场景编辑框架，通过语言嵌入表示和精确定位策略有效解决了动态场景语义编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

TL;DR: DWTA-Net是一个两阶段低光视频增强框架，通过结合短期和长期时间信息来有效抑制噪声和伪影，提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的方法在真实低光场景中仍难以处理严重噪声，主要因为无法有效利用时间信息。

Method: 第一阶段使用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入基于光流引导的动态权重时间聚合循环细化模块。

Result: 在真实低光视频上的实验表明，DWTA-Net能有效抑制噪声和伪影，视觉质量优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，在低光视频增强中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化为视觉语言模型在真实部署场景中提供了简单有效的可靠性增强方案

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Conclusion: 建立了临床相关的交互式分割评估标准，揭示了影响算法性能的关键因素，为开发更鲁棒和实用的医学图像分割算法提供了指导。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S和A系列存在共同伪影模式导致指纹碰撞；PRO模式原始图像可可靠进行PRNU验证；对角线伪影可用于减少HDR误检和定位人像模式合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 三星智能手机对角线伪影影响PRNU验证，但原始图像可避免此问题；伪影在法证分析中具有应用价值，特别是对于无法获取原始图像的情况。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航拍图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限导致的信息退化问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节往往偏离原始图像信息，阻碍与语义内容的融合。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含两个模块：渐进细化颈部(PRN)通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐；增强切片采样(ESSamp)通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比较的计算约束下优于最先进方法，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和利用原始浅层空间特征，有效解决了小目标检测中的信息退化问题，在保持实时性的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Result: 在面部和图像变形以及高斯溅射变形等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的方法能够产生原则性和稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: TC-LoRA提出了一种动态参数化控制方法，通过超网络实时生成LoRA适配器来调节扩散模型的权重，相比静态激活修改方法显著提升了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入条件指导，这种静态条件策略无法适应多阶段去噪过程的动态特性，限制了模型从粗结构到精细细节的适应能力。

Method: 提出TC-LoRA框架，使用超网络基于时间和用户条件实时生成LoRA适配器，直接调节冻结主干网络的权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。

Result: 在多个数据领域的实验中，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提升了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种新范式，通过更深层次的功能性权重适配来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法能有效让视觉语言模型生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功实现了对无限视觉输入的实时稳定理解，其SFT策略不仅提升了流式处理能力，还增强了通用VQA能力，无需特定任务的微调。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型推理能力和局部搜索的方法ConPoSe，用于选择多机器人协作推运物体时的接触点，解决了传统分析方法在机器人和物体尺寸增加时组合爆炸的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在杂乱环境中进行多机器人协作物体运输时，传统分析方法在机器人数目和物体尺寸增加时面临组合爆炸问题，限制了可扩展性。受人类依靠常识推理进行协作运输的启发，希望利用大语言模型的推理能力来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合大语言模型的推理能力和局部搜索，提出ConPoSe方法进行接触点选择。该方法首先利用LLM进行初始推理，然后通过局部搜索优化接触点选择。

Result: ConPoSe成功为长方体、圆柱体和T形等多种形状的物体选择了合适的接触点。相比分析方法，在机器人数目和物体尺寸增加时具有更好的可扩展性，并且优于纯基于LLM的选择方法。

Conclusion: 将大语言模型的推理能力与局部搜索相结合，能够有效解决多机器人协作推运物体时的接触点选择问题，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in
various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In
cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects
that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which
only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact
points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this
selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially
with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by
how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose
combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search
to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for
contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a
variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate
that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the
analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

Conclusion: Point and Go模式切换通过更直观的动作空间设计，有效改善了轮椅机械臂的操作体验和性能。

Abstract: Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of
wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has
several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate
translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that
hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates
the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action
space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping
motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the
robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive `point and go'
translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like
movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines
position control with a refined end-effector oriented frame that provides
precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified
its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user
study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the
art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced
completion times by 31\%, pauses by 41\%, and mode switches by 33\%, while
receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.

Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability
to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant
challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a
system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high
speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses
external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned
residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive
control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous
set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return
objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real
world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and
exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with
varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally
with human players.

Method: 从演示曲线导出距离场，产生两个互补控制原语：沿专家轨迹的推进流和纠正偏差的吸引流，组合成可控的非参数向量场

Conclusion: GPI为机器人模仿学习提供了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的生成方法替代方案

Abstract: We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks
imitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than
collections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance
fields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression
flow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that
corrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric
vector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples
metric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across
low-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI
naturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as
separate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through
simple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on
real robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher
success rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster,
requiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations. These results
establish GPI as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
generative approaches for robotic imitation learning. Project website:

Abstract: From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made
remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However,
the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on
stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either
confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking
human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few
standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on
humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and
diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety
involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction,
locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient
human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates
high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile
inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k
trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad
categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy
learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and
limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we
introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to
seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive
performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy
learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend
to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the
groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world
scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are
made publicly available on our project website.

Conclusion: 该框架能够直接从物理接触推断人类意图，实现实时运动校正，为人机协作提供了可靠且高效的运动规划解决方案

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires robots to adapt their motions to
human intent to ensure safe and efficient cooperation in shared spaces.
Although large language models (LLMs) provide high-level reasoning for
inferring human intent, their application to reliable motion planning in HRC
remains challenging. Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is intuitive but
often relies on continuous kinesthetic guidance, which imposes burdens on
operators. To address these challenges, a contact-informed adaptive
motion-planning framework is introduced to infer human intent directly from
physical contact and employ the inferred intent for online motion correction in
HRC. First, an optimization-based force estimation method is proposed to infer
human-intended contact forces and locations from joint torque measurements and
a robot dynamics model, thereby reducing cost and installation complexity while
enabling whole-body sensitivity. Then, a torque-based contact detection
mechanism with link-level localization is introduced to reduce the optimization
search space and to enable real-time estimation. Subsequently, a
contact-informed adaptive motion planner is developed to infer human intent
from contacts and to replan robot motion online, while maintaining smoothness
and adapting to human corrections. Finally, experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator
are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed force estimation
method and the effectiveness of the contact-informed adaptive motion planner
under perception uncertainty in HRC.

Conclusion: 该POMDP框架结合贝叶斯网络的方法有效提升了深空任务中自主科学操作的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental
uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations. To support autonomous
science operations in communication-constrained environments, we present a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework that adaptively
sequences spacecraft science instruments. We integrate a Bayesian network into
the POMDP observation space to manage the high-dimensional and uncertain
measurements typical of astrobiology missions. This network compactly encodes
dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and
computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are
computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly
validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life
Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network
structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our
method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps),
evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample
accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by
nearly 40%

Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要从原始像素中提取任务相关结构，导致探索效率低下。智能探索在视觉控制任务中仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 使用预训练VLM从文本任务描述生成物体中心视觉概念作为弱监督信号，训练策略通过辅助目标重建这些概念，将重建准确度作为内在奖励指导探索。

Result: 在五个模拟视觉操作任务中实现高效、有针对性的探索，对噪声VLM预测保持鲁棒性，在真实世界Franka机械臂上达到80%成功率。

Conclusion: CDE通过概念驱动探索有效解决了视觉RL中的探索挑战，实现了从模拟到真实世界的成功迁移。

Abstract: Intelligent exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL), especially in visual control tasks. Unlike low-dimensional
state-based RL, visual RL must extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels,
making exploration inefficient. We propose Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE),
which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate
object-centric visual concepts from textual task descriptions as weak,
potentially noisy supervisory signals. Rather than directly conditioning on
these noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an
auxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to
guide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes
these concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing
dependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging
simulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted
exploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions. Finally, we
demonstrate real-world transfer by deploying CDE on a Franka Research 3 arm,
attaining an 80\% success rate in a real-world manipulation task.

Conclusion: 水平平移和三个旋转参数在一般运动下可观测，垂直平移不可观测；发布了首个结合IMU、2D里程计和原始GNSS测量的开源数据集。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of intrinsic (odometer scaling factors) and extrinsic
parameters (IMU-odometer translation and rotation) is essential for autonomous
ground vehicle localization. Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on
positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their
observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly
coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS
measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable
factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and
ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal
translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion,
while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world
experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over
state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer
positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error
of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent
improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source
dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both
rover and base stations.

Abstract: In-Hand Manipulation, as many other dexterous tasks, remains a difficult
challenge in robotics by combining complex dynamic systems with the capability
to control and manoeuvre various objects using its actuators. This work
presents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement
Learning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is
capable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts
of both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained
policy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory
evaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the
performance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.
To fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated
and under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for
a given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for
generalization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both
the policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and
additionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the
same task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a
policy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid
framework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test
cases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement
comes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the
complexity of trajectory evaluation.

Conclusion: DeePC框架为3D软体机器人提供了一种有效的动态控制解决方案，展示了其在处理复杂非线性系统方面的优势，为软体机器人控制开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet
achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their
inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive
Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses
explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While
DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots
remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic
systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally
validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.
Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing
backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength
and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,
we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension
reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory
tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based
controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,
highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft
robots.

Abstract: This paper presents the classification of a general quadric into an
axisymmetric quadric (AQ) and the solution to the problem of the proximity of a
given point to an AQ. The problem of proximity in $R^3$ is reduced to the same
in $R^2$, which is not found in the literature. A new method to solve the
problem in $R^2$ is used based on the geometrical properties of the conics,
such as sub-normal, length of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope and
radius. Furthermore, the problem in $R^2$ is categorised into two and three
more sub-cases for parabola and ellipse/hyperbola, respectively, depending on
the location of the point, which is a novel approach as per the authors'
knowledge. The proposed method is suitable for implementation in a common
programming language, such as C and proved to be faster than a commercial
library, namely, Bullet.

Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion
in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of
applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the
autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by
the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent
from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can
accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the
intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper
focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates
both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with
event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data
collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D视频世界模型缺乏几何和空间推理能力，无法准确捕捉3D世界的物理结构，限制了在机器人操作任务中的应用。

Method: 提出iMoWM模型和MMTokenizer方法，将多模态输入统一为紧凑的token表示，在保持高效的同时整合丰富的物理信息，并利用预训练的VideoGPT模型。

Conclusion: 多模态世界建模对于机器人操作任务具有显著优势，iMoWM通过整合几何和空间信息有效提升了世界模型的性能和应用价值。

Abstract: Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as
they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive
progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often
lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the
physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce
iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth
maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions.
To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional
information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a
compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale
pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating
richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not
only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an
effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and
facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of
multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation. Homepage:

TL;DR: 使用机器学习分析人类对机器人连续错误的行为反应，实现93.5%的错误检测准确率和84.1%的连续故障分类准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人融入社会，检测机器人错误对于有效的人机交互至关重要。人类对机器人错误的反应会随着连续失败而加剧，从困惑到明显沮丧，这些反应可以揭示连续故障

Method: 在26名参与者与出现连续对话错误的机器人互动研究中，从视频数据中提取行为特征，为个体用户训练机器学习模型

Result: 最佳模型在检测错误方面达到93.5%的准确率，在分类连续故障方面达到84.1%的准确率

Conclusion: 对人类反应进展进行建模可以增强错误检测能力，并更好地理解人机交互中的连续交互故障

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
in HRI.

Motivation: 视觉教学-重复导航是移动机器人在未知环境中部署的直接解决方案，但由于环境变化和动态物体的存在，鲁棒的轨迹重复导航仍然面临挑战。

Method: 系统包含三个主要部分：1）使用拓扑-度量图表示关键帧，支持扩展新观测；2）通过关键帧聚类实现视觉帧到局部地图的匹配策略；3）构建长期目标管理算法和无地图局部轨迹控制优化算法。

Result: 在移动平台上进行的广泛实验表明，该系统在鲁棒性和有效性方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的视觉教学-重复导航系统能够有效应对环境变化和动态障碍物，实现了更鲁棒和有效的轨迹重复导航性能。

Abstract: Visual Teach-and-Repeat Navigation is a direct solution for mobile robot to
be deployed in unknown environments. However, robust trajectory repeat
navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic
objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation
system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching
and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the
recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be
further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates
the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place
recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using
frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate
similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based
on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal
persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is
constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental
changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local
trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively
experiments are conducted on our mobile platform. The results demonstrate that
our system is superior to the baselines in terms of robustness and
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，让机器人能够从受限专家的演示中学习到比演示本身更优的策略，通过推断状态奖励信号和自标注未知状态奖励来实现超越直接模仿的学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的演示学习接口（如运动教学、操纵杆控制等）限制了专家展示最优行为的能力，导致收集的演示数据产生次优策略。需要让机器人能够学习比受限专家演示更好的策略。

Method: 使用演示推断仅基于状态的任务进度奖励信号，通过时间插值为未知状态自标注奖励，让智能体探索比演示更短更高效的轨迹。

Result: 在样本效率和任务完成时间上都优于常见的模仿学习方法，在真实WidowX机械臂上完成任务仅需12秒，比行为克隆快10倍。

Conclusion: 通过超越直接模仿专家动作，允许探索更高效轨迹的方法，能够从受限专家的演示中学习到更好的策略。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks
using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and
sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's
ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup
restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic
arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional
space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to
suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can
a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained
expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of
expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the
demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress,
and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our
approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and
task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12
seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on
https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .

Motivation: 解决多机器人导航在未知、结构受限、GPS受限环境中的全局战略预见与局部战术敏捷之间的基本权衡问题。集中式方法通信开销大，分布式方法缺乏全局意识易陷入死锁。

Method: 分层框架：战略层通过机会性相遇交换轻量拓扑地图，形成涌现全局意识；战术层基于局部度量信息，采用基于采样的逃逸点策略解决时空冲突。

Result: 大量仿真和真实实验表明，在通信受限且拓扑结构复杂的环境中，系统在成功率和效率方面显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该去中心化分层框架成功平衡了战略预见和战术敏捷，在复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied
environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic
foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication.
Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high
communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the
broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we
propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that
achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified
coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange
lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process
fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient,
trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires
the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a
sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts
by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently
satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive
simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system
significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in
communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.

Motivation: 集中式多机器人轨迹优化在狭窄空间中能生成更平滑的轨迹，但计算复杂度随机器人数量增加而急剧上升，难以扩展到大规模群体。

Method: 提出Flow-Opt方法：1) 使用增强扩散变换器的流匹配模型作为生成模型；2) 开发带有神经网络预测初始化的自定义安全过滤器求解器；3) 初始化网络通过自监督训练利用求解器的可微性。

Result: 在杂乱环境中生成数十个机器人的轨迹仅需几十毫秒，比现有集中式优化方法快数倍，比基于扩散模型的基线方法快几个数量级；支持批量处理，可在不到一秒内解决数十个问题实例；能生成多样化的轨迹集合。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率、批量处理能力和轨迹多样性方面均优于现有方法，为大规模多机器人轨迹规划提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots
allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother
trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is
often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this
paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the
computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization.
Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to
sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned
Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We
propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with
permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model.
We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that
predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the
SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we
show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered
environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than
existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also
generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing
baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can
be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction
of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach
provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of
trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture
different collision-avoidance behaviors.

TL;DR: 提出一种仅使用4个电机的轻量化(311g)假肢手，通过单轴拇指和优化拇指位置实现基本抓握姿势和手内操作(精确抓握与侧向抓握之间的重新定向)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动假肢手需要轻量化以减少用户负担，外形像人手以美观，电机内置以保护免受损坏和污垢。除了执行日常活动的能力外，这些特性对于日常使用至关重要。手内操作对于执行日常活动是必要的，但现有方法需要过多电机或复杂机制。

Method: 结合单轴拇指和优化的拇指定位，仅使用四个电机在轻量化假肢手中实现基本姿势和手内操作(精确抓握与侧向抓握之间的重新定向)。

Result: 使用各种宽度(5-30mm)和形状(圆柱体和棱柱)的原始物体进行实验验证，重新定向任务的成功率为90-100%。该手能够执行印章盖章和USB设备插入，以及旋转操作螺丝刀。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了仅使用四个电机的轻量化假肢手，能够完成基本抓握和手内操作任务，验证了其在日常活动中的实用性。

Abstract: Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the
user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and have motors inside to
protect them from damage and dirt. In addition to the ability to perform daily
activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand
manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning
between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as
reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as
screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve
static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many
motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex
mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor
placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.
Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning
to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation
between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight
(311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of
various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success
rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks. The hand performed seal stamping and
USB device insertion, as well as rotation to operate a screwdriver.

Abstract: Seamless loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires robots to
leverage autonomous exploration alongside whole-body control for physical
interaction. In this work, we introduce HANDO (Hierarchical Autonomous
Navigation and Dexterous Omni-loco-manipulation), a two-layer framework
designed for legged robots equipped with manipulators to perform human-centered
mobile manipulation tasks. The first layer utilizes a goal-conditioned
autonomous exploration policy to guide the robot to semantically specified
targets, such as a black office chair in a dynamic environment. The second
layer employs a unified whole-body loco-manipulation policy to coordinate the
arm and legs for precise interaction tasks-for example, handing a drink to a
person seated on the chair. We have conducted an initial deployment of the
navigation module, and will continue to pursue finer-grained deployment of
whole-body loco-manipulation.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单个人工演示快速生成平滑、接近最优的避障轨迹，为运动规划提供了高效的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal
trajectories. However, it often requires either large training datasets or
costly collection of human demonstrations. This work proposes an alternative
approach that quickly generates smooth, near-optimal collision-free 3D
Cartesian trajectories from a single artificial demonstration. The
demonstration is encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively
reshaped using policy-based reinforcement learning to create a diverse
trajectory dataset for varying obstacle configurations. This dataset is used to
train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the
obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and
outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is
validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect
baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory
length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different
obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions. Videos and the implementation

Abstract: Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key
challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full
spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial
adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally
for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial
inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate
challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by
manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical
weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an
effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success
rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a
six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary
algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the
development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks,
and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.

TL;DR: FIPER是一个用于生成式模仿学习策略的运行时失败预测框架，无需失败数据，通过检测分布外观察和动作不确定性来预测失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式模仿学习虽然能让机器人执行复杂任务，但分布偏移和动作误差累积仍会导致不可预测的不安全行为，需要运行时失败预测来确保在人类环境和安全关键场景中的部署安全。

Method: FIPER通过随机网络蒸馏检测策略嵌入空间中的分布外观察，并使用新颖的动作块熵分数测量生成动作的不确定性，通过符合预测校准这两个失败预测指标，在短时间窗口内聚合超过阈值时触发失败警报。

Result: 在五个仿真和真实环境中的评估表明，FIPER能更好地区分实际失败与良性分布外情况，比现有方法更准确、更早地预测失败。

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成式机器人策略提供了更可解释和更安全的运行时失败预测方法，是迈向更安全机器人部署的重要一步。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graphs (DSGs) provide a structured representation of

capture stochastic dynamics, partial observability, and multi-agent activity.
These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under
uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source
framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object
dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale. This setup enables the
study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and
emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate
realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of
belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured
representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective
tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决血管内手术中机器人导丝导航的建模和控制挑战，提高导航精度和安全性。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的端到端模仿学习框架，包含目标条件、相对动作输出和自动对比剂注射，在36种不同血管几何结构上进行训练。

Result: 在未见过的血管几何结构上，模型能够自主将机器人尖端导航至动脉瘤位置，成功率达到83%，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现可泛化的软体机器人导丝导航，为血管内手术自动化提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,
outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline
studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection
choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合冲击缓解因子(IMF)和对抗运动先验(AMP)的方法，使强化学习策略能够同时学习动物的显性运动轨迹和隐性被动动力学，实现了高达32%的能源效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法主要捕捉动物的显性步态模式，但忽略了隐性的被动动力学，而动物正是通过被动动力学实现节能运动的。

Method: 将基于物理信息的冲击缓解因子(IMF)作为奖励项整合到对抗运动先验(AMP)和强化学习中，使策略能够学习显性运动轨迹和隐性被动动态。

Result: 在AMP和手工设计奖励结构中都实现了高达32%的运输成本(CoT)能源效率改进。

Conclusion: 通过整合IMF与AMP，成功弥补了现有方法在捕捉动物隐性被动动力学方面的不足，显著提升了机器人的能源效率。

Abstract: Animals achieve energy-efficient locomotion by their implicit passive
dynamics, a marvel that has captivated roboticists for decades.Recently,
methods incorporated Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promising progress to replicate Animals' naturalistic motion.
However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit
kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive
dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by
Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a
robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our
approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from
animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy
efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport
(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.

Conclusion: AIMAPP提供了一个生物启发的、模块化的解决方案，可在非结构化环境中实现可扩展的自监督导航。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to
simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying
on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired,
Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning
(AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within
a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses
topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide
behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns
state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free
Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We
implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and
robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It
operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports
both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We
demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments
against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's
adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor
noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable,
self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at

TL;DR: 提出EDS框架，通过基于能量的模型在推理时动态引导LLM隐藏状态，同时提高安全性和降低错误拒绝率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对齐技术只关注有害提示的安全性，导致LLM变得过度谨慎，拒绝响应良性提示，需要同时提升安全性并减少错误拒绝

Method: 训练轻量级外部能量模型，将LLM内部激活映射到能量景观，使用能量函数梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域

Result: 在ORB-H基准上，合规率从57.3%提升到82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能，显著降低错误拒绝率

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，使LLM能够同时实现低错误拒绝率和高安全性，将行为控制与核心知识解耦

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

TL;DR: WILSON是一个后处理诊断套件，用于检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的答案变化问题，如RAG输出翻转、微调侵蚀预训练不变性等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在答案对无害编辑敏感的问题，这违反了预期的不变性，破坏了持续集成，并迫使团队在安全性和速度之间做出权衡。

Method: WILSON通过简单的循环和重排序检查内部表示来生成系统信号，结合无逆曲率映射和激活级交换子来标记重排序风险。

Result: WILSON信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，并能输出阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用。

Conclusion: WILSON有助于预测故障并批准安全优化，从而在不改变模型架构或训练的情况下同时提高可靠性和吞吐量。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当，特别是在资源有限地区问题更为严重。

Method: 提出RareNet，基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据识别致病基因，可作为独立方法或与其他基因优先排序方法的预处理/后处理过滤器。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂基因分析，为缺乏先进基因组基础设施的弱势群体提供了民主化的诊断解决方案。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，会导致分布偏移，现有实例归一化技术无法处理实例内的分布偏移，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了两种点级方法：LD通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入和输出的内部分布来消除内部差异；LCD使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中与各种骨干模型结合评估，验证了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能够有效处理时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: LeFCert为语言赋能基础模型的少样本分类提供了首个可证明鲁棒的解决方案，在保持高效的同时显著提升了对抗投毒攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 高维数据可视化通常使用二维散点图，但评估这些图的准确性具有挑战性。常用的质量指标如归一化应力和KL散度对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会实质改变投影的性质。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究缩放对应力和KL散度的影响，引入一种简单技术使这两个指标对缩放不变，并在小型基准测试中验证其有效性。

Result: 研究表明缩放会显著改变应力和KL散度的值，影响降维技术的评估。提出的方法能够准确捕捉预期行为。

Conclusion: 需要使可视化质量指标对缩放不变，以确保降维技术评估的公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过分类辅助机制和重新设计的分解架构，有效提升了线性模型的预测性能，在固定超参数设置下达到了最先进的预测精度。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for

Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这一假设并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量具有高相似性但连续性差，高频分量则连续性高但相似性差。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：直接重用低频分量特征，使用二阶Hermite插值器预测高频分量。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)，将内存占用减少99%。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存方法通过分别处理不同频率分量的特性，有效解决了扩散变换器推理成本高的问题，同时大幅减少了内存占用。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用价值，基于自适应算法的注意力机制设计方法为开发具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的无线基础模型提供了关键思路。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Motivation: 开发一种自监督学习范式，无需人工标注就能学习有意义的表示，通过让模型识别同一实例的不同变换视图来捕捉实例的内在特征。

Method: 对每个数据实例应用随机变换生成两个不同的视图，训练模型将这些视图识别为同一类别，从而学习对变换不变的表示。

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP)方法，通过对称化保护属性干预下的符合度分数，在保持边际覆盖性质的同时实现反事实公平的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然点预测器的反事实公平性已有研究，但预测集的反事实公平性（在不确定性下进行公平决策的关键）仍未充分探索。同时，保形预测能提供有效的预测集但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预下的符合度分数来开发CF-CP方法，该方法无需重新训练即可实现反事实公平的预测集。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的回归和分类任务中，CF-CP实现了期望的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加满足了目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP为反事实公平的不确定性量化提供了一种简单、无需训练的途径。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: 本文为大型语言模型推理时内部状态修改技术提供了理论基础，解释了这些干预措施如何从Transformer架构的基本计算中产生，并提出了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的原则性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制技术虽然有效，但多基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些通过修改内部激活状态或权重矩阵来控制模型行为的技术提供理论基础。

Method: 基于Dherin等人关于提示影响可数学映射为隐式权重更新的发现，将这一理论推广到深度多块Transformer架构。通过分析用户提示中信息如何通过权重向量和权重矩阵在内部表示和组合，推导出将信息压缩为token无关的思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 提出的思想向量和思想矩阵为现有的基于向量和矩阵的模型编辑技术提供了理论解释，并提供了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的直接计算方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为模型编辑技术建立了理论基础，揭示了Transformer架构中信息表示和组合的内在机制，为更原则性的模型控制方法提供了指导。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

Motivation: 大型黑盒模型虽然能处理复杂数据关系，但缺乏可解释性，在高风险应用中存在信任问题。需要开发能够解释预测过程的AI方法。

Method: 使用SHAP分析量化特征对预测的贡献，然后对SHAP值进行聚类，识别样本获得相同预测的不同原因路径。提出了多分类瀑布图的新泛化方法。

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究验证了该方法，能够有效识别样本预测的多种原因路径，增强了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类是一种有效的可解释AI方法，能够揭示黑盒模型预测背后的多种决策路径，提高模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

TL;DR: 提出一个双方法框架，通过代理模型解释和频谱可预测性分析来解决复杂时间序列集成模型的透明度和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖AutoML系统生成的复杂集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要解决准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1) 使用LightGBM训练代理模型来模拟AutoGluon的时间序列预测，实现稳定的SHAP特征归因；2) 集成频谱可预测性分析，通过比较时间序列与纯噪声基准的频谱可预测性来量化固有可预测性。

Result: 在M5数据集上的实证评估显示，更高的频谱可预测性不仅与改进的预测准确性强相关，还与代理模型和原始预测模型之间的更高保真度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供了可解释的实例级解释，同时为用户提供了可预测性指标，作为预测及其解释的可靠性指标。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子设计中上下文学习效果有限的问题，现有数据库如ChEMBL包含数百万生物测定数据，但每个属性的标记数据仍然稀缺。

Method: 使用演示条件扩散模型，通过少量分子-评分示例指导去噪Transformer生成符合目标属性的分子；开发新的分子分词器Node Pair Encoding，在基序级别表示分子，节点数减少5.5倍；在包含数百万上下文任务的数据集上预训练7亿参数模型。

Result: 在6个类别33个设计任务中，DemoDiff匹配或超越大100-1000倍的语言模型，平均排名3.63，优于领域特定方法的5.25-10.20。

Conclusion: DemoDiff作为上下文分子设计的分子基础模型，在分子设计任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理混合类型表格数据时存在语义信息丢失和可解释性不足的问题，在网络安全、金融欺诈检测和医疗等高风险领域需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将异常检测重构为特征级条件重建问题，为每个特征训练专门的随机森林模型，结合调整后的Gower距离进行单元格级评分，并使用不确定性加权平均聚合为行级异常分数。

Result: 在15个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，RFOD在检测准确性上持续优于现有最先进方法，同时在混合类型表格数据上表现出更好的鲁棒性、可扩展性和可解释性。

Conclusion: RFOD框架有效解决了混合类型表格数据异常检测中的语义保持和可解释性问题，为高风险领域提供了更可靠的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型虽然预测准确率高，但缺乏可证明的风险或可靠性保证，这在高风险应用中至关重要。传统的保形风险控制仅关注期望损失，无法处理对尾部风险敏感的实际应用。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险类别的方法，包括条件风险价值等尾部风险度量；引入了端到端的保形风险训练，在模型训练或微调过程中通过保形OCE风险控制进行反向传播。

Result: 该方法在控制分类器假阴性率和电池存储操作中的金融风险等应用中，相比后处理方法显著提高了平均性能，同时保持可证明的风险保证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险保证，特别是针对尾部风险，并通过端到端训练改善了平均性能，适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化客户端内和客户端间的细粒度跨样本记忆化风险，揭示了FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FL记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的更微妙风险。集中式学习的细粒度记忆化评估方法无法直接应用于FL，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出了一个框架，通过在所有客户端上进行细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来量化FL中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化。进行了两项研究：测量跨客户端的微妙记忆化，以及检查影响记忆化的关键因素。

Result: 发现FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据比客户端间数据更多，记忆化受到训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: FL模型存在记忆化风险，特别是客户端内数据更容易被记忆，记忆化程度受多种训练和推理因素影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，梯度在大部分区域为零，在量化阈值处未定义。现有方法如STE缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出LOTION框架，通过无偏随机舍入噪声的期望来近似量化损失表面，将原始量化损失替换为平滑版本，使标准优化器能够收敛到局部最小值。

Result: 实验证明该方法在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上优于标准QAT（量化感知训练）。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有理论保证的量化优化框架，能够保持原始量化损失的全局最小值，并在实践中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织的挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个问题而忽略另一个。

Method: 两阶段方法：使用带有空间先验的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学领域的真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder一致地改善了效应估计，扩展了SpaCE基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用PPO强化学习算法，在虚拟成像环境中优化CT采集和重建参数，以最大化肝脏病灶的可检测性指数。

Result: 强化学习方法在测试案例中达到了全局最大d'值，比穷举搜索减少了79.7%的计算步骤。

Conclusion: 虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合的方法在CT协议优化中具有高效性和准确性，为CT协议管理提供了新途径。

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境中测试，相似动态环境下无性能损失，非相似环境下始终优于朴素迁移方法。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强RL策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Method: 研究了两种主要的进程内方法：顺序拼接和并行缓存，并引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线方法。顺序拼接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现优异，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更好但更容易受到干扰。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了进程内结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

*Vaibhav Jain,Gerrit Grossmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过增强观测空间提供LLM生成动作建议的框架，让RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，在稀疏奖励环境中显著提升训练效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL在稀疏奖励环境中探索效率低，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法要么强制RL策略遵循LLM建议，要么将其直接纳入奖励函数，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过增强观测空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，RL智能体可以学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力，同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中，LLM指导的益处随任务难度增加而提升。在最复杂环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的规划能力来加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，无需修改现有RL算法，实现了软约束下的有效指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近的三个主要挑战：(i)每个目标函数需要从头训练新模型；(ii)性能对架构和超参数高度敏感；(iii)模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 基于基函数预训练的可重用初始化框架：首先训练基神经网络逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后使用学习到的参数初始化复杂目标函数的网络，并引入域映射机制将任意域输入转换到参考域。

Result: 在一维和二维设置中的大量数值实验显示，该方法在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经网络函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够根据公共次优性差距自适应地调整探索策略，数值实验验证了Θ(√T)的速率和算法的有效性。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Motivation: 为了解决参数化时间依赖偏微分方程中高效学习物理一致解算子的需求，结合深度算子网络和物理信息神经网络的优点，开发一个更准确和高效的框架。

Method: 采用DeepONet风格的分支-主干架构，子网络实例化为有理KAN模块，通过PDE残差(PINN风格)损失来强制物理一致性。

Result: 在ν=0.01的Burgers方程上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet将平均相对L²误差降低了约48%，在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准测试中达到了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习算子，结果与高保真解高度匹配，证明了其在参数化时间依赖PDEs中快速预测的有效性。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Result: 提供了TAPAS数据集的创建文档，建立了攻击性能基准，并规划了未来工作方向。

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集填补了AI研究LWE攻击的数据空白，有望加速后量子密码学领域的AI研究进展。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略并假设模态输入始终可靠，这在真实学习环境中很少见，需要更稳健的方法

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块用于动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步的模态分配基于置信度的权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测来强制时间一致性

Result: 在教育子集IEMOCAP和MOSEI上评估，重新标注了困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧等情感，取得了最先进的性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉情感转换并自适应地优先考虑可靠信号，非常适合部署在实时学习系统中

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解多数类偏见倾向，同时保留数据集中的有价值信息，在长尾分类问题上表现优异。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 强化学习框架能够有效管理边缘资源，在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的3D重建。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，以及更稳健、公平的预后模型来解决现有解决方案的局限性。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自监督对比学习（CL）与仅负样本监督对比学习（NSCL）在表示层面的对齐性，证明了它们在表示相似性矩阵上保持接近，但参数空间会随时间指数级发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但尚不清楚两者在训练过程中的表示层面是否始终保持对齐。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在共享随机性（相同初始化、批次和增强）下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析其表示相似性矩阵的接近程度，并推导出CKA和RSA等对齐度量的高概率保证。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，且对齐度随类别数增加、温度升高而增强，但参数空间会随时间指数级发散。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的原则性桥梁，其与CL的表示层面对齐性随规模扩大而增强，但参数层面的耦合不稳定。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为

Method: ATM通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重建贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持优秀重建质量

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的稀疏分解方法来分析人类视觉皮层中腹侧、背侧和外侧通路的表征差异，并开发了稀疏成分对齐（SCA）方法来更精确地测量大脑与深度神经网络之间的表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在单任务上训练的深度神经网络能够很好地建模整个视觉系统，尽管人类视觉皮层中的不同通路被认为执行不同的功能过程。

Method: 使用稀疏分解方法识别每个视觉通路中的主要成分，并开发了稀疏成分对齐（SCA）方法来测量大脑与DNNs之间的表征对齐。

Result: 发现腹侧通路对脸孔、地点、身体、文字和食物有选择性；外侧通路对社会互动、暗示运动和手部动作有选择性；背侧通路的成分较难解释。标准视觉DNNs与腹侧通路的对齐度高于背侧或外侧通路。

Conclusion: SCA方法能够比传统群体水平几何方法更精确地揭示大脑与机器视觉系统之间的表征对齐差异，为理解两个系统的潜在神经调谐轴提供了敏感测量。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Result: 在两个合成测试案例和一个复杂的激光点火火箭燃烧器模拟应用中，BPMI在所有实验中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: BPMI在固定计算预算下实现了更高的预测精度，为多保真度模拟提供了有效的主动学习策略

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

*Haolin Liu,Chen-Yu Wei,Julian Zimmert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Dig-DEC，一种基于信息增益的模型无关决策估计系数，用于结构化观测决策问题。该方法移除了乐观主义，在对抗性环境中表现更好，并在混合MDP中实现了首个模型无关的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法存在遗憾界差距，且只能处理随机环境。需要一种既能处理对抗性环境又能缩小遗憾界差距的新方法。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，通过纯信息增益驱动探索，移除乐观主义。改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC始终不大于乐观DEC，在某些情况下更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个模型无关遗憾界。改进的估计器将遗憾界从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}（在线）和从T^{5/6}到T^{7/9}（离线）。在贝尔曼完备MDP中，遗憾界从T^{2/3}提升到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC是一种有效的模型无关方法，能够处理对抗性环境，并在多个场景下显著改善了遗憾界，首次在贝尔曼完备MDP中达到与乐观方法相当的性能。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

TL;DR: 提出了ACPO框架来解决RLVR中探索与利用不平衡的问题，通过难度感知课程和因子化奖励系统提升推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在平衡探索与利用方面存在困难，导致中间步骤信用分配不准确和过早熵崩溃，限制了模型性能

Method: ACPO框架包含轨迹语义分割和基于归因的表征来动态调节策略熵，以及因子化奖励系统来精确量化推理步骤的层次贡献

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等挑战性基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: ACPO通过改进探索和利用的平衡，有效解决了RLVR中的关键问题，提升了复杂推理能力

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信边界项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来理解算法的动态行为。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，不确定性对应分量频率，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器。

Result: 证明了UCB算法的置信边界项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益，该增益与访问次数的平方根成反比，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态边界。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Motivation: 解决车联网中由于数据包碰撞和车辆速度相关的信道不确定性导致的半持续调度信息年龄恶化问题。

Method: 建立了受车辆速度、车辆密度和资源预留间隔影响的AoI计算模型，设计了基于LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方案，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置，DDPG通过状态空间和奖励函数进行指导。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后实现了更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG相结合的双路径优化方案能有效解决车联网中的AoI问题，LLM提供快速优化能力，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对小地球数据的时空预测方法，通过量化时空模式并利用表格基础模型实现跨场景的准确预测，相比传统方法具有更好的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 小地球数据具有有限的短期监测变异性，表现出时空相关性，传统深度学习模型需要针对不同场景进行特定训练，而基础模型存在对预训练分布全局均值的预测偏差问题。

Method: 通过表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景的对比实验中，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）实现了更优的准确性，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为小地球数据的时空预测提供了一种简单而稳健的解决方案，能够有效克服传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在处理多尺度问题时面临挑战，静态域分解方法需要大量超参数调优且容易陷入局部最小值。AB-PINNs旨在通过动态域分解来更好地捕捉多尺度特征。

Method: 基于经典网格细化技术，在训练过程中动态修改域分解：1）现有子域自适应调整以适应解的特征；2）在高残差损失区域引入新子域；3）不同子域学习捕捉解的不同尺度。

Result: AB-PINNs在多种复杂多尺度偏微分方程求解中表现出有效性，能够减少超参数调优需求并防止收敛到不希望的局部最小值。

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适用于多尺度问题，通过动态调整子域来增强表达能力并提高训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的测试时优化范式MATT，通过置信度引导的多推理路径生成来提升CTR模型的预测性能，特别是在处理低频特征组合时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在训练阶段优化CTR模型，忽视了推理阶段的优化机会。低频特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠的输出。

Method: 1. 使用分层概率哈希方法量化特征组合的置信度；2. 以置信度为采样概率，通过迭代采样生成多个实例特定的推理路径；3. 聚合多个路径的预测分数进行鲁棒预测。

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EDL方法使用静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的狄利克雷先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，改善了不确定性校准、预测准确度以及基于置信度的样本拒绝后的性能保持。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态元学习实现了更好的不确定性建模，相比固定先验方法具有更强的适应性。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，展示了其作为时间序列学习框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注改进模型架构，而忽视了文本属性图数据本身的系统性优化。实证研究表明，传统GNN和LLM增强的GNN在稀疏性、噪声和不平衡等九种代表性场景下性能显著下降，表明图质量是关键的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 验证了数据中心的质量优化对于可靠的文本属性图和鲁棒的图学习至关重要。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够内在地学习正则化特性，挑战了传统显式正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

TL;DR: FedL2T是一个个性化的联邦学习框架，通过双教师知识蒸馏策略解决癫痫预测中患者间差异性问题，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量标注EEG数据，但数据获取困难且涉及隐私问题。现有联邦学习方法在异构客户端设置下性能不佳，需要解决患者间差异性带来的挑战。

Method: 提出FedL2T框架，采用双教师知识蒸馏策略：每个客户端同时学习全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型；使用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和中间特征表示；引入近端正则化项约束个性化模型更新。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T始终优于最先进的FL方法，特别是在低标签条件下表现突出；具有快速稳定收敛特性，减少通信轮次和开销。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景中的癫痫预测提供了一个可靠且个性化的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出Constraints-of-Thought框架，通过(intent, constraint)对结构化表示引导MCTS搜索，在复杂多步规划中提高LLM的约束对齐性和规划效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等扩展搜索空间但常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，LLM难以确保规划与用户意图对齐并满足符号约束

Method: 将推理步骤表示为(intent, constraint)对，作为结构化先验集成到MCTS中，约束剪枝不可行分支并引导探索语义有效动作

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域优于基线方法，获得更高准确率和更强结构对齐性

Conclusion: Const-of-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLM能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域自适应的规划

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

TL;DR: PlatformX是一个完全自动化的硬件感知神经架构搜索框架，通过集成能量驱动的搜索空间、可转移的核级能量预测器、帕累托多目标搜索算法和高分辨率运行时能量分析系统，显著降低了搜索开销，在移动平台上实现了比MobileNet-V2更好的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法由于高时间成本、大量手动分析和在不同硬件平台上可扩展性差，在实际部署中不实用。

Method: PlatformX包含四个关键组件：能量驱动搜索空间、可转移核级能量预测器、帕累托多目标搜索算法、高分辨率运行时能量分析系统。

Result: 在多个移动平台上评估显示，PlatformX显著减少搜索开销，同时保持准确性和能量保真度，识别出准确率达0.94或每次推理仅消耗0.16 mJ的模型，均优于MobileNet-V2。

Conclusion: PlatformX是一个实用且可扩展的HW-NAS框架，能够自动高效地设计适用于边缘设备的深度神经网络。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯变分学习的统一框架SQS，同时进行剪枝和低比特量化，相比现有方法实现了更高的压缩率并保持可比的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独进行权重剪枝或低比特量化，导致压缩率不理想，需要统一框架来同时优化这两种压缩技术。

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验诱导稀疏性，采用高斯混合模型建模量化权重，实现低比特精度，通过贝叶斯变分学习统一剪枝和量化。

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上的实验表明，该方法比现有方法获得更高的压缩率，同时保持可比的性能下降。

Conclusion: SQS框架有效统一了剪枝和量化，实现了更优的神经网络压缩效果，为资源受限设备部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在噪声遗忘数据集下的大语言模型遗忘问题，发现即使遗忘数据被扰动或质量较低，只要核心语义信号得以保留，遗忘方法仍能保持稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法通常假设能获得干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，但现实中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、合成改写或带有水印的，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法（RMU和NPO）进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架来分析遗忘稳健性。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动具有惊人的稳健性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘在噪声遗忘数据下仍能保持有效性，这为实际应用中的不完美遗忘数据提供了理论支持，表明遗忘机制主要依赖语义内容而非表面形式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的大模型存在注意力汇聚和值状态流失等极端token现象，这些问题会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，源于注意力与近零值状态token之间的相互强化机制。

Method: 引入VGA机制，通过直接从值向量计算数据依赖的可学习门控来调节输出，为模型提供基于值表示抑制token贡献的直接调控路径。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇聚的形成并稳定了值状态范数，带来了性能提升、鲁棒的量化保真度和增强的模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于值状态自身的门控比基于输入嵌入的门控方法更有效地解耦值和注意力分数更新，提供了一种高效执行'无操作'注意力的稳定架构机制。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器来协调可瘦身模型的分布式推理，实现动态适应异构硬件和运行时条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注静态端到端模型，忽略了动态适应异构硬件和波动运行时条件的方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器处理请求批处理和实例缩放，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比、批配置）。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在精度降至最瘦模型（70.3%）时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；还能在提高精度的同时降低平均延迟和能耗。

Conclusion: 该分层设计降低了搜索空间复杂度，减轻了对特定硬件的过拟合，平衡了效率和吞吐量。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

Motivation: 现有从头配体设计方法存在伪从头设计、有限对接建模和配体类型不灵活的局限性，需要开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架和可微分表面建模，通过结合受体-配体对接知识，利用可学习的3D点云表示精确捕捉结合细节，支持不同类型配体的定制化设计。

Result: 在9个不同场景的实验中，MagicDock相比专门用于蛋白质或分子配体设计的现有最佳方法分别实现了27.1%和11.7%的平均改进。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过创新的梯度反演和可微分表面建模方法，有效解决了从头配体设计中的关键挑战，展现出优异的性能和广泛的适用性。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型性能提升，计算需求急剧增加，导致能源消耗和环境问题日益严重。需要评估现有优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算过去十年中著名AI系统（包括大语言模型）训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的生命周期分析，考察生产和使用阶段的影响。

Result: 发现两个关键趋势：显卡生产的环境影响持续增加；ML模型训练的能耗和环境影响呈指数增长，即使采用位置转移等减排策略，优化策略无法抵消训练带来的影响，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，必须减少AI活动规模，质疑资源密集型训练的频次和规模，并在整个生命周期而非仅使用阶段考虑硬件影响。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，主要使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御效果。

Method: 系统调整和扩展通用优化技术，包括梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索，来测试12种不同的防御方法。

Result: 成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原本这些防御报告的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文所述，才能做出可靠且令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练中多种优化器都能找到接近全局最优解，本文从相反的视角出发，假设收敛到任意点，研究这种假设的后果，并与边缘稳定性现象的最新进展保持一致。

Method: 利用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，对一般半代数C^2函数进行理论分析，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出了两种增强特征值过滤的新算法。

Result: 理论分析和前馈神经网络的数值实验表明，不同优化器确实作为特征值过滤器运行，梯度下降避免尖锐最小值，SAM算法更倾向于宽盆地，新算法能有效促进更宽的最小值。

Conclusion: 优化器可以视为特征值过滤器，其超参数决定了过滤行为。标准梯度下降避免尖锐最小值，SAM算法进一步偏好宽盆地，新提出的算法能增强这种特征值过滤效果。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

Conclusion: IGCARL能有效提升DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，解决现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)

*Emilio Mastriani,Alessandro Costa,Federico Incardona,Kevin Munari,Sebastiano Spinello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在工业生产环境中，通过结合时间序列分割技术和异构集成方法，显著提升了异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多元时间序列环境中，状态变化检测对异常检测至关重要。传统方法存在时间不确定性，需要更好的技术来识别正常和异常状态之间的转换。

Method: 使用ChangeFinder等变化点检测算法进行时间序列分割作为预处理步骤，然后应用异构集成算法（如随机森林和XGBoost）进行异常检测。

Result: 通过分割预处理结合异构集成，AUC-ROC指标从0.8599（PCA和LSTM集成）显著提升到0.9760（随机森林和XGBoost集成）。

Conclusion: 时间序列分割能够减少时间模糊性，促进监督算法的学习过程，在工业异常检测中具有重要价值。未来将探索基于变化点的加权特征进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLToP CTC是一种新颖的CTC解码算法，通过帧级token剪枝显著降低了计算和内存需求，在LibriSpeech上实现了10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，同时保持WER性能几乎不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CTC-based ASR系统在资源受限环境中的计算和内存瓶颈问题，传统CTC解码器在token级操作上效率低下，占用大量处理时间。

Method: 采用帧级token剪枝策略，基于相对阈值概率动态消除每帧中的低概率token，从而减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，FLToP CTC相比标准CTC解码器实现了10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

TL;DR: BioCodec是一个受神经编解码器启发的表示学习框架，可将生物信号转换为离散标记，在多个下游任务中表现出色，特别是在低资源环境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经生理记录（如EEG）产生高维噪声时间序列数据，需要大量预处理和特征工程。现有的大规模预训练模型方法面临挑战，需要替代方案来有效解码和解释生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散标记。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号类型。

Result: BioCodec在临床诊断、睡眠生理学、语音解码和运动想象等多个下游任务中表现优异，特别是在低资源设置下。对EMG信号也适用，性能与最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号标记化提供了通用解决方案，在多个应用场景中表现竞争力，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

TL;DR: AdaPM是一种自适应训练策略，通过部分动量设计和偏置校正技术，在保持优化性能的同时显著减少动量存储的内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练中广泛使用动量来加速收敛，但动量存储带来内存挑战。需要开发内存高效的优化器。

Method: 提出非均匀动量设计：对大多数模块不使用完整动量，通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减少性能损失。

Result: 经验验证表明，该方法在动量存储上减少超过90%内存，同时保持从60M到1.5B各种语言模型的预训练效率，以及监督微调和RLHF的性能。结合二阶统计量的内存高效技术，可进一步减少95%优化器状态内存，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省超过30% GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM通过自适应部分动量策略，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低了优化器的内存需求，为大型语言模型训练提供了内存高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法在提升模型鲁棒性时往往牺牲干净数据的准确率，需要一种平衡两者性能的方法

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平性机器学习和差分隐私机器学习中，跨组隐私保护的公平性研究不足。现有方法基于平均隐私风险，可能低估组隐私风险及其差异，且最坏情况隐私风险评估方法耗时较长。

Method: 引入成员推断游戏高效审计近似最坏情况隐私风险；改进DP-SGD算法，采用自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能更准确评估和改善差分隐私机器学习中的组隐私风险公平性，为隐私保护公平性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题，提出了两种算法：一种针对有限策略类的最优后悔界，另一种针对函数逼近设置的通用算法，并给出了相应的后悔界分析和下界证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的在线学习场景中，反馈往往不是即时获得的，而是存在延迟。本文旨在解决具有对抗性延迟的上下文多臂老虎机问题，特别是在函数逼近设置下，提供有效的后悔最小化算法。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1）针对有限策略类的直接访问算法；2）针对函数逼近设置的通用算法，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机。特别分析了基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性。

Result: 获得了两种设置下的期望后悔界：有限策略类为O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))，函数逼近设置为O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))。同时证明了Ω(√(KT log|F|) + √(D log|F|))的下界。

Conclusion: 本文为具有延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，特别是在函数逼近设置下，虽然与下界存在√d_max的差距，但为这一重要问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过成对比较来估计密度的方法，将未观测的目标密度与经过温度调节的胜者密度相关联，通过分数匹配学习胜者分数，然后通过"去温度调节"来估计目标密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于专家知识获取和从人类反馈中学习，需要从成对比较中估计密度。

Method: 将目标密度与温度调节的胜者密度关联，通过分数匹配学习胜者分数，提出温度场的估计器，使用基于分数缩放的退火Langevin动力学生成样本训练扩散模型。

Result: 能够仅使用数百到数千个成对比较，学习模拟专家的复杂多元信念密度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从有限成对比较中估计复杂密度函数，为专家知识获取提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间监督和稳定优化更新，在提升领域性能的同时缓解通用能力遗忘，降低40%以上训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM领域适应中的权衡问题：提升专业领域性能往往以牺牲通用能力为代价，现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录动态Top-K token子集（包含黄金标签），Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失；设计MoClip优化器限制梯度动量旋转并基于arctan2重新缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，同时在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上缓解遗忘，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

Motivation: 当前基于知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态、预构建的知识库，存在覆盖范围不足和时间过时的问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统、可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法，通过多轮强化学习实现LLM与知识图谱的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识提取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮强化学习方法，与GraphRAG集成后在问答任务中表现出更高的准确性和知识覆盖率。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过协同进化机制有效解决了知识增强LLM的覆盖不足和时效性问题，在知识提取和下游任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性的EHR表示方法基准测试，比较了多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流三种范式，发现在不同临床场景下事件流模型表现最佳，且特征选择策略需要根据具体临床任务调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)支持临床预测的深度学习应用，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确。需要建立标准化基准来比较不同的EHR表示方法。

Method: 构建统一基准，在MIMIC-IV(ICU任务)和EHRSHOT(纵向护理)两个临床数据集上，评估多变量时间序列(Transformers、MLP、LSTM、Retain)、事件流(CLMBR、计数模型)和文本事件流(8-20B LLMs)三种表示范式，并分析基于数据缺失的特征剪枝影响。

Result: 事件流模型始终表现最佳；预训练模型如CLMBR在少样本场景下样本效率高，但给定足够数据时简单计数模型也具有竞争力；ICU预测中剪枝稀疏特征有益，而纵向任务中保留这些特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，研究结果为基于临床背景和数据机制选择EHR表示提供了实用指导，强调需要根据具体临床任务调整表示方法和特征选择策略。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: 提出了WASI方法，通过将训练限制在固定子空间来减少Transformer模型的内存使用和计算成本，同时保持与标准训练相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的应用增加，能耗和数据隐私成为重要问题。设备端学习虽然能解决这些问题，但现代神经网络的规模成为主要障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练到Transformer模型，引入权重-激活子空间迭代(WASI)方法，通过将训练限制在模型关键信息所在的固定子空间来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确性的同时，将内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)减少高达2倍。在树莓派5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了设备端训练的内存和计算瓶颈，为在资源受限设备上部署Transformer模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Result: 分层融合方案显著优于标准算法，Re-Basin能增强模型对抗性和扰动鲁棒性，且参与融合的模型越多效果越强，但性能下降比原作者报告更严重。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin方法在鲁棒性方面有优势，但实际性能损失比预期更大，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统功能脑网络建模依赖局部成对交互，无法有效捕捉高阶依赖关系；现有超图建模方法计算负担重且依赖启发式方法，难以从数据分布中端到端学习网络结构。

Method: 提出全局约束导向的多分辨率(GCM)框架，整合4种全局约束(信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签)来学习4个不同分辨率水平(样本/被试/组/项目)的功能脑网络结构。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置下，相比9个基线和10个最先进方法，GCM实现了相对准确率提升30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

### [204] [RepDL: Bit-level Reproducible Deep Learning Training and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09180)
*Peichen Xie,Xian Zhang,Shuo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RepDL是一个开源库，通过强制正确舍入和顺序不变性来解决深度学习中的浮点计算不确定性问题，确保跨计算环境的确定性训练和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中存在非确定性和不可复现性问题，主要源于随机数生成和浮点计算。虽然随机性可以通过确定性配置控制，但浮点不一致性问题仍未解决。

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制正确舍入和顺序不变性来确保浮点计算的确定性。

Result: RepDL能够实现跨不同计算环境的位级可复现深度学习和推理。

Conclusion: RepDL有效解决了深度学习中的浮点计算不确定性问题，提供了可靠的复现性保障。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

*Ze Peng,Jian Zhang,Jintao Guo,Lei Qi,Yang Gao,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了持续学习中灾难性遗忘的根本原因：新任务训练本质上是对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，新任务梯度会自动与旧任务损失函数的尖锐方向对齐，导致旧任务损失快速增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习的目标是实现类似人类的技能积累能力，但其核心挑战——灾难性遗忘——在深度网络中的根本原因尚未被完全理解。

Method: 通过理论分析发现，训练的低秩偏置通过前向和后向传播将新旧任务梯度限制在同一低维子空间中，促进了对抗性对齐。提出backGP方法来解决后向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: 提出的backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少了10.8%的遗忘，并提高了12.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘源于新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，backGP方法能有效缓解这一问题，在持续学习中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

*Yumin Choi,Dongki Kim,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态提示优化问题，并开发了MPO框架，通过联合优化文本和非文本提示，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法仅限于文本，无法充分发挥多模态大语言模型的潜力，因此需要将提示优化扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出MPO框架，通过保持对齐的联合更新来优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯选择策略基于先验评估指导候选提示的选择过程。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤，MPO框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Flow Matching教师模型和MLP学生策略的在线强化学习方法，通过奖励模型和正则化机制解决FM策略在线学习的不稳定性和高推理成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching在离线模仿学习中表现优异，但由于缺乏环境交互和探索，在未见场景中泛化能力差。直接在线优化FM策略存在梯度不稳定和高推理成本的问题。

Method: 使用MLP结构的学生策略进行在线探索和RL更新，通过基于教师FM模型的奖励模型提供专家分布信息，并用同一教师模型正则化学生策略行为以稳定学习。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在从次优专家数据学习时表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过简单MLP学生策略和复杂FM教师模型的结合，成功解决了FM策略在线学习的挑战，实现了高效稳定的在线强化学习。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Method: 引入了质蕴含解释的新形式化方法，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然常包含冗余的键和原子，但能一致地捕获对预测反应可行性至关重要的分子属性

Conclusion: 所提出的质蕴含解释方法能够有效识别化学反应预测中的关键分子特征，为自动化合成规划提供了可解释性工具

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实证验证了所提方法的特性。

Conclusion: 提出的时间感知数据共享框架能有效激励早期参与者，满足公平性和个体理性要求。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

sets. The existing data set is represented by the subspace spanned by its first
principal components. Solutions for the case of the Euclidean metric are given.

Motivation: 金融机器学习模型容易因数据分布变化而性能下降，这一问题在发展中经济体尤为严重，因为这些地区经常面临不可预测的宏观经济冲击。本研究旨在探索在这些地区金融数据集上缓解模型漂移的方法。

Method: 研究采用合成异常值的方法来提高模型稳定性，并引入了一个两级评估框架来测量性能下降程度和冲击严重性。

Conclusion: 合成异常值是一种有效的模型漂移缓解方法，特别是在面临频繁宏观经济冲击的发展中经济体金融数据集中，但需要根据具体数据集和模型调整使用策略。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Conclusion: 该研究为提示数据集提供了系统性分析框架，提出的基于句法嵌入的优化方法能够有效改善LLM的提示工程效果，为更有效的提示设计提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环导致仿真效率低下，且存在多解模糊问题，需要一种高效的替代方法。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据集，通过残差训练策略解决多解模糊问题。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统中，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 残差告知的机器学习方法能有效替代代数环，显著提升仿真效率，同时保持准确性，为解决复杂系统中的代数环问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该工作为多智能体模仿学习提供了完整的理论框架，证明了非交互式方法的根本限制，并开发了具有近最优性能的交互式算法，填补了该领域的理论空白。

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Conclusion: 该框架为快速发展的LLM生态系统提供了一种可扩展且易于访问的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人类评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ方法，通过贝叶斯框架显式建模评分者质量，使用期望最大化算法保证单调似然收敛，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Motivation: 探讨在LLM预训练加速中，使用计算效率高的二阶结构近似方法会损失多少性能，为大规模训练提供性能上限参考。

Method: 应用完整高斯-牛顿(GN)预条件处理到Transformer模型，并与层间GN预条件处理器进行对比实验。

Result: 完整GN更新相比SOAP和Muon等强基线实现了5.4倍的训练迭代减少；层间GN预条件处理器几乎能达到完整GN方法的性能。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件处理非常有效；层间Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在增益；当前近似方法与理想层间oracle之间存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

*Ankush Pratap Singh,Houwei Cao,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHUCKLE是一个基于人类感知的课程学习框架，利用众包数据中的标注者一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，在情感识别任务中显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别中的课程学习方法通常依赖启发式、数据驱动或模型驱动的难度定义，忽视了人类感知难度这一在主观任务中至关重要的因素。

Method: 提出CHUCKLE框架，通过众包数据中标注者的一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类具有挑战性的样本对机器学习模型同样困难。

Result: 实验结果表明，CHUCKLE相比非课程学习基线，将LSTM的相对平均准确率提高了6.56%，Transformer提高了1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE通过融入人类感知难度，有效提升了情感识别模型的训练效率和鲁棒性，证明了感知驱动课程学习的有效性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了HINT框架来解决强化学习训练中的低训练亲和度问题，通过提供启发式提示而非直接答案，引导模型自主发现解决方案，在数学推理任务上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在任务难度超过模型能力时会出现奖励稀疏和训练效率低下的问题，先前工作使用离策略数据如混合RL与监督微调或使用提示的方法往往误导策略更新。

Method: 提出了HINT框架，通过提供启发式提示而非直接答案来引导模型，同时引入了Affinity指标来监控探索效率和训练稳定性。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的广泛实验表明，HINT始终优于现有方法，在各种规模的模型上都取得了最先进的结果，同时显示出更稳定的学习和更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: HINT框架通过自适应提示机制有效解决了强化学习中的训练亲和度问题，提高了模型的自主动推理能力，在复杂推理任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要化，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的令牌序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等信息，导致长序列或噪声序列中的效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。时间序列数据包含潜在的时序结构、局部平稳机制之间的转换、重复模式和变异性爆发，这些在标准表示学习流程中很少被利用。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多个时间分辨率下的变化点，然后使用均值等简单函数或GMM等生成模型对每个段进行摘要化。该框架作为模型无关的预处理器，可与现有无监督时间序列编码器集成而无需重新训练。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，STaTS能够实现完整模型性能的85-90%，同时显著降低计算成本。在UCR-85、UCR-128和UEA-30档案的分类任务，以及ETTh1、ETTh2、ETTm1和Electricity的预测任务中表现优异。STaTS在噪声下提高了鲁棒性，并保留了判别结构，优于均匀和基于聚类的压缩基线。

Conclusion: STaTS是一个原则性的通用解决方案，用于高效、结构感知的时间序列建模，通过自适应压缩和保留核心动态，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算需求。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了近期设计的经验成功，还为系统设计新序列模型架构提供了指导原则，连接了文献中的多个见解和观察。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效解决跨接收器可变性问题，确保射频指纹识别系统在实际部署中的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了权重初始化对信号传播和梯度流的影响，通过实验发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围提供稳定训练，Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中表现优于Xavier，并在GPT-2模型中观察到层间权重方差的深度依赖性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重初始化在训练开始时控制信号传播和梯度流，但缺乏对现代transformer架构的系统研究，需要连接经典初始化原则与现代模型行为。

Method: 使用对数扫描初始标准差来识别稳定区域，比较Kaiming和Xavier初始化在ReLU网络中的表现，并在12层GPT-2风格模型中跟踪Q/K/V权重方差在预训练期间的变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成稳定带，Kaiming初始化收敛更快更稳定，GPT-2模型中浅层权重方差快速扩展而深层变化更渐进。

Conclusion: 研究连接了经典初始化理论与现代transformer行为，为稳健训练提供了简单实用的指导原则。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在单峰偏好结构下的在线随机匹配算法，解决了预算约束下的用户-臂匹配问题，分别针对已知和未知偏好结构设计了两种高效算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线随机匹配问题中，由于缺乏结构假设导致最优匹配计算NP难的问题，通过引入社会选择理论中的单峰偏好结构来降低计算复杂度。

Method: 基于单峰偏好结构，设计了两种算法：1）使用PQ树进行顺序逼近的通用算法；2）当单峰结构已知时，采用UCB类算法。

Result: 通用算法实现了O(UKT^{2/3})的遗憾界，已知结构算法实现了O(U√(TK))的遗憾界，均显著优于无结构假设的情况。

Conclusion: 单峰偏好结构为在线随机匹配问题提供了有效的计算框架，使得在预算约束下能够设计出高效的学习算法。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象自然涌现且能改善缩放定律，为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流（USFs）在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USF等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USF作为非USF的直接替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督异常检测主要围绕深度单类分类（如Deep SVDD）和密度估计（如标准化流）两种范式展开，但两者之间的理论联系尚未明确。本文旨在揭示这两种方法的内在联系。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流（USFs）——具有常数雅可比行列式的标准化流，证明其最大似然训练可简化为Deep SVDD目标，并提出将USF作为现代异常检测架构中非USF的直接替代。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试和模型骨干上，用USF替代非USF能带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测。

Conclusion: USFs统一了两种主要的异常检测范式，既推进了理论理解又提升了实际性能，建议将USF作为异常检测架构的标准组件。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Motivation: 当前AI控制协议主要依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但这些监控器可能成为单点故障。论文旨在研究当攻击者了解协议和监控模型时的自适应攻击风险。

Method: 研究者实例化了一种简单的自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，利用监控模型的漏洞来绕过检测。

Result: 实验表明，前沿模型能够持续规避各种监控器，在两个主要AI控制基准测试中完成恶意任务。攻击对当前所有依赖监控器的协议都有效，甚至Defer-to-Resample协议会适得其反。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应该成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

TL;DR: 本文研究在局部差分隐私(LDP)约束下从分布中采样的局部极小极大风险问题，发现局部最优采样器在固定分布邻域内优于全局方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注分布类上的全局极小极大最优性，但本文从局部视角出发，研究在固定分布P0邻域内的极小极大风险，这更符合实际应用中存在公共数据分布的场景

Method: 将先前纯LDP工作扩展到更一般的函数LDP框架，证明全局最优函数LDP采样器在限制到P0邻域分布时能产生最优局部采样器，并推导出局部极小极大最优采样器的闭式表达式

Result: 确定了局部极小极大风险的确切值，该值取决于P0和隐私级别，且局部最优采样器在经验比较中始终优于全局极小极大采样器

Conclusion: 局部框架自然地模拟了具有公共数据的私有采样场景，其中公共数据分布由P0表示，局部最优方法在此类实际应用中具有显著优势

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

Motivation: 现有物理和数据驱动模型由于数据异质性和有限观测样本，难以在不同空间区域和尺度上泛化，特别是在环境生态系统建模中。

Method: 提出地理感知嵌入，利用地理信息显式捕捉跨区域和尺度的共享原则，并将其集成到门控时空图神经网络中，学习由地理和水文背景引导的复杂时空模式。

Result: 在美国东海岸多个流域37年真实数据集上的评估显示，Geo-STARS在跨区域和尺度的泛化性能优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS为可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated
machine learning (AutoML) framework, Parameter Efficient Training with Robust
Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

Conclusion: MODE特别适合处理噪声模式转换，能够解决计算生物学中的关键挑战

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和密集奖励信号，但在困难问题中面临两个挑战：基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号，以及奖励评估成本高昂。

Conclusion: BaNEL算法能够有效处理稀疏奖励环境中的学习挑战，通过仅利用失败样本实现模型改进，为困难生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.
