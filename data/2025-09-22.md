### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LLM2VEC4CXR和LLM2CLIP4CXR两个模型，用于解决放射学报告中异质性和噪声问题，通过大语言模型编码器提升胸片报告的理解和图像-文本对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学临床报告存在缩写、仅印象笔记和风格变异等异质性问题，单纯扩大噪声报告数据集会导致模型性能停滞甚至下降，需要更鲁棒的临床表示方法。

Method: 引入LLM2VEC4CXR（领域适应的大语言模型编码器）和LLM2CLIP4CXR（双塔框架），结合视觉骨干网络，在160万胸片研究数据上进行训练。

Result: LLM2VEC4CXR在临床文本理解上优于BERT基线，能处理缩写和风格变异；LLM2CLIP4CXR提升了检索准确率和临床对齐分数，具有更强的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性而非单纯的数据规模是有效多模态学习的关键，模型已发布以支持医学图像-文本表示学习的进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec是一个针对视觉语言模型的推测解码框架，通过轻量级视觉适配器压缩图像标记，结合全局特征增强多模态一致性，在VLM推测解码中实现了显著的加速效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码技术在视觉语言模型中的应用探索不足，现有方法只能实现有限的加速效果（<1.5倍），而多模态能力在大规模模型中变得越来越重要

Method: ViSpec采用轻量级视觉适配器模块压缩图像标记为紧凑表示，将其整合到草稿模型的注意力机制中，同时提取全局特征向量增强多模态一致性，并通过专门训练数据集解决多模态数据稀缺问题

Result: ViSpec在视觉语言模型的推测解码中实现了显著的加速效果，据我们所知，这是首次在VLM推测解码中实现实质性加速

Conclusion: ViSpec框架有效解决了VLM推测解码中的关键挑战，证明了大型VLM能够有效过滤冗余图像信息而不影响文本理解，为多模态模型的高效推理提供了新思路

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [3] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE是一个多模态合规检查框架，使用母-子MLLM架构统一处理视觉和文本内容，在广告合规场景中实现单次评估超过15个合规属性，推理成本降低31倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合规框架依赖分散的多阶段流程，存在操作复杂、扩展性差、难以适应动态指南的问题。MLLM的出现为统一处理多模态内容提供了可能。

Method: 采用母-子MLLM架构，强母模型评估小子模型的输出，构建包含视觉遮挡和不当内容注入的增强基准数据集进行结构化评估。

Result: 推理成本降低31倍（从0.0159降至0.0005每图像），在广告数据上实现实时部署，在保持可比准确性的同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: M-PACE框架通过统一的MLLM方法有效解决了多模态合规检查的复杂性问题，展示了在成本和质量权衡方面的显著优势，为自动化质量控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [4] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)
*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion是一个结合深度学习和原子力显微镜（AFM）的混合框架，用于预测大型蛋白质复合体的3D结构。通过虚拟AFM生成合成数据集，训练条件扩散模型和NeRF模型实现多视角3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方法在预测大型蛋白质复合体结构时缺乏3D空间线索，而实验方法如Cryo-EM成本高且耗时。需要开发准确且成本效益高的替代方案。

Method: 开发虚拟AFM框架模拟成像过程，生成542,000个蛋白质的多视角合成AFM图像数据集。训练条件扩散模型合成新视角，使用实例特定NeRF模型进行3D重建。

Result: 重建的3D蛋白质结构在AFM成像分辨率内达到平均Chamfer距离，显示出高结构保真度。在实验AFM图像上广泛验证，证明方法有效性。

Conclusion: ProFusion展示了在准确、成本效益高的蛋白质复合体结构预测和快速迭代验证方面的强大潜力，为蛋白质结构研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态可解释学习（MMEL）框架，通过分层语义关系模块增强视觉语言模型的可解释性，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键场景中应用视觉语言模型面临挑战，需要提高模型的透明度和可靠性，以处理复杂对象关系和细微视觉线索。

Method: 基于梯度解释方法（Grad-eclip），引入分层语义关系模块，采用多尺度特征处理、自适应注意力加权和跨模态对齐技术。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，MMEL能产生更聚焦和上下文感知的可视化结果，更好地反映模型处理复杂场景的方式。

Conclusion: MMEL框架在不同领域具有通用性，为需要高可解释性和可靠性的应用提供了有价值的模型决策洞察。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [6] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了导航感知剪枝（NAP）方法，专门针对视觉语言导航任务，通过预过滤前景和背景token来简化剪枝过程，在保持高成功率的同时节省超过50%的计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型在视觉语言导航任务上表现优异但计算成本高，现有剪枝方法未考虑VLN特有挑战，如信息丢失可能导致更长的导航路径，反而增加计算成本。

Method: 使用导航特定特征预过滤token：基于导航方向过滤图像视图，用大语言模型提取导航相关指令，重点剪枝背景token，同时移除低重要性导航节点以避免回溯。

Result: 在标准VLN基准测试中，NAP显著优于现有方法，在节省超过50%FLOPS的同时保持了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: NAP方法通过导航感知的token过滤策略，有效解决了VLN任务中剪枝带来的信息丢失问题，实现了效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [7] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff是一个负责任文本到图像生成框架，通过双模块转换扩散模型的中间瓶颈表示，在保持语义对齐的同时优化公平性和安全性，性能提升20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了快速进展，但确保公平性和安全性仍然是一个开放挑战。现有方法通常以牺牲语义保真度和图像质量为代价来提高公平性和安全性

Method: 提出RespoDiff框架，在扩散模型的中间瓶颈表示上引入双模块转换：一个模块专注于捕获和执行负责任概念（如公平性和安全性），另一个模块致力于保持与中性提示的语义对齐。采用新颖的分数匹配目标来促进双学习过程

Result: 该方法在负责任生成方面优于最先进方法，确保语义对齐的同时优化两个目标而不损害图像保真度。在多样未见提示上，负责任和语义连贯生成提高了20%。可无缝集成到SDXL等大规模模型中

Conclusion: RespoDiff框架有效解决了文本到图像生成中的公平性和安全性问题，在保持高质量图像生成的同时显著提升了负责任生成能力

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [8] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自动引导和在线数据选择方法是否能提高生成扩散模型的训练效率和样本效率，发现自动引导能持续改善样本质量和多样性，而早期数据选择在数据效率上能与自动引导相当或略优，但由于时间开销和复杂性，在多数情况下自动引导或均匀随机选择更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的计算成本重新激发了高效数据管理的希望，研究旨在探索自动引导和在线数据选择方法是否能提高扩散模型的训练时间和样本效率。

Method: 将联合示例选择（JEST）和自动引导整合到统一代码库中进行快速消融和基准测试，在2-D合成数据生成和3x64x64-D图像生成任务上评估数据管理组合，并在相等墙钟时间和样本数下进行比较。

Result: 自动引导在所有实验中持续改善样本质量和多样性；早期AJEST在数据效率上能与自动引导相当或略优，但由于时间开销和复杂性，自动引导或均匀随机选择在多数情况下更优。

Conclusion: 定向在线选择在早期训练中可能带来效率增益，但稳健的样本质量改进主要由自动引导驱动；讨论了局限性和适用范围，并概述了数据选择可能有益的情况。

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

### [9] [PRISM: Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15270)
*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一个基于傅里叶变换相位增强的径向图像签名映射框架，用于指纹识别AI生成图像，实现模型溯源，在多个基准测试中达到81.60%-95.06%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业环境中需要对AI生成内容进行溯源，确保用户获得的内容来源可信，特别是在付费专有服务中需要提供来源保证。

Method: 基于离散傅里叶变换的径向降维方法，利用振幅和相位信息捕捉模型特定签名，通过线性判别分析进行聚类实现模型溯源。

Result: 在PRISM-36K数据集上达到92.04%的溯源准确率，在四个文献基准测试中平均准确率81.60%，真假图像检测平均准确率88.41%，在GenImage上达到95.06%。

Conclusion: 频域指纹识别方法在跨架构和跨数据集的模型溯源中有效，为生成式AI系统的问责和信任提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [10] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)
*Sebastian Ray Mason,Anders Gjølbye,Phillip Chavarria Højbjerg,Lenka Tětková,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3在心理旋转任务上的表现，发现自监督ViT比监督ViT更能捕捉几何结构，中间层表现优于最终层，任务难度随旋转复杂度和遮挡增加而增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理旋转是人类空间推理的关键测试，但现代视觉变换器是否具备类似能力尚不清楚，需要系统评估这些模型在心理旋转任务上的表现。

Method: 通过逐层探测模型表示，评估多种ViT模型在从简单块结构到复杂块图形、文本和真实物体的心理旋转任务上的表现。

Result: 自监督ViT比监督ViT更好地捕捉几何结构；中间层表现优于最终层；任务难度随旋转复杂度和遮挡增加而增加，与人类反应时间模式相似。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器在心理旋转任务上表现出与人类相似的约束模式，自监督学习和中间层表示对空间推理能力的发展至关重要。

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了未经修改的ViT特征在图像分类和分割任务中的内在表示能力，分析了不同token类型和决策规则在不同任务和预训练目标下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSL方法通常对预训练的ViT特征进行额外处理以获得更好的任务性能，但缺乏对未经修改的ViT特征内在表示能力的全面分析。

Method: 使用基于超平面（如逻辑回归）或余弦相似度的分类和分割规则，分析不同token类型（keys、queries、values等）在标准和小样本场景下的表现。

Result: 研究提供了关于不同任务、上下文和预训练目标下最优token类型和决策选择的详细发现。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了对未经修改ViT特征内在能力分析的空缺，为不同应用场景下的特征选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的条件域提示学习(CoDoL)方法，通过利用可用的域信息构建提示并改进视觉-语言嵌入对齐，以提升视觉语言模型在分布外(OOD)场景下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示的CLIP方法存在两个主要问题：1）不准确的文本描述导致精度和鲁棒性下降；2）有限的视觉-语言嵌入对齐影响泛化性能。这些问题限制了零样本CLIP方法在OOD场景下的表现。

Method: 提出CoDoL方法，利用域信息构建提示，并设计轻量级域元网络(DMN)来生成每个域中图像的输入条件标记，以同时捕获实例特定和域特定信息。

Result: 在四个OOD基准测试(PACS、VLCS、OfficeHome和DigitDG)上的广泛实验验证了CoDoL在改进视觉-语言嵌入对齐和OOD泛化性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CoDoL方法通过条件域提示学习和域元网络有效解决了CLIP方法在OOD场景下的局限性，显著提升了视觉语言模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN是一个主动自适应视觉框架，将视觉感知建模为从粗到精的顺序决策过程，通过选择性注视任务相关区域来大幅降低计算成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器视觉模型被动处理整个场景，导致计算资源需求随输入分辨率和模型规模线性增长，限制了实际应用和未来发展。人类视觉的高效自适应采样机制启发了该研究。

Method: 将视觉感知建模为顺序决策过程，结合表示学习和自奖励强化学习，实现端到端训练，无需额外的注视位置监督。模型逐步识别并关注任务相关区域，增量整合信息，在足够时主动结束观察。

Result: 在17个基准测试（涵盖9个任务）中，AdaptiveNN实现了高达28倍的推理成本降低而不损失准确性，能灵活适应不同任务需求和资源预算，无需重新训练，并提供可解释的注视模式。

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN展示了构建高效、灵活、可解释计算机视觉系统的有前景途径，在许多情况下表现出接近人类的感知行为，有望成为研究视觉认知的有价值工具。

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

*Jiuyi Xu,Qing Jin,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng,Yang Sui,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LowDiff是一个基于级联方法的创新扩散框架，通过从低分辨率到高分辨率的渐进式生成，显著提高了扩散模型的采样效率，在保持或提升生成质量的同时实现了超过50%的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著成功，但实际应用受到采样速度慢的限制。现有改进方法主要关注模型压缩或减少去噪步骤，忽视了在生成过程中利用多分辨率输入的可能性。

Method: 提出LowDiff框架，采用级联方法生成逐步提高分辨率的输出，使用统一模型从低分辨率渐进细化到目标分辨率。该方法适用于像素空间和潜在空间的扩散模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、FFHQ和ImageNet上的实验显示，LowDiff在保持可比或更好质量的同时实现了超过50%的吞吐量提升。具体指标：无条件CIFAR-10 FID 2.11、IS 9.87；条件CIFAR-10 FID 1.94、IS 10.03；FFHQ 64x64 FID 2.43；ImageNet 256x256 FID 4.00、IS 195.06。

Conclusion: LowDiff通过创新的架构设计和生成技术，证明了利用多分辨率输入可以显著提高扩散模型的效率，同时保持生成质量，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

TL;DR: 提出MaskAttn-SDXL方法，通过在SDXL的交叉注意力logits中注入区域级门控机制来解决多对象提示中的组合失败问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在实现逼真效果时，经常在处理包含多个对象、属性和空间关系的提示时出现组合失败，导致实体纠缠、属性混淆和空间线索违反

Method: 在SDXL UNet的交叉注意力logits中学习每层的二进制掩码，在softmax之前注入到每个交叉注意力logit图中，稀疏化token到潜在空间的交互，只保留语义相关的连接

Result: 模型在多对象提示中提高了空间合规性和属性绑定，同时保持了整体图像质量和多样性

Conclusion: logit级别的掩码交叉注意力是实施组合控制的数据高效原语，该方法可作为文本到图像生成中空间控制的实用扩展

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

*Mst Tasnim Pervin,George Bebis,Fang Jiang,Alireza Tavakkoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaceGAN是一个新颖的多域图像到图像转换框架，专门用于种族特征转换，能够在保持个体特征和高层语义的同时，无需参考图像即可映射多个域的样式代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GAN模型如CycleGAN、StarGAN等在多域图像转换中存在局限性：要么只能处理一对域，要么无法映射深层次的低级样式变化，或者需要额外的参考图像且无法保持个体特征。本研究旨在通过多域图像转换来翻译种族特征。

Method: 提出了RaceGAN框架，该框架能够在种族属性转换过程中映射多个域的样式代码，同时保持个体特征和高层语义，且不依赖参考图像。模型在芝加哥人脸数据集上进行了测试。

Result: RaceGAN在翻译种族特征（亚洲人、白人和黑人）方面优于其他模型。使用基于InceptionReNetv2的分类进行定量评估，证明了种族转换的有效性。模型还能将潜在空间划分为不同种族群体的明显聚类。

Conclusion: RaceGAN在多域种族特征转换方面表现出色，能够有效保持个体特征并实现高质量的样式映射，为种族属性转换提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型缺乏可解释性，现有方法要么局限于单个图像的视觉解释，要么需要大量标注成本。

Method: 利用少量图像的用户定义部件标签，通过高效迁移技术扩展到大数据集，聚合部件层面的局部解释形成全局符号解释。

Result: 能够在大规模上为模型决策提供人类可理解的解释，避免了高昂的标注成本。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了深度学习模型可解释性问题，在降低标注成本的同时提供了全局性的符号解释。

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果关系的生成模型指纹识别方法，通过解耦图像内容与模型痕迹的因果关系，在语义不变的潜在空间中提取因果指纹，显著提升了模型溯源性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模型特定线索或合成伪影，生成的指纹泛化能力有限。作者认为完整的模型指纹应反映图像来源与模型痕迹之间的因果关系，这是当前研究尚未充分探索的方向。

Method: 提出了因果解耦框架，在预训练扩散重建残差导出的语义不变潜在空间中，将因果指纹从图像特定内容和风格中解耦出来，并通过多样化特征表示增强指纹粒度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在GAN和扩散模型的溯源任务中优于现有方法，并通过因果指纹生成的反事实示例实现了来源匿名化。

Conclusion: 该方法在伪造检测、模型版权追踪和身份保护方面具有强大潜力，验证了因果指纹概念的有效性。

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

TL;DR: 开发神经肿瘤专用基础模型，采用分布鲁棒优化解决数据异质性和罕见分子标记预测问题，显著提升分子分类和生存预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经肿瘤数据异质性和肿瘤复杂性限制了基础模型的泛化能力，现有模型对罕见分子标记预测效果差，而这些标记对治疗反应和风险分层至关重要。

Method: 在多机构脑肿瘤MRI上预训练自监督骨干网络（BYOL、DINO、MAE、MoCo），应用分布鲁棒优化（DRO）缓解站点和类别不平衡问题。

Result: 方法显著改善分子预测并减少站点特异性嵌入差异：CUIMC平均平衡准确率从0.744提升至0.785，AUC从0.656提升至0.676；罕见标记如CDKN2A/2B准确率从0.86提升至0.92；生存预测c-index在所有站点均有提升。

Conclusion: 基础模型与DRO结合产生更站点不变的表征，改善常见和罕见标记预测，增强生存区分能力，需要前瞻性验证和整合纵向信号以推进精准神经肿瘤学。

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

TL;DR: ORCA是一个基于代理推理的框架，通过观察-推理-批判-行动循环，利用小型视觉模型提升大型视觉语言模型的准确性，减少幻觉并增强对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题和对抗攻击脆弱性，限制了其在现实应用中的可靠性。

Method: 采用观察-推理-批判-行动循环，查询多个视觉工具进行证据验证，无需访问模型内部或重新训练。

Result: 在POPE基准上提升3.64%-40.67%，对抗攻击下平均准确率提升20.11%，结合防御技术进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: ORCA为构建更可靠、鲁棒的多模态系统提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可变形卷积局限于固定四边形采样区域，无法灵活适应复杂图像结构，需要更精确控制感受野形状的方法。

Method: 使用四个边界偏移量代替传统的单个偏移量，为每个卷积核元素创建可调整的矩形采样区域，实现感受野宽度和高度的解耦控制。

Result: RAD-Conv能够精确控制感受野形状，即使使用1x1小卷积核也能捕捉局部细节和长距离依赖关系。

Conclusion: RAD-Conv在保持卷积计算效率的同时，提供了接近注意力机制的灵活性，为构建更高效、表达能力更强的视觉模型提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

*Vaibhav Mishra,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了6种计算病理学基础模型的表示空间结构，发现不同训练范式（视觉-语言对比学习 vs 自蒸馏）的模型在表示相似性、幻灯片依赖性和内在维度方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在计算病理学中的快速发展，虽然已有研究评估了任务性能，但对模型学习表示的结构和变异性了解不足，需要系统分析其表示空间特征。

Method: 使用计算神经科学中的表示相似性分析技术，在TCGA的H&E图像补丁上分析6种CPath基础模型（CONCH、PLIP、KEEP、UNI2、Virchow2、Prov-GigaPath）的表示结构。

Result: UNI2和Virchow2表示结构最独特，Prov-GigaPath平均相似度最高；所有模型都表现出高幻灯片依赖性但低疾病依赖性；染色标准化可降低幻灯片依赖性5.5%-20.5%；视觉-语言模型表示更紧凑，视觉模型表示更分散。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于改进对幻灯片特异性特征的鲁棒性，指导模型集成策略，并为理解训练范式如何塑造模型表示提供见解，该框架可扩展到其他医学影像领域。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常依赖超大模型，计算和内存需求过高，难以在资源受限环境（如仓库、机器人、工业应用）中部署，而这些环境需要高效且鲁棒的空间理解能力。

Method: 采用三阶段课程学习：逐步对齐视觉和语言特征、实现空间关系理解、适应任务特定数据集。整合RGB和深度线索进行区域级空间推理。

Conclusion: 研究表明在现实世界环境中可以实现高效、可部署的多模态智能，而不会牺牲核心空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

Abstract: We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from
a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity
fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert
ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for
conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen
reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers
through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity
preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through
evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which
yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the
state of personalized video generation.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过可逆掩码和双层优化有效解决了后门攻击防御问题，在保持模型性能的同时提高了防御效果和可解释性。

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

### [31] [MEC-Quant: Maximum Entropy Coding for Extremely Low Bit Quantization-Aware Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15514)
*Junbiao Pang,Tianyang Cai,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为最大熵编码量化（MEC-Quant）的新方法，通过优化表示结构来解决量化过程中的偏差问题，特别是在极低比特设置下，使量化感知训练的性能能够媲美甚至超越全精度模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的量化感知训练（QAT）方法在全精度模型相比下性能仍然较差。作者认为量化不可避免地会引入表示偏差，尤其是在极低比特设置下，这限制了QAT的性能。

Method: 提出MEC-Quant方法，利用损失数据编码中的最小编码长度作为熵的计算可处理替代，并基于混合专家（MOE）推导出可扩展的目标重新表述，实现快速计算并处理权重或激活值的长尾分布。

Result: 在计算机视觉任务上的大量实验证明其优越性。MEC-Quant首次将QAT的极限推至x位激活，其精度可与全精度模型相媲美甚至超越，在QAT领域建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MEC-Quant通过更原则性的目标函数优化表示结构，有效减少了量化引入的偏差，显著提升了量化感知训练的性能，特别是在极低比特设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI定位方法在处理高分辨率屏幕截图时往往难以实现细粒度的定位精度，需要一种能够动态调整推理策略的解决方案。

Method: 提出自适应区域感知(ARP)和自适应阶段控制(ASC)机制，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调+基于组相对策略优化(GRPO)的强化微调，实现单阶段或多阶段自适应推理。

Result: 在GUI定位基准测试中取得最先进性能，7B模型在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到60.8%准确率，在UI-Vision上达到30.9%，甚至能与72B模型竞争。

Conclusion: GUI-ARP框架通过自适应多阶段推理策略，有效解决了高分辨率GUI定位问题，在保持模型规模较小的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Conclusion: SAMPO框架通过混合建模方法有效解决了世界模型中的视觉连贯性问题，在保持高效推理的同时提升了预测质量和物理真实性。

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种对称双向多模态学习框架，用于欲望、情感和情绪识别，通过文本和图像模态的相互指导来捕捉意图相关表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析方法主要关注语言线索而忽视图像作为补充的非语言线索，多模态方法在人类欲望理解方面研究不足。

Method: 使用低分辨率图像获取全局视觉表示进行跨模态对齐，高分辨率图像分割为子图像并通过掩码图像建模捕捉细粒度局部特征。引入文本引导的图像解码器和图像引导的文本解码器促进深度跨模态交互。

Result: 在MSED数据集上实验表明，该方法在欲望理解、情感识别和情绪分析方面分别实现了1.1%、0.6%和0.9%的F1分数提升，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的对称双向多模态学习框架有效提升了欲望、情感和情绪识别的性能，验证了文本和图像模态相互指导策略的有效性。

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Sa2VA方法虽然结合了LLM和SAM-2，但在视频分割中仍存在误报问题，需要更精确的验证机制和更好的时间上下文捕捉

Method: 1) 视频语言检查器：显式验证查询中的主体和动作是否实际出现在视频中；2) 关键帧采样器：自适应选择信息丰富的帧来捕捉早期对象出现和长程时间上下文

Result: 在MeViS测试集上达到64.14%的J&F分数，在ICCV 2025第7届LSVOS挑战赛的RVOS赛道中排名第2

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架通过引入验证机制和智能帧采样，有效提升了RVOS任务的性能，证明了在现有模型基础上进行改进的可行性

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Conclusion: 该框架为稀疏视图和多外观场景的3D重建提供了有效解决方案，通过几何先验和虚拟视图监督有效缓解了过拟合问题。

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签分类需要能够捕捉多标签交互的强大表示能力，而现有的CNN、图和Transformer基线方法性能有限

Method: 从预训练扩散Transformer模型中提取中间特征，通过启发式局部搜索算法找到最优的"图像-文本"×"块-时间步"对，使用简单的融合线性投影进行特征融合

Result: 在MS-COCO-enhanced上达到98.6% mAP，在Visual Genome 500上达到45.7% mAP，超越了现有的CNN、图和Transformer基线方法

Conclusion: Diff-Feat框架能够形成更紧密的语义聚类，为多标签分类任务提供了强大的特征表示方法

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Motivation: 在资源受限环境中，视觉和听力威胁性疾病导致可预防的残疾，但缺乏专家和筛查设备。AI辅助筛查和远程医疗有潜力扩大早期检测，但在纸质工作流程中的实际部署具有挑战性。

Method: 采用迭代式跨学科合作方法，包括早期原型开发、影子部署和持续反馈，以构建共享理解并减少从纸质工作流程向AI就绪工作流程过渡时的可用性障碍。

Result: 研究发现公共数据集和AI模型尽管因领域偏移而性能不佳，但仍非常有用。需要自动化的AI图像质量检查以在高容量营地中捕获可分级图像进行稳健筛查。

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

TL;DR: DC-Mamba是一个基于ChangeMamba的"先对齐后增强"框架，通过BTDA模块解决几何错位问题，使用SSCA模块增强变化信号并抑制噪声，显著提升了遥感变化检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遥感变化检测方法（包括最先进的状态空间模型）缺乏明确的几何错位处理机制，难以区分真实变化和噪声。

Method: 提出DC-Mamba框架，包含两个轻量级即插即用模块：双时相可变形对齐模块（BTDA）用于语义特征级别的几何对齐，尺度稀疏变化放大器（SSCA）用于选择性增强高置信度变化信号。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法显著优于ChangeMamba基线，F1分数从0.5730提升到0.5903，IoU从0.4015提升到0.4187。

Conclusion: "先对齐后增强"策略有效解决了遥感变化检测中的几何和特征级挑战，提供了一个鲁棒且易于部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

TL;DR: 提出“Blink-Think-Link”框架，模仿人类认知过程进行GUI交互，通过三个生物启发阶段实现更自然的人机交互


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的GUI交互系统与自然人类交互模式存在显著偏差，需要更符合人类认知过程的交互逻辑

Method: 将交互分解为三个阶段：Blink（快速检测注意力）、Think（高级推理决策）、Link（生成可执行命令），并引入Blink数据生成和BTL奖励机制

Result: 开发的BTL-UI模型在静态GUI理解和动态交互任务中均表现出最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该框架为开发高级GUI代理提供了有效的实证验证，能够显著提升人机交互的自然性和效率

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了显著性目标检测（SOD）评估协议中的尺寸不变性问题，提出了尺寸不变性评估框架SIEva和优化框架SIOpt，解决了多尺寸显著对象检测中的评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOD评估指标存在尺寸敏感性，导致大尺寸区域主导评估结果，而小尺寸但语义重要的对象被忽视，造成性能评估偏差。

Method: 通过理论推导揭示现有指标的尺寸敏感性，提出SIEva框架对可分离组件进行单独评估和结果聚合，并开发模型无关的SIOpt优化框架。

Result: SIEva和SIOpt能有效缓解尺寸不平衡影响，显著提升各种尺寸显著对象的检测性能，理论分析和实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的尺寸不变性评估和优化框架解决了SOD中的关键评估偏差问题，为多尺寸显著对象检测提供了更公平和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable
capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios
like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we
develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery
analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition
across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}.
EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover
1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph
of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded
reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis,
simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain
knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability.
In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B,
achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared
models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and
\textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals
the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation
for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在一般视频理解表现出色，但在快速高频运动如网球中表现不佳，因为网球回合片段短但信息密集，需要专门评估框架。

Method: 将每个网球回合建模为时间有序的连续击球事件序列，使用自动化流程进行筛选和问题生成，涵盖8个回合和击球级别任务。

Result: 评估16个代表性MLLMs显示存在显著不足，关键发现：帧采样密度需要根据任务定制和平衡，改进时间定位对增强推理能力至关重要。

Conclusion: TennisTV基准揭示了MLLMs在网球视频理解中的系统性缺陷，为未来模型改进提供了重要指导，特别是时间推理能力的提升。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips
are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this
challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive
benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a
temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated
pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于病理报告辅助的自蒸馏框架（Rasa），用于全切片图像（WSI）的生存分析，通过LLM提取病理报告中的细粒度文本描述，并利用自蒸馏和风险感知混合策略提升预后预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WSI生存分析面临噪声特征和数据可访问性限制的问题，而病理报告包含丰富的患者特异性信息但尚未被充分探索用于增强WSI分析。

Method: 1. 使用LLM通过任务提示从原始病理报告中提取WSI相关文本描述；2. 设计自蒸馏管道，在教师模型文本知识指导下过滤学生模型的无关特征；3. 在学生模型训练中引入风险感知混合策略增加数据量和多样性。

Result: 在收集的CRC数据和公开TCGA-BRCA数据上的实验表明，Rasa方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Rasa框架有效整合了病理报告的文本信息，通过自蒸馏和混合策略显著提升了WSI生存分析的性能。

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单车辆感知的不稳定性限制了轨迹预测性能，需要利用车辆和道路基础设施的多源数据进行协同预测来提高预测的完整性和准确性。

Method: 提出基于匈牙利算法和卡尔曼滤波的融合模块，结合历史时间注意力模块、模式注意力模块和锚点导向解码器，对多源轨迹数据进行早期融合。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X-Seq数据集上的大量实验表明，CoPAD实现了最先进的性能，验证了该模型在V2X场景中协同轨迹预测的有效性。

Conclusion: CoPAD框架通过有效的多源数据融合和注意力机制，显著提升了协同轨迹预测的准确性和多样性，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的预测能力。

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PCSR框架，通过伪标签一致性指导样本细化，解决跨模态检索中噪声对应问题，提升检索鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索方法假设图像-文本对完美对齐，忽略了真实数据中的噪声对应问题。这些未对齐的配对会误导相似性学习并降低检索性能。

Method: 提出PCSR框架：1）基于置信度估计区分干净和噪声对；2）通过伪标签一致性细化噪声对；3）提出PCS评分量化预测稳定性；4）采用自适应配对优化策略。

Result: 在CC152K、MS-COCO和Flickr30K数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法在噪声监督下提高检索鲁棒性的有效性。

Conclusion: PCSR框架通过细粒度样本划分和自适应优化策略，有效解决了跨模态检索中的噪声对应问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于混合分布的单目深度估计方法，通过建模像素级深度为多个可能深度的混合分布，在仅使用自监督的情况下实现清晰的深度边界，显著提升边界锐度和点云质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在物体边界处容易产生模糊，引入虚假的3D点。虽然实现锐利边缘通常需要细粒度监督，但本文旨在仅通过自监督实现清晰的深度不连续性。

Method: 将每个像素的深度建模为混合分布，捕捉多个可能的深度值，将不确定性从直接回归转移到混合权重。通过方差感知损失函数和不确定性传播无缝集成到现有流程中。

Result: 在KITTI和VKITTIv2数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法相比最先进基线实现了高达35%的边界锐度提升，并改善了点云质量。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了通过混合分布建模深度不确定性，可以在仅使用自监督的情况下有效解决深度边界模糊问题，为3D场景理解提供了更准确的深度估计。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了医学图像分割在联邦学习环境下的异构数据挑战，为隐私保护的医疗AI应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GS-Scale是一个针对3D高斯泼溅技术的高效训练系统，通过将高斯数据存储在主机内存中并按需传输到GPU，显著降低了GPU内存需求3.3-5.6倍，同时保持与纯GPU训练相当的速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然提供了高质量的图形渲染和快速渲染速度，但在大规模场景的高质量训练中面临GPU内存不足的挑战，因为需要存储参数、梯度和优化器状态。

Method: GS-Scale采用三种系统级优化：(1)选择性卸载几何参数以加速视锥体剔除；(2)参数前向传递将CPU优化器更新与GPU计算流水线化；(3)延迟优化器更新以减少对零梯度高斯的不必要内存访问。

Result: 在大型数据集上的评估显示，GS-Scale将GPU内存需求降低了3.3-5.6倍，在RTX 4070移动GPU上可将高斯数量从400万扩展到1800万，LPIPS指标提升23-35%。

Conclusion: GS-Scale使得在消费级GPU上实现大规模3D高斯泼溅训练成为可能，解决了内存限制问题，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Conclusion: 基于PCA的表面重建模型能有效处理不完整点云数据，在缺失区域实现准确表面重建。

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

TL;DR: Camera Splatting是一种新颖的视图优化框架，通过将相机建模为3D高斯分布（相机splat）并在表面附近放置虚拟相机来优化视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂视角依赖现象（如强烈金属反射和复杂纹理）的捕捉问题，改进现有Farthest View Sampling方法的局限性。

Method: 将每个相机建模为3D高斯分布（相机splat），在表面附近采样3D点放置虚拟相机（点相机），通过可微分地优化相机splat来获得目标分布。

Result: 与FVS方法相比，该方法在捕捉复杂视角依赖现象方面表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: Camera Splatting框架为新颖视图合成提供了一种有效的优化方法，特别适用于处理复杂的视角依赖效果。

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,
including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的手写笔画生成方法，通过多尺度注意力特征和词间距布局来模仿书法风格，相比现有方法在笔画生成方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写笔画生成对于提升手写识别和书写者顺序恢复等任务性能至关重要。现有研究虽然利用了书法特征，但未考虑词间距（词布局）这一重要特征，导致风格模仿时词间距不一致。

Method: 1. 提出多尺度注意力特征来模仿书法风格，突出局部和全局风格特征；2. 引入词布局特征以促进词间距控制；3. 提出条件扩散模型来预测笔画，而不是直接生成风格图像，从而获得时间坐标信息。

Result: 实验表明，提出的扩散模型在笔画生成方面优于当前最先进的方法，并与最近的图像生成网络具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过结合书法风格和词布局的条件扩散模型，能够更好地模仿手写风格并生成具有书法风格的笔画，为手写相关任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种受人类扫视视觉启发的两阶段细粒度视觉分类方法，通过外围特征提取和注视点采样来解决现有基于部件方法的空间冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于部件的细粒度分类方法存在复杂定位网络导致特征效用受限、采样点空间冗余严重、难以确定最优部件数量等问题。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：首先提取外围特征生成采样图，然后使用权重共享编码器并行编码注视点补丁，利用情境化选择性注意力加权每个注视点补丁的影响，并使用非极大值抑制消除冗余。

Result: 在标准FGVC基准和具有挑战性的昆虫数据集上，该方法达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，并持续优于基线编码器。

Conclusion: 提出的受人类视觉启发的两阶段方法有效解决了细粒度分类中的空间冗余问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

TL;DR: SceneForge是一个通过结构化多对象场景组合来增强3D点云与文本对比学习的新框架，利用单个3D形状构建具有明确空间关系的多对象场景，并通过语言模型生成连贯的多对象描述，有效解决3D-文本数据集稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模3D-文本数据集稀缺的问题，通过结构化场景组合丰富数据复杂性和多样性，提升3D与文本的对比对齐效果。

Method: 利用单个3D形状构建多对象场景，明确空间关系，通过大语言模型生成连贯的多对象描述，在对比训练中增加结构化组合样本。

Result: 在多个任务上取得显著性能提升，包括ModelNet、ScanObjNN等的零样本分类，ShapeNetPart的少样本分割，以及ScanQA的3D视觉问答，且方法具有模型无关性。

Conclusion: SceneForge通过结构化场景组合有效增强了3D-文本对比学习，在各种任务中表现出色，并展示了空间推理能力。

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ORIC基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在对象-上下文关系异常情况下的识别能力，揭示了LVLMs在对象误识别和幻觉方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述、视觉问答等领域取得显著进展，但在对象与上下文关系异常的场景中容易出错，存在对象误识别和幻觉问题，需要系统性地评估这些局限性。

Method: 引入ORIC基准测试，采用两种关键策略：(1) LLM引导采样识别存在但上下文异常的对象；(2) CLIP引导采样检测可能被幻觉但实际不存在的对象，创建异常上下文场景。

Result: 评估了18个LVLMs和2个开放词汇检测模型，结果显示在上下文异常情况下存在显著的识别差距，凸显了LVLMs在处理异常上下文关系时的挑战。

Conclusion: 该工作为LVLMs的局限性提供了重要见解，鼓励进一步研究上下文感知的对象识别技术。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时面临计算效率低下的问题，现有方法通过图像分割会产生大量视觉分词，导致推理时计算开销呈指数级增长。

Method: 提出金字塔分词剪枝(PTP)策略，结合区域级和分词级的视觉显著性分析，以及指令引导的重要性评估，选择性保留关键分词。

Result: 在13个多样化基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了计算开销和推理延迟，性能损失最小。

Conclusion: PTP策略通过模拟人类视觉注意力机制，为高效处理高分辨率图像提供了一种有效的训练无关解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods

Method: TrueMoE采用双路由机制，包括粒度感知稀疏路由器和流形感知密集路由器，将输入图像自适应分配给最相关的专家。核心是沿流形结构和感知粒度互补轴组织的判别专家阵列。

Result: 在广泛的生成模型上进行的大量实验表明，TrueMoE实现了优越的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TrueMoE通过多专家协作框架有效解决了合成图像检测中的泛化问题，为检测任务提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

### [66] [MCOD: The First Challenging Benchmark for Multispectral Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15753)
*Yang Li,Tingfa Xu,Shuyan Bai,Peifu Liu,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MCOD数据集，这是首个专门用于多光谱伪装目标检测的基准数据集，包含真实世界挑战场景和高质量像素级标注，通过实验证明多光谱模态能显著提升检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD基准数据集仅基于RGB，缺乏对多光谱方法的支持，限制了该领域的发展。多光谱图像提供丰富的光谱信息，有望增强前景-背景区分能力。

Method: 构建MCOD数据集，包含全面的挑战属性、多样化的真实场景和高质量像素级标注。在MCOD上评估了11种代表性COD方法，并分析多光谱模态的集成效果。

Result: 实验观察到由于任务难度增加，所有方法性能均下降，但集成多光谱模态显著缓解了这种性能退化。

Conclusion: MCOD为多光谱伪装目标检测研究提供了坚实基础，多光谱信息在增强检测鲁棒性方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态研究中的样方图像分析需要专家手动识别物种，效率低下。AI技术可以显著提高识别效率，扩大生态研究的范围和覆盖面积。

Method: 使用包含170万张单标签植物图像的大规模训练集，以及预训练的视觉Transformer模型，对高分辨率样方图像进行弱监督多标签分类。

Result: 挑战赛提供了数千张专家标注的多标签测试图像，涵盖800多个物种，为评估AI模型在植物物种识别方面的进展提供了基准。

Conclusion: PlantCLEF 2024挑战赛通过标准化数据集和评估方法，推动了AI在生态研究中的应用，为植物物种自动识别技术的发展提供了重要平台。

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants
and the results achieved.

TL;DR: VLM3D是一个新的文本到3D生成框架，通过将大型视觉语言模型集成到SDS流程中，解决了现有方法在语义对齐和3D空间一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于SDS的文本到3D生成方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖CLIP文本编码器导致语义对齐粗糙，难以处理细粒度提示；2）2D扩散先验缺乏明确的3D空间约束，导致几何不一致和对象关系不准确。

Method: 提出VLM3D框架，将大型视觉语言模型作为可微分的语义和空间先验集成到SDS流程中。基于开源的Qwen2.5-VL模型实现，利用其丰富的语言基础监督和空间理解能力。

Result: 在GPTeval3D基准测试中，VLM3D在多样对象和复杂场景上显著优于先前的SDS方法，在语义保真度、几何一致性和空间正确性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VLM3D通过集成视觉语言模型，有效提升了文本到3D生成的语义对齐精度和3D空间一致性，为复杂场景的生成提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

Motivation: Cutie和SAM2在视频对象分割中各有限制：Cutie特征容量有限，SAM2缺乏时序建模能力。需要结合两者的互补优势来提升分割性能。

Method: 1. 用SAM2的ViT编码器替换Cutie的编码器以增强特征表示 2. 引入运动预测模块提升时序稳定性 3. 采用Cutie、SAM2和SCOPE的集成策略

Conclusion: SCOPE框架通过结合Cutie和SAM2的互补优势，实现了鲁棒的视频对象分割，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegReg是一个分割驱动的图像配准框架，通过解剖学自适应正则化处理区域变化的变形，在心脏、腹部和肺部图像配准中优于现有方法2-12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法使用全局均匀平滑约束，无法适应解剖运动中复杂的区域变化变形特征。

Method: 首先将输入图像分割成解剖一致子区域，然后通过同一配准骨干网络计算优化的部分变形场，最后整合成全局变形场。

Result: 使用真实分割时达到98.23% Dice分数，在三个临床配准场景中优于现有方法2-12%，即使使用自动分割也表现良好。

Conclusion: SegReg将配准精度与分割质量呈近线性依赖关系，将配准挑战转化为分割问题。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

TL;DR: CBPNet是一个用于边缘设备的高效持续学习框架，通过自适应重新初始化未充分利用的参数来解决冻结预训练模型导致的塑性损失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人技术和自动驾驶等应用中对动态环境实时响应的需求，需要适合边缘设备的高效持续学习方法。冻结预训练模型虽然能避免灾难性遗忘，但会引入塑性损失的新瓶颈。

Method: 提出了Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet)，创新性地集成了高效的CBP模块，通过自适应重新初始化训练过程中未充分利用的参数来对抗塑性衰减。

Result: 在边缘设备上的实验结果显示，CBPNet在Split CIFAR-100上比强基线平均准确率提高超过1%，在更具挑战性的Split ImageNet-R上达到了69.41%的最先进准确率，仅需训练少于主干网络0.2%的额外参数。

Conclusion: CBPNet通过恢复模型的学习活力，有效解决了持续学习中的塑性损失问题，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感语义变化检测数据集存在变化类别有限、变化类型不足、缺乏细粒度类别定义等问题，同时现有方法未能充分利用变化信息，通常将其作为后处理步骤来增强空间一致性，限制了模型性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出了前景-背景协同引导的语义变化检测方法（FoBa），利用关注感兴趣区域的前景和富含上下文信息的背景来协同引导模型，缓解语义模糊性并增强检测细微变化的能力。同时引入了门控交互融合模块和简单的连续性损失来增强模型的检测性能。

Result: 在三个数据集（SECOND、JL1和提出的LevirSCD）上的大量实验表明，FoBa相比当前最先进方法取得了有竞争力的结果，SeK指标分别提升了1.48%、3.61%和2.81%。

Conclusion: LevirSCD数据集和FoBa方法有效解决了遥感语义变化检测中的数据和方法挑战，为实际应用提供了更好的支持，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/zmoka-zht/FoBa.

Motivation: 无监督学习中的泛化能力研究较少，现有UDG方法依赖域标签，但实际场景中域标签往往不可用。本文旨在解决无标签情况下的语义与变化分离问题。

Method: 提出MS-UDG模型，包含：(1)基于InfoNCE的目标实现充分性；(2)语义-变化解耦损失和基于重构的机制促进最小性。

Result: 在流行的无监督域泛化基准测试中达到新的SOTA，显著优于现有SSL和UDG方法。

Conclusion: 理论证明了最小充分语义表示能直接降低分布外风险，实践验证了该方法在无标签情况下的有效性。

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

Motivation: SAM在自然图像领域表现出强大的零样本分割能力，但在遥感数据上泛化能力不足，面临复杂地形、多尺度目标和时序动态等独特挑战。

Method: TASAM集成了三个轻量级模块：地形感知适配器（注入高程先验）、时序提示生成器（捕捉土地覆盖变化）和多尺度融合策略（增强细粒度目标分割），无需重新训练SAM主干网络。

Result: 在LoveDA、iSAID和WHU-CD三个遥感基准测试中，TASAM显著优于零样本SAM和任务特定模型，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: 研究证明了领域自适应增强对基础模型的价值，为构建更鲁棒的地理空间分割提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

Motivation: 当前视频理解方法面临两个关键挑战：(1) 处理密集视频内容时计算不可行性；(2) 通过朴素均匀采样策略难以识别语义重要帧。

Method: 采用三阶段可微分关键帧选择机制：TAD模块通过变化评分、拐点检测和优先蒸馏选择信息量最大的帧；KF-GRPO模块通过对比学习和显著性增强奖励机制，激励模型同时利用帧内容和时间关系。

Result: 在VideoMME上达到69.1%，在LVBench上达到52.7%，明显超越先前方法，使7B参数模型达到与72B参数模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL框架有效解决了视频理解中的计算效率和语义帧选择问题，在保持时间信息的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在显著的'品牌偏见'，即从通用提示中生成包含主导商业品牌的内容，这带来了伦理和法律风险。

Method: 使用轻量级检测器识别品牌内容，并通过视觉语言模型生成风格差异化的替代方案。引入品牌中立性评分来量化问题。

Result: 在领先的文本到图像模型上进行广泛实验，结果显示CIDER显著减少了显性和隐性偏见，同时保持了图像质量和美学吸引力。

Conclusion: CIDER为更原创和公平的内容提供了实用解决方案，有助于开发可信赖的生成式AI。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法面临两个主要挑战：难以处理3D高斯泼溅中的隐式空间纹理表示，需要逐场景训练；需要大量标注数据进行有效训练。

Method: 提出基于视图检索的定位方法，通过对象级视图检索从多个视角收集定位线索，将3D定位任务转化为2D检索任务。

Result: 实验表明该方法在避免逐场景训练的同时实现了最先进的视觉定位性能。

Conclusion: GVR为零样本3D视觉定位研究提供了坚实基础，消除了对3D标注和逐场景训练的依赖。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

TL;DR: ENSAM是一个轻量级、可提示的通用3D医学图像分割模型，采用SegResNet编码器结合提示编码器和掩码解码器的U-Net架构，在有限数据和计算资源下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个在有限数据和计算预算下仍能实现良好性能的通用3D医学图像分割模型，解决多模态医学图像分割的挑战。

Method: 结合SegResNet编码器、提示编码器和掩码解码器的U-Net架构，使用潜在交叉注意力、相对位置编码、归一化注意力和Muon优化器进行训练。

Result: 在CVPR 2025挑战赛隐藏测试集上，DSC AUC为2.404，NSD AUC为2.266，最终DSC为0.627，最终NSD为0.597，优于VISTA3D和SAM-Med3D基线模型，与SegVol相当。

Conclusion: ENSAM在有限计算资源下实现了竞争性的3D医学图像分割性能，相对位置编码和Muon优化器显著加速收敛并提高分割质量。

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a
lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation.
ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossI2P是一个自监督的端到端框架，通过跨模态学习和两阶段配准来解决图像到点云配准的挑战，显著提升了配准精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D图像和3D点云之间存在语义-几何鸿沟，现有方法容易陷入局部最优，需要克服这些限制以实现更鲁棒的跨模态感知。

Method: 采用双路径对比学习构建几何-语义融合嵌入空间，通过粗到精的配准范式（全局超点-超像素对应和几何约束的点级细化），并使用动态训练机制平衡不同损失。

Result: 在KITTI Odometry基准上性能提升23.7%，在nuScenes上提升37.9%，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CrossI2P通过统一的跨模态学习和两阶段配准框架，有效解决了图像到点云配准的关键挑战，为自主系统的鲁棒感知提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACap是一个关系感知的检索增强图像描述模型，通过挖掘检索描述中的结构化关系语义和识别图像中的异构对象，解决现有方法在关系建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强图像描述方法在关系建模方面存在挑战：语义提示表示过于粗粒度无法捕捉细粒度关系；缺乏对图像对象及其语义关系的显式建模。

Method: RACap模型不仅从检索描述中挖掘结构化关系语义，还识别图像中的异构对象，有效检索包含异构视觉信息的结构化关系特征，增强语义一致性和关系表达能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，RACap仅使用1080万个可训练参数，相比之前的轻量级描述模型取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: RACap通过关系感知的检索增强方法有效解决了图像描述中的关系建模问题，在保持模型轻量化的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个将SAM2视觉基础模型应用于LiDAR点云范围视图分割的框架，通过架构修改优化SAM2在范围视图表示上的性能，实现了竞争性的分割结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体素和点基方法计算成本高且实时效率有限，而范围视图方法可以利用成熟的2D分割技术实现快速准确预测。作者希望探索SAM2这一先进的视觉基础模型是否能成为LiDAR点云分割的强大骨干网络。

Method: 提出了首个将SAM2适配到3D分割的范围视图框架，包括：(1)强调LiDAR范围图像水平空间依赖性的新模块；(2)针对球面投影几何特性定制的配置；(3)专门设计用于捕捉范围视图伪图像独特空间模式的编码器机制。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上取得了竞争性的性能，同时受益于2D管线的速度、可扩展性和部署简单性。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了视觉基础模型作为3D感知通用骨干网络的可行性，为统一的、基础模型驱动的LiDAR分割开辟了道路，使用VFMs的范围视图分割方法带来了有希望的结果。

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

TL;DR: 提出了GREAT框架，通过三个注意力模块增强现有迭代立体匹配方法的全局上下文感知能力，在困难区域表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代立体匹配方法在遮挡、纹理缺失或重复模式等病态区域表现不佳，缺乏全局上下文和几何信息

Method: 提出GREAT框架包含三个注意力模块：空间注意力(SA)捕获空间维度全局上下文，匹配注意力(MA)沿极线提取全局上下文，体积注意力(VA)与前两者协同构建更鲁棒的成本体积

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得领先成绩：Scene Flow测试集、KITTI 2015和ETH3D排行榜第一，Middlebury基准第二

Conclusion: GREAT框架能有效提升迭代立体匹配方法在挑战性病态区域的性能，具有通用性和有效性

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

TL;DR: 深度反馈模型（DFMs）是一种新型的状态神经网络，通过结合自下而上的输入和高层表征的时间反馈机制，在静态架构中引入动态特性，能够迭代优化内部状态并模拟生物决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈神经网络缺乏动态反馈机制，无法模拟生物系统的迭代决策过程。研究者希望通过引入反馈机制来增强网络的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 将反馈过程建模为微分方程，通过循环神经网络求解，并使用指数衰减进行稳定化以确保收敛。

Result: 在物体识别和分割任务中，DFMs在低数据量和高噪声条件下显著优于前馈网络，特别是在医学影像应用中表现出对多种噪声类型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 反馈机制对于实现稳定、鲁棒和可泛化的学习至关重要，DFMs为神经网络架构设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D目标检测方法只能检测固定类别的物体，限制了应用范围。现有方法在稀疏视图（仅有少量RGB图像）场景下表现不佳，且需要大量3D数据训练。

Method: 采用无需训练的方法，利用预训练的2D基础模型，通过将2D检测结果提升到3D空间，并直接优化3D提案在不同视图间的特征一致性，充分利用2D数据的丰富性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在密集采样场景下与最先进技术竞争，在稀疏视图设置下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这种简单而有效的流水线为开集3D目标检测建立了强大的基线，特别是在稀疏视图场景中表现出色，证明了利用2D基础模型解决3D问题的可行性。

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

Motivation: 相机-雷达融合为3D目标检测提供了在恶劣天气和光照条件下的鲁棒且低成本的替代方案，但目前相关研究较少，需要开发新架构来充分利用雷达点云的优势（如精确距离估计和速度信息）。

Method: 提出新的主干网络将雷达柱特征映射到嵌入维度，使用自注意力机制建模雷达点间依赖关系，用简化的卷积层替代基于PointPillars架构中的FPN卷积层以减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D目标检测问题上实现了新的最先进性能，证明了相机-雷达融合的有效性和效率优势。

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

Conclusion: MTMS-YieldNet的优异性能改进了产量预测，为农民提供有价值的决策支持，有望提高作物产量。

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,
potentially improving crop yields.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

TL;DR: MuproCL提出了一种新的语言引导持续学习框架，用多个上下文感知原型替代单一语义目标，解决了语义歧义和类内视觉多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言引导持续学习方法依赖PLM的单一语义目标，存在语义歧义（多义词导致视觉表示冲突）和类内视觉多样性（单一原型无法捕捉类内丰富视觉外观）两个关键限制。

Method: 使用轻量级LLM代理进行类别消歧和视觉模态扩展，生成鲁棒的语义原型集，并通过LogSumExp聚合机制让视觉模型自适应地与最相关的原型对齐。

Result: 在多个CL基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MuproCL能持续提升性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MuproCL为语言引导的持续学习建立了一条更有效的路径。

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉基础模型的强大特征表示能力，结合知识蒸馏和模态信息注入，DistillMatch为多模态图像匹配提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出CauMVC，一种基于因果学习的多视图聚类方法，用于处理部分对齐数据的广义多视图聚类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中多视图数据往往只有部分对齐，而现有方法大多依赖完全对齐假设，导致聚类性能下降。

Method: 采用因果建模方法，将部分对齐数据视为干预，设计变分自编码器估计不变特征，并利用对比正则化捕获样本相关性。

Result: 在完全和部分对齐数据上的实验表明CauMVC具有强泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过因果学习处理广义多视图聚类的工作，为解决部分对齐问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLip是一个用于视觉语音识别的全局-局部集成渐进框架，通过双路径特征提取和两阶段学习策略，解决现实世界中的光照变化、遮挡、模糊和姿态变化等视觉挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VSR方法对现实世界中的视觉挑战（如光照变化、遮挡、模糊和姿态变化）关注有限，需要开发更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出GLip框架，包含双路径特征提取架构和两阶段渐进学习：第一阶段学习视觉特征与语音单元的粗对齐，第二阶段通过上下文增强模块动态整合局部特征与全局上下文。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并在新引入的挑战性普通话数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: GLip通过渐进学习策略有效利用判别性局部区域，在各种视觉挑战下展现出增强的鲁棒性，为鲁棒视觉语音识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于字典引导图卷积网络的表面重建方法，能够同时预测控制点的位置和数量，为噪声点云数据生成平滑表面，无需使用点法向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的点云数据存在噪声，现有数据驱动的表面重建算法严重依赖地面真实法向量或近似法向量作为中间步骤，这使得它们在噪声点云数据集上不可靠。B样条重建技术虽然提供紧凑的表面表示，但现有方法预测固定数量的控制点位置，难以匹配底层表面的复杂性。

Method: 开发了字典引导的图卷积网络策略，同时预测控制点的位置和数量，为噪声点云数据生成平滑表面，无需使用任何点法向量。

Result: 通过与多个知名和近期基线方法的比较，使用广泛采用的评估指标，证明该方法在定性和定量上都优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声点云表面重建方面表现出色，克服了现有方法对法向量的依赖和控制点数量固定的限制，实现了更好的重建效果。

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: LIR-GAD是一个基于多模态大语言模型的群体活动检测框架，通过引入活动级和群体级特殊令牌，结合语言指令进行推理，解决了现有方法在上下文推理和可解释性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法仅依赖视觉特征的隐式模式识别，在上下文推理和可解释性方面存在困难。本文旨在利用MLLM的常识知识来提升群体活动检测的性能和可解释性。

Method: 提出LIR-GAD框架，扩展MLLM词汇表引入<ACT>和<GROUP>令牌，结合视频帧和语言指令输入MLLM，并设计多模态双对齐融合模块整合MLLM隐藏嵌入和视觉特征。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在群体活动检测任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: LIR-GAD框架通过语言指导的推理机制，有效提升了群体活动检测的性能和可解释性，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前的研究通过引入深度信息或点云等模态来改进空间推理，但纯视觉空间理解仍然未被充分探索。SEE&TREK旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最大语义丰富度采样提取语义丰富的关键帧来捕捉场景结构，并通过模拟视觉轨迹和编码相对空间位置来保持空间关系和时间一致性。该方法无需训练和GPU，仅需单次前向传播。

Result: 在VSI-BENCH和STI-BENCH上的广泛实验表明，SEE&TREK在各种空间推理任务中持续提升多种MLLM的性能，最高提升达3.5%。

Conclusion: SEE&TREK为增强空间智能提供了一条有前景的路径，可以无缝集成到现有的MLLM中。

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion的新型自监督图像去噪框架，通过双分支扩散模型结合盲点网络和传统扩散模型，解决了盲点网络在细节保留和扩散模型自监督训练方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲点网络在图像去噪中牺牲局部细节和引入像素不连续性的问题，同时克服扩散模型在自监督去噪中难以适应的问题。

Method: 采用双分支扩散框架：一个基于盲点网络的扩散分支生成半干净图像，另一个传统扩散分支捕捉噪声分布。使用盲点网络分支指导采样过程，在保留局部细节的同时捕捉噪声结构。

Result: 在SIDD和DND数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，成为真实世界去噪的高效自监督解决方案。

Conclusion: Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion框架有效解决了自监督图像去噪中的关键挑战，在真实世界去噪任务中表现出色，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

TL;DR: AdaSports-Traj是一个自适应轨迹建模框架，专门解决多智能体体育场景中角色和领域间的分布差异问题，通过角色和领域感知适配器以及分层对比学习来实现跨角色和跨领域的轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体体育场景中的轨迹预测面临结构性异质性和动态分布差距的挑战，现有统一框架难以捕捉这些结构化分布变化，导致跨角色和跨领域的泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AdaSports-Traj框架，包含角色和领域感知适配器来条件调整潜在表示，并引入分层对比学习目标分别监督角色敏感和领域感知表示，实现解耦的潜在结构。

Result: 在Basketball-U、Football-U和Soccer-U三个多样化体育数据集上的实验表明，该框架在统一和跨领域轨迹预测设置中均取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: AdaSports-Traj通过自适应设计有效解决了体育场景中轨迹预测的分布差异问题，为跨角色和跨领域的轨迹建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDINO3D是一个新颖的Transformer编码器-解码器框架，用于3D实例分割。它通过利用预训练的2D检测模型的2D表示（包括图像级和对象级特征）来改进3D表示，在ScanNetV2和ScanNet200基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D训练数据通常不如2D训练图像充足，SegDINO3D旨在充分利用预训练2D检测模型的2D表示来改进3D表示。

Method: SegDINO3D采用点云和关联的2D图像作为输入。编码器阶段通过从对应图像视图检索2D图像特征来丰富每个3D点，然后使用3D编码器进行3D上下文融合。解码器阶段将3D对象查询制定为3D锚框，并执行从3D查询到使用2D检测模型从2D图像获得的2D对象查询的交叉注意力。

Result: SegDINO3D在ScanNetV2和ScanNet200 3D实例分割基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。在具有挑战性的ScanNet200数据集上，SegDINO3D在验证集和隐藏测试集上分别比先前方法显著提高了+8.7和+6.8 mAP。

Conclusion: SegDINO3D通过有效利用2D表示来增强3D实例分割，证明了其在处理3D数据不足问题上的优越性，特别是在具有挑战性的ScanNet200数据集上的显著性能提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

Motivation: 现有4D雷达3D检测器存在三个主要问题：1）基于pillar编码器的BEV特征提取导致特征图稀疏；2）边界框属性独立优化导致检测精度不理想；3）在车载嵌入式设备上难以满足实时性要求。

Method: 设计了Point Gaussian Encoder（PGE）将点转换为高斯原语，利用3D高斯溅射技术进行BEV栅格化；提出Box Gaussian Loss（BGL）将边界框转换为3D高斯分布进行距离度量，实现更全面的优化。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高精度的同时实现了快速推理，展现了在自动驾驶实时部署中的潜力。

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

TL;DR: Manzano是一个统一的多模态大语言模型框架，通过混合图像分词器和精心设计的训练方法，在图像理解和图像生成能力之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源多模态模型在图像理解和生成能力之间存在性能权衡问题，需要一个统一的框架来同时优化这两种能力。

Method: 使用共享视觉编码器配合两个轻量级适配器，分别产生连续嵌入用于图像理解，以及离散标记用于图像生成。采用统一的自动回归LLM预测文本和图像标记，并通过辅助扩散解码器将图像标记转换为像素。

Result: Manzano在统一模型中达到了最先进的性能，在文本丰富的评估中甚至能与专业模型竞争。研究表明任务冲突最小，模型规模扩展带来一致收益。

Conclusion: 混合分词器的设计选择得到验证，该框架能够实现图像理解和生成能力的可扩展联合学习。

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理图像输入时表现出的视觉谄媚行为，提出了"谄媚模态差距"概念，并开发了Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在基于图像输入的对话中表现出明显的视觉谄媚行为，这种行为比文本LLMs更为突出，需要深入理解和解决。

Method: 首先尝试了简单的监督微调，但发现会导致模型过度顽固。随后提出了Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法，让MLLM进行反思推理，判断用户指令是误导性还是纠正性的。

Result: 应用SRT后，MLLM对误导性指令的谄媚行为显著减少，同时不会对纠正性指令表现出过度顽固。

Conclusion: SRT方法有效缓解了MLLMs的视觉谄媚行为，平衡了对误导性指令的抵抗和对纠正性指令的接受能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级防御方法，通过张量分解技术过滤视觉语言模型中的对抗性噪声，无需重新训练即可提升模型鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法需要昂贵的重新训练或重大架构修改，而该方法旨在为预训练视觉语言模型提供即插即用的轻量级防御方案

Method: 使用张量分解和重构视觉编码器表示，通过低秩张量列车分解（秩8-32）和低残差强度（α=0.1-0.2）来过滤对抗性噪声

Result: 在Flickr30K上恢复12.3%的性能损失，Recall@1准确率从7.5%提升至19.8%；在COCO上恢复8.1%性能，准确率从3.8%提升至11.9%

Conclusion: 该方法是一种实用的即插即用解决方案，对现有视觉语言模型具有最小开销，能有效防御对抗性攻击

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像分割面临实际部署中模态不完整/损坏导致性能下降的挑战，现有方法需要为每种模态组合训练专门模型，部署成本高

Method: 采用分层自监督补偿(HSSC)策略，在输入、特征和输出三个层次上补偿完整与不完整模态之间的表示差距，包括模态重建、模态不变对比学习和轻量级反向注意力适配器

Result: 在MRI脑肿瘤分割、RGB-D语义分割、RGB-D/T显著目标分割等多个任务上，显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: UniMRSeg能够在各种模态缺失场景下实现稳定预测，无需为不同模态组合训练专门模型，大大降低了部署成本

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

Conclusion: 该优化方法解决了Otsu算法在大规模图像处理中的计算瓶颈问题，在保持原始方法理论基础和分割质量的同时，提供了适用于实时应用的确定性性能保证

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了空中物体抓取的关键挑战，提出的DIPP方法和构建的数据集为复杂空气动力学下的物体抓取提供了有效解决方案，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of in-flight object catching using a
quadruped robot with a basket. Our objective is to accurately predict the
impact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key
challenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under
unsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;
and the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when
trajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we
construct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing
a foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex
aerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),
consisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that
separates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and
generalization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the
impact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural
Acceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and
derives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that
directly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse
and complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on
both 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved
early-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments. The
demonstration is available at

Abstract: Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due
to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core
capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2)
absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering
cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and

Abstract: Teleoperated ultrasound can improve diagnostic medical imaging access for
remote communities. Having accurate force feedback is important for enabling
sonographers to apply the appropriate probe contact force to optimize
ultrasound image quality. However, large time delays in communication make
direct force feedback impractical. Prior work investigated using point
cloud-based model-mediated teleoperation and internal potential field models to
estimate contact forces and torques. We expand on this by introducing a method
to update the internal potential field model of the patient with measured
positions and forces for more transparent model-mediated tele-ultrasound. We
first generate a point cloud model of the patient's surface and transmit this
to the sonographer in a compact data structure. This is converted to a static
voxelized volume where each voxel contains a potential field value. These
values determine the forces and torques, which are rendered based on overlap
between the voxelized volume and a point shell model of the ultrasound
transducer. We solve for the potential field using a convex quadratic that
combines the spatial Laplace operator with measured forces. This was evaluated
on volunteer patients ($n=3$) by computing the accuracy of rendered forces.
Results showed the addition of measured forces to the model reduced the force
magnitude error by an average of 7.23 N and force vector angle error by an
average of 9.37$^{\circ}$ compared to using only Laplace's equation.

Conclusion: 该工作为人类-机器人交互中的影响力提供了一个透明且非战略性的框架，同时增强了安全性和效率

Abstract: Safe and efficient interaction between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and
human-driven vehicles (HVs) is a critical challenge for future transportation
systems. While game-theoretic models capture how AVs influence HVs, they often
suffer from a long-term decay of influence and can be perceived as
manipulative, eroding the human's trust. This can paradoxically lead to riskier
human driving behavior over repeated interactions. In this paper, we address
this challenge by proposing the Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion
(TA-EBP) framework. Our work makes three key contributions: First, we apply
Bayesian persuasion to model communication at traffic intersections, offering a
transparent alternative to traditional game-theoretic models. Second, we
introduce a trust parameter to the persuasion framework, deriving a theorem for
the minimum trust level required for influence. Finally, we ground the abstract
signals of Bayesian persuasion theory into a continuous, physically meaningful
action space, deriving a second theorem for the optimal signal magnitude,
realized as an AV's forward nudge. Additionally, we validate our framework in a
mixed-autonomy traffic simulation, demonstrating that TA-EBP successfully
persuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminating collisions and improving
traffic flow compared to baselines that either ignore trust or lack
communication. Our work provides a transparent and non-strategic framework for
influence in human-robot interaction, enhancing both safety and efficiency.

Conclusion: Sym2Real为真实世界机器人控制提供了一种数据高效且鲁棒的解决方案，成功实现了从仿真到真实的迁移学习。

Abstract: We present Sym2Real, a fully data-driven framework that provides a principled
way to train low-level adaptive controllers in a highly data-efficient manner.
Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor
and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning.
Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to
real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct
application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to
unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often
shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we
strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world
residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar
platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six
out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across
five real-world conditions. More information and videos can be found at at

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential
for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous
racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC
cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation
methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or
require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight
approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies
solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special
dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip
events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions,
and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under
no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across
different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results
closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the
potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for
real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous
driving.

issue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel
efficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and
dynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation
and a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In
dynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting
network to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After
fine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically
feasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be
directly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We
conduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size
humanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

*Reza Pirayeshshirazinezhad,Nima Fathi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释AI增强的多智能体机器人监督控制框架，结合定时自动机监督器、鲁棒连续控制和可解释预测器，在航天器编队飞行和自主水下航行器两个领域验证了方法的有效性和可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对安全关键、资源受限的多智能体机器人系统，需要开发既能够保证安全性和鲁棒性，又具有可解释性的控制框架，以支持实时决策和性能权衡。

Method: 框架包含三个核心组件：(1)定时自动机监督器用于安全模式切换；(2)鲁棒连续控制（大角度机动的李雅普诺夫控制器和带边界层的滑模控制器）；(3)可解释预测器将任务上下文映射到增益和预期性能。通过蒙特卡洛驱动的优化生成训练数据。

Result: 在航天器任务中，滑模控制器实现了亚毫米级对齐，跟踪误差比PD控制器降低21.7%，能耗降低81.4%。在AUV跟随测试中，相同结构的滑模控制器在随机水流下保持固定偏移，具有有界稳态误差。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可移植性和可解释性，适用于具有不确定6自由度刚体动力学、相对运动和紧密跟踪需求的一般机器人系统，为安全关键的多智能体机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for
multi-agent robotics that combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe,
auditable mode switching, (ii) robust continuous control (Lyapunov-based
controller for large-angle maneuver; sliding-mode controller (SMC) with
boundary layers for precision and disturbance rejection), and (iii) an
explainable predictor that maps mission context to gains and expected
performance (energy, error). Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the
training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs.
  We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation
flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different
environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share
uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion,
and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic
systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that
meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure
maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error.
In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment
with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to
Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV
tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results
highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for
safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.

Abstract: In emergency response missions, first responders must navigate cluttered
indoor environments where occlusions block direct line-of-sight, concealing
both life-threatening hazards and victims in need of rescue. We present STARC,
a see-through AR framework for human-robot collaboration that fuses
mobile-robot mapping with responder-mounted LiDAR sensing. A ground robot
running LiDAR-inertial odometry performs large-area exploration and 3D human
detection, while helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR on the responder is
registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. This
cross-LiDAR alignment enables consistent first-person projection of detected
humans and their point clouds - rendered in AR with low latency - into the
responder's view. By providing real-time visualization of hidden occupants and
hazards, STARC enhances situational awareness and reduces operator risk.
Experiments in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials confirm robust
pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable overlays, underscoring the
potential of our system for fire-fighting, disaster relief, and other
safety-critical operations. Code and design will be open-sourced upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过捕捉多模态解分布有效解决了模糊场景下的数据关联问题，优于传统的单一解方法。

Abstract: Global data association is an essential prerequisite for robot operation in
environments seen at different times or by different robots. Repetitive or
symmetric data creates significant challenges for existing methods, which
typically rely on maximum likelihood estimation or maximum consensus to produce
a single set of associations. However, in ambiguous scenarios, the distribution
of solutions to global data association problems is often highly multimodal,
and such single-solution approaches frequently fail. In this work, we introduce
a data association framework that leverages approximate Bayesian inference to
capture multiple solution modes to the data association problem, thereby
avoiding premature commitment to a single solution under ambiguity. Our
approach represents hypothetical solutions as particles that evolve according
to a deterministic or randomized update rule to cover the modes of the
underlying solution distribution. Furthermore, we show that our method can
incorporate optimization constraints imposed by the data association
formulation and directly benefit from GPU-parallelized optimization. Extensive
simulated and real-world experiments with highly ambiguous data show that our
method correctly estimates the distribution over transformations when
registering point clouds or object maps.

Motivation: 针对视觉障碍辅助导航场景中轨迹规划需要兼顾平滑性、安全性和实时性的挑战，传统方法在复杂环境下存在收敛慢、稳定性差的问题。

Method: 采用双阶段优化：第一阶段在Frenet坐标系中使用三阶插值和五阶多项式生成启发式轨迹采样簇，第二阶段在笛卡尔坐标系中使用基于LSTM的残差增强actor-critic网络进行自适应轨迹精炼，并通过双阶段成本建模机制实现语义优先级对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂辅助规划任务中有效提升了鲁棒性、安全性和实时可行性，为视觉障碍导航提供了可靠的轨迹优化解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a momentum-constrained hybrid heuristic trajectory
optimization framework (MHHTOF) tailored for assistive navigation in visually
impaired scenarios, integrating trajectory sampling generation, optimization
and evaluation with residual-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the
first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the
Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order
polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints
to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the
second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based
temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the
Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with
weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting
human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable
policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by
the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and
training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces
average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle
risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in
enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive
planning tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle localization using roadside LiDARs can provide centimeter-level
accuracy for cloud-controlled vehicles while simultaneously serving multiple
vehicles, enhanc-ing safety and efficiency. While most existing studies rely on
repetitive scanning LiDARs, non-repetitive scanning LiDAR offers advantages
such as eliminating blind zones and being more cost-effective. However, its
application in roadside perception and localization remains limited. To address
this, we present a dataset for infrastructure-based vehicle localization, with
data collected from both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning LiDARs, in
order to benchmark the performance of different LiDAR scanning patterns. The
dataset contains 5,445 frames of point clouds across eight vehicle trajectory
sequences, with diverse trajectory types. Our experiments establish base-lines
for infrastructure-based vehicle localization and compare the performance of
these methods using both non-repetitive and repetitive scanning LiDARs. This
work offers valuable insights for selecting the most suitable LiDAR scanning
pattern for infrastruc-ture-based vehicle localization. Our dataset is a
signifi-cant contribution to the scientific community, supporting advancements
in infrastructure-based perception and vehicle localization. The dataset and

Abstract: Efficiently delivering items to an ongoing surgery in a hospital operating
room can be a matter of life or death. In modern hospital settings, delivery
robots have successfully transported bulk items between rooms and floors.
However, automating item-level operating room logistics presents unique
challenges in perception, efficiency, and maintaining sterility. We propose the

contributions of this paper include: (1) a modular software architecture
facilitating robust mobile manipulation through behavior trees; (2) a novel
real-time object recognition pipeline integrating YOLOv7, Segment Anything
Model 2 (SAM2), and Grounded DINO; (3) the adaptation of the cuRobo
parallelized trajectory optimization framework to real-time, collision-free
mobile manipulation; and (4) empirical validation demonstrating an 80% success
rate in OR supply retrieval and a 96% success rate in restocking operations.
These contributions establish ORB as a reliable and adaptable system for
autonomous OR logistics.

Conclusion: PRIMT框架通过有效利用基础模型和多模态反馈，显著提升了基于偏好的强化学习的性能，为解决传统PbRL的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising
paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors without reward engineering.
However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the
reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving
query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we
introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by
leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and
trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM
evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy,
integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and
vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and
comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory
generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the
trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory
augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary
loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6
manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance
over FM-based and scripted baselines.

Motivation: 现有磁性微型机器人在手术应用中存在功能受限（最多两种功能）和运动自由度不足（五自由度）的问题，且需要近距离强磁场操作，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 开发了一种毫米级软体机器人，其磁化特性可被重新编程，通过相对均匀且较弱的磁场（最多65 mT和1.5 T/m）实现六自由度运动控制。

Abstract: Miniature robots are untethered actuators, which have significant potential
to make existing minimally invasive surgery considerably safer and painless,
and enable unprecedented treatments because they are much smaller and dexterous
than existing surgical robots. Of the miniature robots, the magnetically
actuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic
miniature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either
restricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited
five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion. Some of these actuators are also only
operational under specialized environments where actuation from strong external
magnets must be at very close proximity (< 4 cm away). Here we present a
millimeter-scale soft robot where its magnetization profile can be reprogrammed
upon command to perform five surgical functionalities: drug-dispensing, cutting
through biological tissues (simulated with gelatin), gripping, storing
(biological) samples and remote heating. By possessing full six-DOF motions,
including the sixth-DOF rotation about its net magnetic moment, our soft robot
can also roll and two-anchor crawl across challenging unstructured
environments, which are impassable by its five-DOF counterparts. Because our
actuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and
1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues
harmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of
the human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the
advancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive
treatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented
functionalities.

Abstract: Visual observations from different viewpoints can significantly influence the
performance of visuomotor policies in robotic manipulation. Among these,
egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise
control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand
cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and
cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception -
enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference
time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned
diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand
views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a
pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate
our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and
real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking
task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy
inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of
real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution
for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of
imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.

Abstract: Effective robotic manipulation relies on a precise understanding of 3D scene
geometry, and one of the most straightforward ways to acquire such geometry is
through multi-view observations. Motivated by this, we present GP3 -- a 3D
geometry-aware robotic manipulation policy that leverages multi-view input. GP3
employs a spatial encoder to infer dense spatial features from RGB
observations, which enable the estimation of depth and camera parameters,
leading to a compact yet expressive 3D scene representation tailored for
manipulation. This representation is fused with language instructions and
translated into continuous actions via a lightweight policy head. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on simulated benchmarks. Furthermore, GP3 transfers effectively to
real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring
only minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight GP3 as a practical,

resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale
coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and
Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based
search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible
multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes
using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A*
search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex
optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing
robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem
into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates
the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision
avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On
50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles,
while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves
above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles,
with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only
approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates
vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent
coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further
validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while
preserving cooperative behaviors.

TL;DR: FlyKites是一个面向多机器人系统在有限通信条件下的人机交互探索与协助框架，包含分布式探索、中继拓扑优化和人机在线执行三个核心组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端环境（如洞穴、地下隧道）中，机器人只能通过ad-hoc网络进行近距离通信，当遇到未知目标、阻塞通道等需要人类协助的情况时，通信受限成为主要挑战。

Method: 框架包含三个交替组件：(I)分布式探索和间歇通信（扩展模式）-机器人协作探索环境并与操作员交换数据；(II)同时优化中继拓扑、操作员路径和机器人角色分配（中继模式）-最小化协助延迟；(III)人在回路在线执行-机器人自适应切换角色并与操作员交互。

Conclusion: FlyKites框架有效解决了多机器人系统在有限通信条件下的人机交互探索问题，通过自适应角色切换和中继优化实现了高效的人类协助。

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown
scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may
encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects,
temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent
human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however
can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is
severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks,
especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This
paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance
framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication.
It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration
and intermittent communication (called the "spread mode"), where the robots
collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet
and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay
topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles
(called the "relay mode"), such that all requested assistance can be provided
with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the
robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator
adaptively. Extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments
are performed over numerous challenging scenes.

Motivation: 无人机在最后一公里配送中展现出速度、安全和成本优势，特别是在疫情期间的紧急医疗配送中。但多包裹配送面临时间敏感性和能源限制的新挑战，需要优化配送策略。

Abstract: Drones have recently emerged as a faster, safer, and cost-efficient way for
last-mile deliveries of parcels, particularly for urgent medical deliveries
highlighted during the pandemic. This paper addresses a new challenge of
multi-parcel delivery with a swarm of energy-aware drones, accounting for
time-sensitive customer requirements. Each drone plans an optimal multi-parcel
route within its battery-restricted flight range to minimize delivery delays
and reduce energy consumption. The problem is tackled by decomposing it into
three sub-problems: (1) optimizing depot locations and service areas using
K-means clustering; (2) determining the optimal flight range for drones through
reinforcement learning; and (3) planning and selecting multi-parcel delivery
routes via a new optimized plan selection approach. To integrate these
solutions and enhance long-term efficiency, we propose a novel algorithm
leveraging actor-critic-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
Extensive experimentation using realistic delivery datasets demonstrate an
exceptional performance of the proposed algorithm. We provide new insights into
economic efficiency (minimize energy consumption), rapid operations (reduce
delivery delays and overall execution time), and strategic guidance on depot
deployment for practical logistics applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉抓取系统受校准误差、传感器噪声和抓取姿态预测不准确等限制，导致最终抓取阶段存在不可避免的接触不确定性。高带宽触觉反馈与触觉反应控制器结合可显著提高感知误差下的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计纯触觉反馈的抓取调整算法，在15自由度臂手系统（含8自由度手）上进行仿真和真实实验，指尖触觉传感器以200Hz频率运行。

Result: 通过仿真和真实实验证明，该触觉反应抓取框架有效提高了抓取稳定性。

Conclusion: 触觉反馈控制器能够在不依赖物体几何先验知识和精确初始抓取姿态的情况下，成功优化抓取配置，提升抓取鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-only grasping systems are fundamentally constrained by calibration
errors, sensor noise, and grasp pose prediction inaccuracies, leading to
unavoidable contact uncertainty in the final stage of grasping. High-bandwidth
tactile feedback, when paired with a well-designed tactile-reactive controller,
can significantly improve robustness in the presence of perception errors. This
paper contributes to controller design by proposing a purely tactile-feedback
grasp-adjustment algorithm. The proposed controller requires neither prior
knowledge of the object's geometry nor an accurate grasp pose, and is capable
of refining a grasp even when starting from a crude, imprecise initial
configuration and uncertain contact points. Through simulation studies and
real-world experiments on a 15-DoF arm-hand system (featuring an 8-DoF hand)
equipped with fingertip tactile sensors operating at 200 Hz, we demonstrate
that our tactile-reactive grasping framework effectively improves grasp
stability.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了将几何感知视觉表示集成到机器人模仿学习中，提出了高效的几何感知编码器eVGGT，相比传统视觉编码器在机器人操作任务中取得了6.5%的成功率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RGB的模仿学习方法使用传统视觉编码器（如ResNet或ViT）缺乏显式的3D推理能力，而几何感知的视觉模型能提供更强的空间理解能力。

Method: 将几何感知视觉编码器集成到模仿学习框架（ACT和DP）中，并提出了eVGGT——一个从VGGT蒸馏得到的高效几何感知编码器，体积缩小5倍，速度提升9倍。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的单臂和双臂操作任务中，几何感知编码器比标准视觉编码器成功率提升最高达6.5%。eVGGT在保持强3D推理能力的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 几何感知视觉表示能显著提升机器人模仿学习的性能，eVGGT为实际机器人系统的部署提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing RGB-based imitation learning approaches typically employ traditional
vision encoders such as ResNet or ViT, which lack explicit 3D reasoning
capabilities. Recent geometry-grounded vision models, such as
VGGT~\cite{wang2025vggt}, provide robust spatial understanding and are
promising candidates to address this limitation. This work investigates the
integration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation.
Our results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into
imitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5%
improvement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and
bi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.
Despite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high
computational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems. To
address this challenge, we propose eVGGT, an efficient geometry-aware encoder
distilled from VGGT. eVGGT is nearly 9 times faster and 5 times smaller than
VGGT, while preserving strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Code and pretrained
models will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware
robotics.

Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for efficient
navigation of mobile robots in cluttered environments. The proposed approach
integrates a finite-segment shortest path planner into the finite-horizon
trajectory optimization of the MPC. This formulation ensures convergence to
dynamically selected targets and guarantees collision avoidance, even under
general nonlinear dynamics and cluttered environments. The approach is
validated through hardware experiments on a small ground robot, where a human
operator dynamically assigns target locations. The robot successfully navigated
through complex environments and reached new targets within 2-3 seconds.

TL;DR: VLAC是一个基于InternVL构建的通用过程奖励模型，通过大规模异构数据集训练，能够为机器人视觉-语言-动作强化学习提供密集的进度奖励信号，无需任务特定的奖励工程，并支持一次性上下文迁移到未见过的任务和环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人真实世界强化学习中稀疏、手工设计的奖励和低效探索的问题，通过构建通用过程奖励模型来消除任务特定的奖励工程需求。

Method: 在InternVL基础上构建VLAC模型，使用大规模异构数据集训练，包括视觉语言数据集（增强感知、对话和推理能力）、机器人和人类轨迹数据（基础动作生成和进度估计），并构建大量负样本和语义不匹配样本来增强模型拒绝无关提示和检测回归/停滞的能力。通过提示控制，单个VLAC模型交替生成奖励和动作标记，统一评论家和策略。在异步真实世界强化学习循环中部署，结合分级的人类参与协议（离线演示回放、返回和探索、人类引导探索）来加速探索和稳定早期学习。

Result: 在四个不同的真实世界操作任务中，VLAC将成功率从约30%提升到约90%（在200个真实世界交互周期内）；结合人类参与干预进一步提高了50%的样本效率，并实现了高达100%的最终成功率。

Conclusion: VLAC通过通用过程奖励模型和人类参与协议，显著提升了机器人真实世界强化学习的效率和性能，证明了其在消除奖励工程需求和实现高效探索方面的有效性。

Abstract: Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action
(VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient
exploration. We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon
InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise
observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done
signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot
in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on
vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning
capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground
action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to
reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by
constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples.
With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and
action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous
real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline
demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that
accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct
real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to
about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating
human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample
efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.

Motivation: 衣物翻面是一个具有挑战性的动态操作任务，涉及快速接触变化和严重视觉遮挡，需要一种无需人工演示的解决方案

Method: 将任务分解为Drag/Fling和Insert&Pull两个步骤，使用深度推断的关键点参数化双手机器人基元；构建基于MPM的高保真模拟器进行自动化数据生成

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和高保真模拟，该框架能够处理高度动态、严重遮挡的任务，无需繁琐的人工演示

Abstract: Turning garments right-side out is a challenging manipulation task: it is
highly dynamic, entails rapid contact changes, and is subject to severe visual
occlusion. We introduce Right-Side-Out, a zero-shot sim-to-real framework that
effectively solves this challenge by exploiting task structures. We decompose
the task into Drag/Fling to create and stabilize an access opening, followed by
Insert&Pull to invert the garment. Each step uses a depth-inferred,
keypoint-parameterized bimanual primitive that sharply reduces the action space
while preserving robustness. Efficient data generation is enabled by our
custom-built, high-fidelity, GPU-parallel Material Point Method (MPM) simulator
that models thin-shell deformation and provides robust and efficient contact
handling for batched rollouts. Built on the simulator, our fully automated
pipeline scales data generation by randomizing garment geometry, material
parameters, and viewpoints, producing depth, masks, and per-primitive keypoint
labels without any human annotations. With a single depth camera, policies
trained entirely in simulation deploy zero-shot on real hardware, achieving up
to 81.3% success rate. By employing task decomposition and high fidelity
simulation, our framework enables tackling highly dynamic, severely occluded
tasks without laborious human demonstrations.

TL;DR: Swarm Oracle 是一个去中心化的机器人网络，利用机器人集群的传感器和点对点通信来验证现实世界数据并提供给区块链智能合约，解决了区块链无法直接访问现实世界数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链共识机制限制了访问现实世界数据的能力，现有预言机解决方案可能降低自主性、透明度或重新引入信任需求。需要一种既能提供可靠数据又保持去中心化特性的解决方案。

Method: 采用拜占庭容错协议，让来自不同利益相关方的机器人协同工作，通过集体验证达成比单个机器人更高质量的社会共识。结合基于区块链代币的声誉系统，使系统能够从故障和攻击中自主恢复。

Result: 通过真实和模拟机器人的广泛实验证明，即使在大量机器人发起多种类型攻击的情况下，仍能就不确定的环境信息达成共识，系统能够自主恢复。

Conclusion: Swarm Oracle 利用机器人集群的固有去中心化、容错性和移动性，为区块链提供了一种安全、无需信任的全球共识机制，能够灵活适应远程位置的信息请求。

Abstract: Blockchain consensus, rooted in the principle ``don't trust, verify'', limits
access to real-world data, which may be ambiguous or inaccessible to some
participants. Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains,
but existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the
need for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous
robots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer
communication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart
contracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in
decentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can
flexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote
locations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates
robots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party
biases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the
secure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a
Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different
stakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality
than the estimates of individual robots. Through extensive experiments using
both real and simulated robots, we showcase how consensus on uncertain
environmental information can be achieved, despite several types of attacks
orchestrated by large proportions of the robots, and how a reputation system
based on blockchain tokens lets Swarm Oracle autonomously recover from faults
and attacks, a requirement for long-term operation.

TL;DR: CoReVLA是一个持续学习的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过数据收集和行为优化两阶段过程，提升自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中的性能仍然有限，这些罕见情况导致了不成比例的事故数量。视觉语言动作模型具有强大的推理能力，但受限于高质量数据的缺乏和在这些条件下的低效学习。

Method: 采用双阶段过程：首先在开源驾驶问答数据集上进行联合微调，然后在CAVE仿真平台中收集驾驶员接管数据，最后通过直接偏好优化进行模型优化，避免手动设计奖励导致的奖励黑客问题。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CoReVLA实现了72.18的驾驶分数和50%的成功率，在长尾安全关键场景下分别比最先进方法高出7.96分和15%。案例研究显示模型能够利用过去的接管经验持续改进在类似易失败场景中的性能。

Conclusion: CoReVLA框架能够准确感知驾驶场景并做出适当决策，通过持续学习机制有效提升了自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their
performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare
cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action
(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,
but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and
inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework
that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage
process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly
fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to
acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is
deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation
platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.
Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle
reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid
reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and
closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can
accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the
Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a
Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and
15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies
demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in
similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences. All

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automating labor-intensive
and complex activities, i.e., those consisting of multiple atomic tasks, by
deploying robots in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as industrial
and agricultural settings. A key characteristic of these contexts is that
activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible
tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover,
despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the
progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future
actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of
safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture
that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling
humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using
natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also
present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art
components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision
agriculture scenario.

Motivation: 在人类互动中，身高较高的人通常被认为更具说服力。本研究旨在验证这种身高效应是否在人与高度非人形机器人的互动中同样存在。

Method: 设计了一个模块化移动服务机器人，通过增减模块改变高度（95cm和132cm）。在实验中，机器人邀请参与者自愿完成300个问题的问卷，比较两种高度条件下的服从率。

Result: 较矮的机器人获得了更高的服从率，这与人类社交动态中的身高效应相反。

Conclusion: 身高对人机互动有重要影响，但这种影响遵循独特模式。设计者不能简单地将人类社交动态元素直接应用于机器人设计，需要先进行测试。

Abstract: Robots come in various forms and have different characteristics that may
shape the interaction with them. In human-human interactions, height is a
characteristic that shapes human dynamics, with taller people typically
perceived as more persuasive. In this work, we aspired to evaluate if the same
impact replicates in a human-robot interaction and specifically with a highly
non-humanoid robotic object. The robot was designed with modules that could be
easily added or removed, allowing us to change its height without altering
other design features. To test the impact of the robot's height, we evaluated
participants' compliance with its request to volunteer to perform a tedious
task. In the experiment, participants performed a cognitive task on a computer,
which was framed as the main experiment. When done, they were informed that the
experiment was completed. While waiting to receive their credits, the robotic
object, designed as a mobile robotic service table, entered the room, carrying
a tablet that invited participants to complete a 300-question questionnaire
voluntarily. We compared participants' compliance in two conditions: A Short
robot composed of two modules and 95cm in height and a Tall robot consisting of
three modules and 132cm in height. Our findings revealed higher compliance with
the Short robot's request, demonstrating an opposite pattern to human dynamics.
We conclude that while height has a substantial social impact on human-robot
interactions, it follows a unique pattern of influence. Our findings suggest
that designers cannot simply adopt and implement elements from human social
dynamics to robots without testing them first.

Method: 训练残差神经网络预测机器人-障碍物间隙，定义局部安全球半径，将其编码为离散时间高阶控制屏障函数，并融入非线性优化框架，采用松弛技术提高可行性。

Result: 实验显示毫秒级求解时间和高预测精度，能够处理任意（包括非凸）几何形状，在杂乱环境中生成无碰撞、动态可行的轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了离散时间控制与连续时间安全之间的差距，在安全性和效率方面超越了现有的CBF方法。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is central to safe navigation, especially for robots with
arbitrary and nonconvex geometries operating in cluttered environments.
Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) approaches often rely on analytic
clearance computations, which are infeasible for complex geometries, or on
polytopic approximations, which become intractable when robot configurations
are unknown. To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural
network on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and
tractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted
clearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures
continuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a
Discrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into
a nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation
technique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's
rigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free,
effectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show
that the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot
geometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in
cluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times
and high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond
existing CBF-based methods.

Abstract: A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the
ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While
prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences
pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves
remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution
shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene
graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations,
thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea,
we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural
networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused"
scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner.
Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate
substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines,
highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in
long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模仿学习的多用途运动策略方法，用于解决人形和四足机器人的复杂运动控制问题，通过潜在空间控制技能执行，并扩展了原始方法以处理约束条件和提高模仿质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度强化学习等控制方法主要关注单一技能，对于需要考虑高层目标、物理机器人限制和期望运动风格的复杂任务效率低下。需要一种更有效的方法来训练多用途运动策略。

Method: 首先通过模仿训练获得低层技能的多用途运动策略，提供技能执行的潜在空间控制；然后使用该策略高效解决下游任务。扩展原始方法以处理约束条件确保部署安全，并使用扩散判别器提高模仿质量。

Result: 在H1人形机器人和Solo12四足机器人的仿真中成功执行了运动操作任务，并将策略部署到Solo12硬件上。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将计算机图形学中的人物控制方法应用于人形和四足机器人的运动操作控制，验证了其在仿真和实际硬件上的有效性。

Abstract: Although humanoid and quadruped robots provide a wide range of capabilities,
current control methods, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, focus mainly on
single skills. This approach is inefficient for solving more complicated tasks
where high-level goals, physical robot limitations and desired motion style
might all need to be taken into account. A more effective approach is to first
train a multipurpose motion policy that acquires low-level skills through
imitation, while providing latent space control over skill execution. Then,
this policy can be used to efficiently solve downstream tasks. This method has
already been successful for controlling characters in computer graphics. In
this work, we apply the approach to humanoid and quadrupedal loco-manipulation
by imitating either simple synthetic motions or kinematically retargeted dog
motions. We extend the original formulation to handle constraints, ensuring
deployment safety, and use a diffusion discriminator for better imitation
quality. We verify our methods by performing loco-manipulation in simulation
for the H1 humanoid and Solo12 quadruped, as well as deploying policies on
Solo12 hardware. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Learning whole-body mobile manipulation via imitation is essential for
generalizing robotic skills to diverse environments and complex tasks. However,
this goal is hindered by significant challenges, particularly in effectively
processing complex observation, achieving robust generalization, and generating
coherent actions. To address these issues, we propose DSPv2, a novel policy
architecture. DSPv2 introduces an effective encoding scheme that aligns 3D
spatial features with multi-view 2D semantic features. This fusion enables the
policy to achieve broad generalization while retaining the fine-grained
perception necessary for precise control. Furthermore, we extend the Dense
Policy paradigm to the whole-body mobile manipulation domain, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating coherent and precise actions for the whole-body
robotic platform. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both task performance and generalization
ability. Project page is available at: https://selen-suyue.github.io/DSPv2Net/.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出I-FailSense框架，用于检测语言条件机器人操作中的语义错位失败，通过后训练基础VLM和轻量级分类头实现，在多个环境中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在机器人任务规划和空间推理方面有显著进步，但在检测自身失败方面能力有限，特别是语义错位错误（机器人执行语义上有意义但与指令不一致的任务）的检测是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 从现有语言条件操作数据集构建语义错位失败检测数据集；提出I-FailSense开源VLM框架，包括后训练基础VLM，然后在VLM不同内部层附加轻量级分类头（FS块），通过集成机制聚合预测结果。

Result: I-FailSense在检测语义错位错误方面优于同类规模和更大规模的最先进VLM；仅训练语义错位检测就能泛化到更广泛的机器人失败类别，并在其他仿真环境和真实世界中实现零样本或最小后训练的有效迁移。

Conclusion: I-FailSense框架有效解决了语义错位失败检测问题，具有优秀的泛化能力和迁移性能，相关数据集和模型已在HuggingFace公开。

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not
only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust
deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning
and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability
to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored
challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot
executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given
instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets
targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing
language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an
open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for
failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by
training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to
different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using
an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms
state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting
semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic
misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure
categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and
real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are
publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage:
https://clemgris.github.io/I-FailSense/).

Abstract: Unsteady aerodynamic effects can have a profound impact on aerial vehicle
flight performance, especially during agile maneuvers and in complex

relies on a lightweight vortex particle model, parallelized to allow GPU
acceleration, and a sampling-based policy optimization strategy capable of
leveraging the vortex particle model for predictive reasoning. We demonstrate,
through both simulation and hardware experiments, that by replanning with our
unsteady aerodynamics model, we can improve the performance of aggressive
post-stall maneuvers in the presence of unsteady environmental flow
disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用臂载微型飞行时间传感器检测和定位机器人手臂附近物体的方法，通过建立机器人自身传感器测量模型来区分机器人本体和外部物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决臂载传感器在测量中难以区分机器人自身和外部物体的关键挑战，提高机器人避障和人机交互的安全性。

Method: 利用现成的低分辨率飞行时间传感器的原始数据，建立机器人单独存在时的传感器测量经验模型，在运行时使用该模型检测机器人附近的物体。

Conclusion: 该方法避免了常见传感器配置中的机器人自检测问题，提供了传感器布置的额外灵活性，在碰撞避免和安全人机交互方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We provide a method for detecting and localizing objects near a robot arm
using arm-mounted miniature time-of-flight sensors. A key challenge when using
arm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external
objects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a
computationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight
information captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight
sensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the
presence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in
proximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common
sensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor
placement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a
radius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm
and localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to
reasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to
object type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors
on performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has
potential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe
human-robot interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的奖励设计方法存在幻觉问题、依赖人类反馈以及难以处理复杂多步任务的挑战，需要更有效的自动化奖励函数设计解决方案。

Method: RE-GoT将任务分解为文本属性图进行综合分析，生成奖励函数，然后利用VLM的视觉反馈进行迭代优化，无需人工干预。

Result: 在10个RoboGen和4个ManiSkill2任务上的实验显示，RE-GoT平均任务成功率分别提升32.25%和达到93.73%，显著超越现有LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 将LLM和VLM与图思维推理相结合，为强化学习中的自主奖励演化提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a major challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), often requiring considerable human expertise and
iterative refinement. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations,
reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step
tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts
(RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured
graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for
automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into
text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function
generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from
VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4
ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing
LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates
by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2,
RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse
manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and
even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining
LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and
effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.

Method: 基于哈密顿原理严格推导出鱼游全身体动力学模型，捕捉柔性鱼体的连续分布弹性和大变形，并包含流固耦合效应，无需预设运动学即可实现自推进运动。

Result: 仿真结果表明游泳速度和能量效率随尾拍频率呈现相反趋势，身体刚度和体长都存在最优值。驱动频率增加会提高速度但降低效率。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解生物游泳机制提供了见解，并为高性能软体机器鱼的设计提供了指导，揭示了游泳性能与身体参数之间的优化关系。

Abstract: Fish-inspired aquatic robots are gaining increasing attention in research
communities due to their high swimming speeds and efficient propulsion enabled
by flexible bodies that generate undulatory motions. To support the design
optimizations and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and
computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is
indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for fish
swimming, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the
continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large
deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling
self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. A preliminary parameter
study explores the influence of actuation frequency and body stiffness on
swimming speed and cost of transport (COT). Simulation results indicate that
swimming speed and energy efficiency exhibit opposing trends with tail-beat
frequency and that both body stiffness and body length have distinct optimal
values. These findings provide insights into biological swimming mechanisms and
inform the design of high-performance soft robotic swimmers.

Abstract: We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic
Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by
natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main
limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require
manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent,
which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we
propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models
(VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable
indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language
retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian
optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a
motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC
through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating
that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor
scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results
highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from
open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.

Motivation: 基础模型的静态部署与日益增长的社会和监管需求（如GDPR要求的数据遗忘）存在冲突，传统遗忘方法计算成本高且不适合实时系统。

Method: 采用提示学习框架，将信息编码在提示令牌而非模型权重中，通过移除相应提示令牌实现即时遗忘，无需重新训练或访问原始数据。

Result: 实验表明该框架在保留类别上保持预测性能，同时有效擦除遗忘类别，具有强大的隐私和安全保证，能抵抗成员推理攻击。

Conclusion: 通过在架构本身嵌入可移除性，为设计模块化、可扩展和符合伦理的AI模型建立了新基础，适合敏感和受监管环境部署。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed multimedia analysis by enabling robust and
transferable representations across diverse modalities and tasks. However,
their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands
-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by
privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,
including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often
computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or
continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:
rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in
capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies
knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than
encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics
to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by
removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or
access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves
predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten
ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security
guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal
prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.
This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against
unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for
deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding
removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new
foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is crucial for medication
safety and effective drug development. However, existing methods often struggle
to capture structural information across different scales, from local
functional groups to global molecular topology, and typically lack mechanisms
to quantify prediction confidence. To address these limitations, we propose
MPNP-DDI, a novel Multi-scale Graph Neural Process framework. The core of
MPNP-DDI is a unique message-passing scheme that, by being iteratively applied,
learns a hierarchy of graph representations at multiple scales. Crucially, a
cross-drug co-attention mechanism then dynamically fuses these multi-scale
representations to generate context-aware embeddings for interacting drug
pairs, while an integrated neural process module provides principled
uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNP-DDI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets. By
providing accurate, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware predictions built upon
multi-scale structural features, MPNP-DDI represents a powerful computational
tool for pharmacovigilance, polypharmacy risk assessment, and precision
medicine.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant advancements
in fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP),
demonstrating its capability to synthesize high-fidelity data and improve

Motivation: 现有特征选择方法很少专门为EEG诊断设计，大多依赖单一迭代数据，缺乏可解释性，且对EEG信号的低信噪比适应性差，限制了模型性能。

Method: 构建动态记忆库存储历史梯度，通过信息熵计算特征重要性，应用基于熵的加权来选择信息丰富的EEG特征。

Conclusion: IEFS-GMB方法有效提升了EEG分类性能，改善了模型可解释性，支持其在临床环境中的实际应用。

Abstract: Deep learning-based EEG classification is crucial for the automated detection
of neurological disorders, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
intervention. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals limits
model performance, making feature selection (FS) vital for optimizing
representations learned by neural network encoders. Existing FS methods are
seldom designed specifically for EEG diagnosis; many are architecture-dependent
and lack interpretability, limiting their applicability. Moreover, most rely on
single-iteration data, resulting in limited robustness to variability. To
address these issues, we propose IEFS-GMB, an Information Entropy-based Feature
Selection method guided by a Gradient Memory Bank. This approach constructs a
dynamic memory bank storing historical gradients, computes feature importance
via information entropy, and applies entropy-based weighting to select
informative EEG features. Experiments on four public neurological disease
datasets show that encoders enhanced with IEFS-GMB achieve accuracy
improvements of 0.64% to 6.45% over baseline models. The method also
outperforms four competing FS techniques and improves model interpretability,
supporting its practical use in clinical settings.

Abstract: Understanding the real-world effects of recreational drug use remains a
critical challenge in public health and biomedical research, especially as
traditional surveillance systems often underrepresent user experiences. In this
study, we leverage social media (specifically Twitter) as a rich and unfiltered
source of user-reported effects associated with three emerging psychoactive
substances: ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B. By combining a curated list of slang terms
with biomedical concept extraction via MetaMap, we identified and weakly
annotated over 92,000 tweets mentioning these substances. Each tweet was
labeled with a polarity reflecting whether it reported a positive or negative
effect, following an expert-guided heuristic process. We then performed
descriptive and comparative analyses of the reported phenotypic outcomes across
substances and trained multiple machine learning classifiers to predict
polarity from tweet content, accounting for strong class imbalance using
techniques such as cost-sensitive learning and synthetic oversampling. The top
performance on the test set was obtained from eXtreme Gradient Boosting with
cost-sensitive learning (F1 = 0.885, AUPRC = 0.934). Our findings reveal that
Twitter enables the detection of substance-specific phenotypic effects, and
that polarity classification models can support real-time pharmacovigilance and
drug effect characterization with high accuracy.

Abstract: The process by which Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire complex
capabilities during training remains a key open question in mechanistic
interpretability. This project investigates whether these learning dynamics can
be characterized through the lens of Complex Network Theory (CNT). I introduce
a novel methodology to represent a Transformer-based LLM as a directed,
weighted graph where nodes are the model's computational components (attention
heads and MLPs) and edges represent causal influence, measured via an
intervention-based ablation technique. By tracking the evolution of this
component-graph across 143 training checkpoints of the Pythia-14M model on a
canonical induction task, I analyze a suite of graph-theoretic metrics. The
results reveal that the network's structure evolves through distinct phases of
exploration, consolidation, and refinement. Specifically, I identify the
emergence of a stable hierarchy of information spreader components and a
dynamic set of information gatherer components, whose roles reconfigure at key
learning junctures. This work demonstrates that a component-level network
perspective offers a powerful macroscopic lens for visualizing and
understanding the self-organizing principles that drive the formation of
functional circuits in LLMs.

Abstract: The team formation and routing problem is a challenging optimization problem
with several real-world applications in fields such as airport, healthcare, and
maintenance operations. To solve this problem, exact solution methods based on
column generation have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we
propose a novel partial column generation strategy for settings with multiple

with a negative reduced cost. We develop a machine learning model tailored to
the team formation and routing problem that leverages graph neural networks for
these predictions. Computational experiments demonstrate that applying our
strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在医学应用中需要准确答案和透明推理过程的挑战，实现专家级临床推理能力。

Method: 1) 推理导向数据策略(RODS)：结合医学QA数据集和知识图谱引导的合成；2) 思维链冷启动：从教师模型提取高质量推理轨迹；3) 可验证奖励强化学习(RLVR)框架：使用组相对策略优化进行两阶段训练。

Abstract: While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving
expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both
accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical
reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our
Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets
with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented
diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning
trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third,
we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core
reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive
hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers
substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much
larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and
consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results
demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and
verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple
accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent,
reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment
in high-stakes clinical environments.

Motivation: 标准各向同性扩散模型难以有效建模具有相干角度方向模式的图像，受生物系统中相位同步现象的启发，利用Kuramoto动力学作为结构化生成的归纳偏置

Method: 在扩散过程中使用随机Kuramoto动力学，前向过程通过全局或局部耦合振荡器相互作用实现相位同步，反向过程通过学习的分数函数进行去同步生成

Result: 在通用图像基准上取得竞争性结果，在指纹和纹理等方向密集数据集上显著提升生成质量

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生物启发的同步动力学作为生成模型中结构化先验的潜力

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired
synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临的主要挑战是灾难性遗忘。虽然对比损失在构建可迁移和抗遗忘表示方面显示出潜力，但现有方法仍受任务间和任务内特征混淆的限制。

Method: GPLASC方法将表示空间划分为不重叠区域，使用等角紧框架作为任务间预固定中心，同时在各自区域内形成任务内可调整的ETF结构。

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够同时确保任务间和任务内的判别性特征结构。

Conclusion: GPLASC是一种简单有效的对比策略，可以无缝集成到现有的对比持续学习框架中，有效缓解特征混淆问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from
evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging
contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful
representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,
their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both
inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple
yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing,
\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the
entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with
the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular
\textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our
method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs
within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method
\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between
tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing
contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分拆共形预测仅提供期望上的边际覆盖保证，但单个校准集的实现覆盖可能存在显著方差，这在实际应用中削弱了有效的风险控制。

Method: 引入小样本Beta校正（SSBC），通过调整共形显著性水平，利用共形覆盖的精确有限样本分布来提供概率保证。

Result: SSBC方法能够确保在用户定义的概率下，部署的预测器达到至少所需的覆盖水平，解决了传统方法中覆盖方差过大的问题。

Conclusion: SSBC为共形预测提供了更可靠的风险控制机制，通过概率保证增强了实际应用中的预测可靠性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with
guaranteed marginal coverage. However, in split conformal prediction this
guarantee is training-conditional only in expectation: across many calibration
draws, the average coverage equals the nominal level, but the realized coverage
for a single calibration set may vary substantially. This variance undermines
effective risk control in practical applications. Here we introduce the Small
Sample Beta Correction (SSBC), a plug-and-play adjustment to the conformal
significance level that leverages the exact finite-sample distribution of
conformal coverage to provide probabilistic guarantees, ensuring that with
user-defined probability over the calibration draw, the deployed predictor
achieves at least the desired coverage.

Abstract: Recent work has investigated the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
as zero-shot models for generating individual-level characteristics (e.g., to
serve as risk models or augment survey datasets). However, when should a user
have confidence that an LLM will provide high-quality predictions for their
particular task? To address this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study of LLMs' zero-shot predictive capabilities across a wide range of tabular
prediction tasks. We find that LLMs' performance is highly variable, both on
tasks within the same dataset and across different datasets. However, when the
LLM performs well on the base prediction task, its predicted probabilities
become a stronger signal for individual-level accuracy. Then, we construct
metrics to predict LLMs' performance at the task level, aiming to distinguish
between tasks where LLMs may perform well and where they are likely unsuitable.
We find that some of these metrics, each of which are assessed without labeled
data, yield strong signals of LLMs' predictive performance on new tasks.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative
algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to
solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering
data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in
critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial
robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid
theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the
presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we
study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with
$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.
Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized
unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial
Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial
generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with
respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further
present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating
our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the
family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial
robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

Motivation: 现有方法存在独立性假设限制、样本效率低和缺乏有限时间收敛保证等问题，需要开发更高效的Stackelberg MFG算法。

Method: 提出AC-SMFG单循环actor-critic算法，交替更新领导者策略、代表性跟随者和平均场，基于连续生成的马尔可夫样本进行半梯度更新。

Result: 算法在多种经济学环境中优于现有方法，在策略质量和收敛速度方面表现优异，并首次实现了非渐近收敛保证。

Conclusion: AC-SMFG是首个具有非渐近收敛保证的Stackelberg MFG算法，通过梯度对齐条件放宽了独立性假设，为分层多智能体学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study policy optimization in Stackelberg mean field games (MFGs), a
hierarchical framework for modeling the strategic interaction between a single
leader and an infinitely large population of homogeneous followers. The
objective can be formulated as a structured bi-level optimization problem, in
which the leader needs to learn a policy maximizing its reward, anticipating
the response of the followers. Existing methods for solving these (and related)
problems often rely on restrictive independence assumptions between the
leader's and followers' objectives, use samples inefficiently due to
nested-loop algorithm structure, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees.
To address these limitations, we propose AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic
algorithm that operates on continuously generated Markovian samples. The
algorithm alternates between (semi-)gradient updates for the leader, a
representative follower, and the mean field, and is simple to implement in
practice. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the
algorithm to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective. To our knowledge,
this is the first Stackelberg MFG algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees. Our key assumption is a "gradient alignment" condition, which
requires that the full policy gradient of the leader can be approximated by a
partial component of it, relaxing the existing leader-follower independence
assumption. Simulation results in a range of well-established economics
environments demonstrate that AC-SMFG outperforms existing multi-agent and MFG
learning baselines in policy quality and convergence speed.

Conclusion: VMDNet解决了VMD方法的信息泄漏和超参数选择问题，为周期性时间序列预测提供了有效的因果分解框架。

Abstract: In time series forecasting, capturing recurrent temporal patterns is
essential; decomposition techniques make such structure explicit and thereby
improve predictive performance. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a
powerful signal-processing method for periodicity-aware decomposition and has
seen growing adoption in recent years. However, existing studies often suffer
from information leakage and rely on inappropriate hyperparameter tuning. To
address these issues, we propose VMDNet, a causality-preserving framework that
(i) applies sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; (ii) represents each decomposed
mode with frequency-aware embeddings and decodes it using parallel temporal
convolutional networks (TCNs), ensuring mode independence and efficient
learning; and (iii) introduces a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimisation to
adaptively select VMD's two core hyperparameters: the number of modes (K) and
the bandwidth penalty (alpha). Experiments on two energy-related datasets
demonstrate that VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is
strong, showing clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns
while remaining robust under weak periodicity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hierarchical optimization refers to problems with interdependent decision
variables and objectives, such as minimax and bilevel formulations. While
various algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack
adaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal
convergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior
knowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive
algorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization
problems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and
nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp
convergence rates of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$
in $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\bar{\sigma}$ is an upper bound
on the stochastic gradient noise. Notably, these rates are obtained without
prior knowledge of the noise level, thereby enabling automatic adaptivity in
both low and high-noise regimes. To our knowledge, this work provides the first
adaptive and sharp convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical
optimization. Our algorithm design combines the momentum normalization
technique with novel adaptive parameter choices. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithms.

Conclusion: DA-IBC方法有效解决了多模态驾驶决策学习问题，通过数据增强和改进推理策略显著提升了隐式行为克隆的性能，在复杂驾驶场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Standard Behavior Cloning (BC) fails to learn multimodal driving decisions,
where multiple valid actions exist for the same scenario. We explore Implicit
Behavioral Cloning (IBC) with Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to better capture this
multimodality. We propose Data-Augmented IBC (DA-IBC), which improves learning
by perturbing expert actions to form the counterexamples of IBC training and
using better initialization for derivative-free inference. Experiments in the
CARLA simulator with Bird's-Eye View inputs demonstrate that DA-IBC outperforms
standard IBC in urban driving tasks designed to evaluate multimodal behavior
learning in a test environment. The learned energy landscapes are able to
represent multimodal action distributions, which BC fails to achieve.

Conclusion: RAMPART框架在特征排名任务中表现出色，特别是在高维基因组学应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate ranking of important features is a fundamental challenge in
interpretable machine learning with critical applications in scientific
discovery and decision-making. Unlike feature selection and feature importance,
the specific problem of ranking important features has received considerably
less attention. We introduce RAMPART (Ranked Attributions with MiniPatches And
Recursive Trimming), a framework that utilizes any existing feature importance
measure in a novel algorithm specifically tailored for ranking the top-$k$
features. Our approach combines an adaptive sequential halving strategy that
progressively focuses computational resources on promising features with an
efficient ensembling technique using both observation and feature subsampling.
Unlike existing methods that convert importance scores to ranks as
post-processing, our framework explicitly optimizes for ranking accuracy. We
provide theoretical guarantees showing that RAMPART achieves the correct
top-$k$ ranking with high probability under mild conditions, and demonstrate
through extensive simulation studies that RAMPART consistently outperforms
popular feature importance methods, concluding with a high-dimensional genomics
case study.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells
but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR
amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency,
making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous
datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on
principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its
interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix
Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal
components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel
biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that
simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use
of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering
sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains
the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of
sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and
four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves
the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-,
autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Abstract: Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the
field of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data,
they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities
with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the
attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales
from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to
incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based
on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar
problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in
this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a
mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then
mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct
from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived
formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard
Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the
hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an
efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived
attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the
proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train
transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it
can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained
transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in
zero-shot manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的交互感知混合精度量化方法(IMPQ)，通过将混合精度量化问题建模为层间合作博弈，在2-4位精度范围内显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合精度量化方法在平均精度低于4位时性能下降，因为它们依赖于孤立的层级指标而忽略了关键的层间交互影响。

Method: 提出SPQE方法高效计算层敏感度的Shapley估计，然后基于此提出IMPQ方法，将Shapley估计转化为二进制二次优化问题，在严格内存约束下为各层分配2或4位精度。

Result: 在Llama-3、Gemma-2和Qwen-3模型上的实验表明，在4位到2位精度范围内，IMPQ相比最佳基线方法将困惑度降低了20%到80%，且随着位宽收紧优势更加明显。

Conclusion: IMPQ方法通过考虑层间交互效应，在低精度量化场景下实现了显著性能提升，展示了其在资源受限部署中的实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise impressive capabilities, yet their
multi-billion-parameter scale makes on-device or low-resource deployment
prohibitive. Mixed-precision quantization offers a compelling solution, but
existing methods struggle when the average precision drops below four bits, as
they rely on isolated, layer-specific metrics that overlook critical
inter-layer interactions affecting overall performance. In this paper, we
propose two innovations to address these limitations. First, we frame the
mixed-precision quantization problem as a cooperative game among layers and
introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to
efficiently obtain accurate Shapley estimates of layer sensitivities and
inter-layer interactions. Second, building upon SPQE, we propose
Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these
Shapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning
either 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models
across three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's
scalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying
solely on isolated metrics. Across average precisions spanning 4 bit down to 2
bit, IMPQ cuts Perplexity by 20 to 80 percent relative to the best baseline,
with the margin growing as the bit-width tightens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多假设知识图谱是静态快照，忽略了现实世界数据的时序动态性和事实不一致性，导致LLMs难以处理随时间变化的知识

Method: EvoReasoner进行全局-局部实体对齐、多路径分解和时间基础评分；EvoKG通过置信度矛盾解决和时间趋势跟踪从非结构化文档增量更新知识图谱

Result: 在时序QA基准测试和端到端动态更新设置中优于基于提示和KG增强的基线方法，8B参数模型性能可匹敌671B模型

Conclusion: 结合时间推理和知识图谱演化对于实现鲁棒和最新的LLM性能至关重要

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many language understanding tasks but
struggle to reason over knowledge that evolves. To address this, recent work
has explored augmenting LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide structured,
up-to-date information. However, many existing approaches assume a static
snapshot of the KG and overlook the temporal dynamics and factual
inconsistencies inherent in real-world data. To address the challenge of
reasoning over temporally shifting knowledge, we propose EvoReasoner, a
temporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm that performs global-local entity
grounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. To
ensure that the underlying KG remains accurate and up-to-date, we introduce
EvoKG, a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG
from unstructured documents through confidence-based contradiction resolution
and temporal trend tracking. We evaluate our approach on temporal QA benchmarks
and a novel end-to-end setting where the KG is dynamically updated from raw
documents. Our method outperforms both prompting-based and KG-enhanced
baselines, effectively narrowing the gap between small and large LLMs on
dynamic question answering. Notably, an 8B-parameter model using our approach
matches the performance of a 671B model prompted seven months later. These
results highlight the importance of combining temporal reasoning with KG
evolution for robust and up-to-date LLM performance. Our code is publicly
available at github.com/junhongmit/TREK.

Abstract: Accurate solar forecasting underpins effective renewable energy management.
We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global
horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from
site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or
satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To
deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three
classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural
components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station
identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors
(e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural
network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across
stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It
outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse
geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top
commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and
generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于标签的分类器只能检测已知类型的欺诈，但无法发现新型欺诈行为。需要同时实现欺诈检测和证据提供两个目标。

Method: 使用微聚类方法在精心设计的特征空间中识别新型欺诈模式，并通过可视化、热图和交互式仪表板提供证据支持。

Result: 在真实百万级金融数据集上发现了三种新的欺诈行为，其中两种被领域专家确认为欺诈或可疑，捕获了数百个原本会被忽略的欺诈交易。

Conclusion: FRAUDGUESS在真实金融环境中有效，目前正在匿名金融机构中考虑部署，证明了其在发现新型欺诈行为方面的实用价值。

Abstract: Given a set of financial transactions (who buys from whom, when, and for how
much), as well as prior information from buyers and sellers, how can we find
fraudulent transactions? If we have labels for some transactions for known
types of fraud, we can build a classifier. However, we also want to find new
types of fraud, still unknown to the domain experts ('Detection'). Moreover, we
also want to provide evidence to experts that supports our opinion
('Justification'). In this paper, we propose FRAUDGUESS, to achieve two goals:
(a) for 'Detection', it spots new types of fraud as micro-clusters in a
carefully designed feature space; (b) for 'Justification', it uses
visualization and heatmaps for evidence, as well as an interactive dashboard
for deep dives. FRAUDGUESS is used in real life and is currently considered for
deployment in an Anonymous Financial Institution (AFI). Thus, we also present
the three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale
financial dataset. Two of these behaviors are deemed fraudulent or suspicious
by domain experts, catching hundreds of fraudulent transactions that would
otherwise go un-noticed.

Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法在紧凑网络尺寸下难以准确表示科学数据中的多尺度结构、高频信息和精细纹理，限制了其在科学数据编码中的应用。

Method: 提出WIEN-INR方法，采用小波信息引导的多尺度架构，在不同分辨率尺度上分布建模，并在最精细尺度使用专门的核网络来恢复细微细节。

Conclusion: WIEN-INR为高保真科学数据编码提供了一个实用的神经表示框架，扩展了INR在需要高效保存精细细节领域的应用范围。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a compact and
parametric alternative to discrete array-based data representations, encoding
information directly in neural network weights to enable resolution-independent
representation and memory efficiency. However, existing INR approaches, when
constrained to compact network sizes, struggle to faithfully represent the
multi-scale structures, high-frequency information, and fine textures that
characterize the majority of scientific datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose WIEN-INR, a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation that
distributes modeling across different resolution scales and employs a
specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details. This
multi-scale architecture allows for the use of smaller networks to retain the
full spectrum of information while preserving the training efficiency and
reducing storage cost. Through extensive experiments on diverse scientific
datasets spanning different scales and structural complexities, WIEN-INR
achieves superior reconstruction fidelity while maintaining a compact model
size. These results demonstrate WIEN-INR as a practical neural representation
framework for high-fidelity scientific data encoding, extending the
applicability of INRs to domains where efficient preservation of fine detail is
essential.

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，EWA-VQ-ODT相比ODT提高了样本效率和平均回报，特别是在早期训练阶段

Conclusion: 该方法计算效率高、可解释性强，并有理论保证，为决策变换器提供了有效的记忆增强机制

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential
decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement
learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value
function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL
as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and
lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation
through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable
alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on
bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use
standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes.
This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness.
Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we
propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online
Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains
per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures.
Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact
vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated
online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate
attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no
change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control
benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT,
particularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient,
interpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that
bound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对具有一般损失函数和未知参数的马尔可夫决策过程的贝叶斯风险敏感策略梯度优化方法，解决了传统动态规划方法不适用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用问题涉及具有一般损失函数和未知参数的MDP，由于参数不确定性导致的风险需要通过贝叶斯方法进行估计，但传统基于动态规划的方法无法处理这种不满足可交换性原则的公式。

Method: 利用相干风险测度的对偶表示，将包络定理扩展到连续情况，提出策略梯度优化方法，并进一步扩展到情景设置。

Result: 算法具有O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})的收敛速率，其中T是策略梯度迭代次数，r是梯度估计器的样本大小。在情景设置下，算法具有全局收敛性，达到O(ε)误差界所需的迭代次数有界。

Conclusion: 提出的策略梯度方法有效解决了贝叶斯风险敏感MDP的优化问题，为处理参数不确定性和风险敏感决策提供了可行的计算框架。

Abstract: Motivated by many application problems, we consider Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with a general loss function and unknown parameters. To mitigate the
epistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian
approach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk
functional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss.
Since this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability
principle, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by
approaches based on dynamic programming. Therefore, We propose a policy
gradient optimization method, leveraging the dual representation of coherent
risk measures and extending the envelope theorem to continuous cases. We then
show the stationary analysis of the algorithm with a convergence rate of
$O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of policy gradient iterations
and $r$ is the sample size of the gradient estimator. We further extend our
algorithm to an episodic setting, and establish the global convergence of the
extended algorithm and provide bounds on the number of iterations needed to
achieve an error bound $O(\epsilon)$ in each episode.

Conclusion: KoopCast在保持高预测精度的同时，继承了线性算子的优良特性，能够忠实捕捉非线性动力学，具有模式级可解释性和实际效率。

Abstract: We present KoopCast, a lightweight yet efficient model for trajectory
forecasting in general dynamic environments. Our approach leverages Koopman
operator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by
lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a
two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts
plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman
operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a
nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go.
This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also
inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully
capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key
advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman
spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits
on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich
multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across
benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together
with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional data often lie on or
near a low-dimensional manifold. Estimating the dimension of this manifold is
essential for leveraging its structure, yet existing work on dimension
estimation is fragmented and lacks systematic evaluation. This article provides
a comprehensive survey for both researchers and practitioners. We review
often-overlooked theoretical foundations and present eight representative
estimators. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how individual factors
such as noise, curvature, and sample size affect performance. We also compare
the estimators on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, introducing a
principled approach to dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. Our results
offer practical guidance and suggest that, for a problem of this generality,
simpler methods often perform better.

Conclusion: DAC方法通过动态感知上下文建模有效解决了完全去中心化多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战

Abstract: This paper studies fully decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
learning, where each agent solely observes the states, its local actions, and
the shared rewards. The inability to access other agents' actions often leads
to non-stationarity during value function updates and relative
overgeneralization during value function estimation, hindering effective
cooperative policy learning. However, existing works fail to address both
issues simultaneously, due to their inability to model the joint policy of
other agents in a fully decentralized setting. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the
task, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision
Process, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative
overgeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC
attributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches
between unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.
Then, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and
refers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based
value function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function
update. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived
to promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the
relative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various
cooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its
superior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本文为同时满足通用近似和解析可处理性的模型类建立了理论基础，为解决非线性随机系统的信念传播问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Predicting the distribution of future states in a stochastic system, known as
belief propagation, is fundamental to reasoning under uncertainty. However,
nonlinear dynamics often make analytical belief propagation intractable,
requiring approximate methods. When the system model is unknown and must be
learned from data, a key question arises: can we learn a model that (i)
universally approximates general nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii)
supports analytical belief propagation? This paper establishes the theoretical
foundations for a class of models that satisfy both properties. The proposed
approach combines the expressiveness of normalizing flows for density
estimation with the analytical tractability of Bernstein polynomials. Empirical
results show the efficacy of our learned model over state-of-the-art
data-driven methods for belief propagation, especially for highly non-linear
systems with non-additive, non-Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Existing decentralized stochastic optimization methods assume the lower-level
loss function is strongly convex and the stochastic gradient noise has finite
variance. These strong assumptions typically are not satisfied in real-world
machine learning models. To address these limitations, we develop a novel
decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization algorithm for the nonconvex
bilevel optimization problem under heavy-tailed noises. Specifically, we
develop a normalized stochastic variance-reduced bilevel gradient descent
algorithm, which does not rely on any clipping operation. Moreover, we
establish its convergence rate by innovatively bounding interdependent gradient
sequences under heavy-tailed noises for nonconvex decentralized bilevel
optimization problems. As far as we know, this is the first decentralized
bilevel optimization algorithm with rigorous theoretical guarantees under
heavy-tailed noises. The extensive experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm in handling heavy-tailed noises.

TL;DR: PolyJuice是一种黑盒、图像无关的红队方法，用于对抗合成图像检测器（SIDs），通过识别T2I潜在空间中的分布偏移方向，并利用该方向普遍引导所有生成图像朝向SID的失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的红队解决方案需要白盒访问SIDs，这对于专有的最先进检测器不可行，并且通过昂贵的在线优化生成图像特定攻击。PolyJuice旨在解决这些限制。

Method: PolyJuice通过轻量级离线过程识别SID正确和错误分类样本之间的T2I潜在空间分布偏移方向，并利用该方向普遍引导所有生成图像。该方法可以在较低分辨率下高效估计转向方向，并通过简单插值转移到更高分辨率。

Result: PolyJuice引导的T2I模型在欺骗SIDs方面比未引导的对应模型显著更有效（高达84%）。在PolyJuice增强数据集上调整SID模型显著提高了检测器的性能（高达30%）。

Conclusion: PolyJuice是第一个黑盒、图像无关的SID红队方法，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，同时还能通过数据增强提升检测器性能。

Abstract: Synthetic image detectors (SIDs) are a key defense against the risks posed by
the growing realism of images from text-to-image (T2I) models. Red teaming
improves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes
via misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i)
require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary
state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through
expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs,
based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples
correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by
(i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline
process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting
this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's
failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at
deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also
show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower
resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation,
reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on
PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors
(up to 30%).

### [189] [The Multi-Query Paradox in Zeroth-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15552)
*Wei Lin,Qingyu Song,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统解决了零阶优化中的查询分配问题，发现查询效率取决于聚合方法：简单平均法(ZO-Avg)单次查询最优，而投影对齐法(ZO-Align)多查询更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零阶优化中多查询方法能提高梯度估计精度，但查询预算固定时，每次迭代查询次数与总迭代次数成反比，如何最优分配查询预算是一个尚未充分探索的关键问题。

Method: 分析两种聚合方法：常用的简单平均法(ZO-Avg)和新提出的投影对齐法(ZO-Align)，通过推导收敛速率明确查询次数的影响，涵盖强凸、凸、非凸和随机优化场景。

Result: 发现明显二分现象：ZO-Avg使用多于一次查询总是查询效率低下，单查询方法最优；而ZO-Align通常多查询表现更好，全子空间估计是最优方法。

Conclusion: 多查询问题本质上是两种经典算法的选择，完全由所用聚合方法决定，这一理论发现在大量实验中得到了验证。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a powerful framework for problems
where explicit gradients are unavailable and have to be approximated using only
queries to function value. The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but
suffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to
improves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:
under a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the
total number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one
another. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored
question.
  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze
two aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new
Projection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate
minimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the
dependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,
non-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,
we prove that using more than one query per iteration is always
query-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the
contrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,
resulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work
clarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an
intermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated
entirely by the aggregation method used. These theoretical findings are also
consistently validated by extensive experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的RLVR方法，通过引入复合奖励函数来减少医疗问答领域中的奖励攻击行为，特别是针对无推理直接给出答案和非标准推理格式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗问答领域应用RLVR时，模型在推理阶段容易出现严重的奖励攻击行为，包括不提供推理直接给出答案和使用非标准推理格式来利用奖励机制。

Method: 引入复合奖励函数，对两种主要的奖励攻击行为施加特定惩罚：1）无前置推理直接给出最终答案；2）使用非标准推理格式来利用奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，扩展RLVR并使用提出的奖励模型能够产生格式更好的推理，减少奖励攻击，同时保持与基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法朝着减少奖励攻击和增强使用RLVR的模型可靠性迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently shown that
large language models (LLMs) can develop their own reasoning without direct
supervision. However, applications in the medical domain, specifically for
question answering, are susceptible to significant reward hacking during the
reasoning phase. Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i)
providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing
non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate
these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for
these behaviors. Our experiments show that extending RLVR with our proposed
reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and
good accuracy compared to the baselines. This approach marks a step toward
reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of models utilizing RLVR.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于小型LLM的超参数调优专家块框架，通过轨迹上下文总结器将训练轨迹转化为结构化上下文，使小型LLM在10次试验预算下能达到接近GPT-4的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型超参数调优计算成本高且不透明，现有LLM方法依赖百亿参数以上模型，需要开发更高效的小型LLM解决方案

Method: 专家块框架核心是轨迹上下文总结器(TCS)，将原始训练轨迹转化为结构化上下文，使用phi4:reasoning14B和qwen2.5-coder:32B两个本地运行的小型LLM

Result: 在10次试验预算下，TCS增强的HPT管道在六个不同任务中平均性能仅比GPT-4低约0.9个百分点

Conclusion: 该方法证明小型LLM通过适当的上下文结构化，能够以较低计算成本实现接近大型模型的超参数调优性能

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML)
pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most
rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block
Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context
Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training
trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze
optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two
locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial
budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9
percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据包含复杂且纠缠的变化因素，使得系统研究类别发现变得困难。许多关于新类别发现成功条件的基本问题尚未得到解答。

Method: 使用dSprites数据集构建受控实验框架，通过程序生成修改因子，研究已知/未知类别数量与发现性能的关系，以及已知类别覆盖度对新类别发现的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，已知类别数量的益处存在饱和点，超过该点后发现性能趋于平稳。不同设置下的收益递减模式为实践者提供了成本效益分析的见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为新类别发现提供了系统研究方法，为在复杂现实世界数据集上进行更严格的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Novel class discovery is essential for ML models to adapt to evolving
real-world data, with applications ranging from scientific discovery to
robotics. However, these datasets contain complex and entangled factors of
variation, making a systematic study of class discovery difficult. As a result,
many fundamental questions are yet to be answered on why and when new class
discoveries are more likely to be successful. To address this, we propose a
simple controlled experimental framework using the dSprites dataset with
procedurally generated modifying factors. This allows us to investigate what
influences successful class discovery. In particular, we study the relationship
between the number of known/unknown classes and discovery performance, as well
as the impact of known class 'coverage' on discovering new classes. Our
empirical results indicate that the benefit of the number of known classes
reaches a saturation point beyond which discovery performance plateaus. The
pattern of diminishing return across different settings provides an insight for
cost-benefit analysis for practitioners and a starting point for more rigorous
future research of class discovery on complex real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Latent Zoning Network (LZN)，通过创建共享高斯潜在空间来统一解决生成建模、表示学习和分类三个核心机器学习任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习中生成建模、表示学习和分类的最先进解决方案相互独立，缺乏统一原则。本文旨在探索能否用一个统一框架同时解决这三个任务，以简化机器学习流程并促进任务间的协同效应。

Method: LZN为每种数据类型（如图像、文本、标签）配备编码器和解码器，将样本映射到潜在空间的不同区域。机器学习任务被表达为这些编码器和解码器的组合，例如标签条件图像生成使用标签编码器和图像解码器。

Result: 在三个场景中验证LZN：1）与Rectified Flow模型结合，CIFAR10上的FID从2.76提升到2.59；2）在无监督表示学习中，下游线性分类性能优于MoCo和SimCLR；3）在联合生成和分类任务中，同时实现SoTA分类精度和改善的FID。

Conclusion: LZN展示了用一个统一框架解决多个机器学习核心任务的可行性，为简化机器学习流程和促进任务间协同提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three
core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)
solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified
principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and
foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)
as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent
space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,
text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent
zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as
compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional
image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses
an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We
demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN
can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA
Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without
modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently
(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation
learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and
SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear
classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously
(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,
LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA
classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据需要复杂模型才能获得竞争力，但牺牲了可解释性。在医疗等高风险应用中，需要既准确又可解释的预测方法。

Method: 使用个性化预测方案，为每个查询学习稀疏线性分类器；结合参考类学习算法和稀疏线性表示列表学习器；在标签无关设置下研究半空间子群体的PAC可学习性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持可解释性的同时实现竞争性性能，为高风险应用中的机器学习部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In machine learning applications, predictive models are trained to serve
future queries across the entire data distribution. Real-world data often
demands excessively complex models to achieve competitive performance, however,
sacrificing interpretability. Hence, the growing deployment of machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, motivates the search
for methods for accurate and explainable predictions. This work proposes a
Personalized Prediction scheme, where an easy-to-interpret predictor is learned
per query. In particular, we wish to produce a "sparse linear" classifier with
competitive performance specifically on some sub-population that includes the
query point. The goal of this work is to study the PAC-learnability of this
prediction model for sub-populations represented by "halfspaces" in a
label-agnostic setting. We first give a distribution-specific PAC-learning
algorithm for learning reference classes for personalized prediction. By
leveraging both the reference-class learning algorithm and a list learner of
sparse linear representations, we prove the first upper bound,
$O(\mathrm{opt}^{1/4} )$, for personalized prediction with sparse linear
classifiers and homogeneous halfspace subsets. We also evaluate our algorithms
on a variety of standard benchmark data sets.

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了自动摘要在改进在线新闻平台内容管理系统方面的潜力，能够实现更高效的内容组织和更好的用户体验。

Abstract: In the age of information overload, content management for online news
articles relies on efficient summarization to enhance accessibility and user
engagement. This article addresses the challenge of extractive text
summarization by employing advanced machine learning techniques to generate
concise and coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning. Using the
Cornell Newsroom dataset, comprising 1.3 million article-summary pairs, we
developed a pipeline leveraging BERT embeddings to transform textual data into
numerical representations. By framing the task as a binary classification
problem, we explored various models, including logistic regression,
feed-forward neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our
findings demonstrate that LSTM networks, with their ability to capture
sequential dependencies, outperform baseline methods like Lede-3 and simpler
models in F1 score and ROUGE-1 metrics. This study underscores the potential of
automated summarization in improving content management systems for online news
platforms, enabling more efficient content organization and enhanced user
experiences.

Result: 展示了三个主要结果：（i）贝叶斯规则简化为自然梯度的加法；（ii）梯度方法中二次代理函数的推广；（iii）针对大语言模型的大规模变分贝叶斯算法实现。

Conclusion: 信息几何与变分贝叶斯之间的基本联系及其后果并非全新发现，但本文进一步强调了两者的共同起源，旨在促进交叉领域的研究发展。

Abstract: We highlight a fundamental connection between information geometry and
variational Bayes (VB) and discuss its consequences for machine learning. Under
certain conditions, a VB solution always requires estimation or computation of
natural gradients. We show several consequences of this fact by using the
natural-gradient descent algorithm of Khan and Rue (2023) called the Bayesian
Learning Rule (BLR). These include (i) a simplification of Bayes' rule as
addition of natural gradients, (ii) a generalization of quadratic surrogates
used in gradient-based methods, and (iii) a large-scale implementation of VB
algorithms for large language models. Neither the connection nor its
consequences are new but we further emphasize the common origins of the two
fields of information geometry and Bayes with a hope to facilitate more work at
the intersection of the two fields.

TL;DR: SPReD是一个强化学习框架，通过集成方法建模Q值分布，使用不确定性感知方法来决定何时模仿演示数据而非遵循自身策略，实现连续的、与不确定性成比例的正则化权重，在稀疏奖励任务中显著提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 在稀疏奖励的强化学习中，演示数据可以加速学习，但确定何时模仿演示数据仍然具有挑战性。现有方法（如Q-filter）通常做出二值化的模仿决策，缺乏对不确定性的考虑。

Method: SPReD使用集成方法显式建模演示和策略动作的Q值分布，开发了两种互补的不确定性感知方法：概率方法估计演示优越性的可能性，以及基于优势的方法按统计显著性缩放模仿强度。

Result: 在八个机器人任务上的实验表明，SPReD取得了显著提升，在复杂任务中性能优于现有方法高达14倍，同时对演示质量和数量保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SPReD通过不确定性感知的连续正则化方法，有效解决了何时模仿演示数据的问题，在稀疏奖励强化学习中实现了卓越的性能提升。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate
learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose
Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that
addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a
demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to
explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy
actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary
uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood
of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation
by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that
make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,
uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance
during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves
remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming
existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining
robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为在大规模模型上应用影响函数提供了可行的解决方案，增强了模型行为的可解释性。

Abstract: Assessing the impact the training data on machine learning models is crucial
for understanding the behavior of the model, enhancing the transparency, and
selecting training data. Influence function provides a theoretical framework
for quantifying the effect of training data points on model's performance given
a specific test data. However, the computational and memory costs of influence
function presents significant challenges, especially for large-scale models,
even when using approximation methods, since the gradients involved in
computation are as large as the model itself. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that leverages dropout as a gradient compression mechanism to
compute the influence function more efficiently. Our method significantly
reduces computational and memory overhead, not only during the influence
function computation but also in gradient compression process. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that our method
could preserves critical components of the data influence and enables its
application to modern large-scale models.

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient batch algorithm for feature selection in
reinforcement learning (RL) with theoretical convergence guarantees. To
mitigate the estimation bias inherent in conventional regularization schemes,
the first contribution extends policy evaluation within the classical
least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) framework by formulating a
Bellman-residual objective regularized with the sparsity-inducing, nonconvex
projected minimax concave (PMC) penalty. Owing to the weak convexity of the PMC
penalty, this formulation can be interpreted as a special instance of a general
nonmonotone-inclusion problem. The second contribution establishes novel
convergence conditions for the forward-reflected-backward splitting (FRBS)
algorithm to solve this class of problems. Numerical experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, particularly in scenarios with many
noisy features.

Conclusion: H2T2是一种模型无关、无需训练的策略，能够在推理阶段通过有限反馈进行学习，有效解决了边缘智能系统中的分层推理优化问题。

Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system
where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a
compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote
model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For
each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference.
Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the
remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between
classification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical
inference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning
framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's
confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model
and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We
present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is
calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce
H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it
achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and
learns in the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world
datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI
policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also
demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to
mismatched classifiers.

Conclusion: 通过信息理论驱动的原则性方法，本文提出的示例选择策略能够有效提升上下文学习的性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to new and data-scarce tasks using only a few
carefully selected task-specific examples presented in the prompt. However,
given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which
examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?
While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for
this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional
embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In
this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,
information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear
function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a
query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a
larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.
This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning
theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query
instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately
submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation
guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick
to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and
(ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in
the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements
over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks,
highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RMT-KD是一种基于随机矩阵理论的知识蒸馏压缩方法，通过保留隐藏表示中的信息方向来迭代减小网络规模，实现80%参数减少且仅损失2%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型深度学习模型（如BERT和ResNet）在边缘设备部署时因模型大小和计算需求过高而成本昂贵的问题

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论进行知识蒸馏，通过分析隐藏表示的谱特性识别并保留信息方向，逐层应用基于RMT的因果缩减并结合自蒸馏来保持稳定性和准确性

Result: 在GLUE、AG News和CIFAR-10数据集上实现80%参数减少，仅损失2%准确率，推理速度提升2.8倍，功耗降低近一半

Conclusion: RMT-KD为网络蒸馏提供了一种数学基础扎实的方法，在保持性能的同时显著提升了模型效率

Abstract: Large deep learning models such as BERT and ResNet achieve state-of-the-art
performance but are costly to deploy at the edge due to their size and compute
demands. We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size.
Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only
informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden
representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with
self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and
CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy
loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption.
These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network
distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EigenTrack是一种可解释的实时检测器，利用隐藏激活的谱几何来检测LLM的幻觉和分布外错误，通过流式协方差谱统计和轻量级递归分类器跟踪表示结构的时间变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生幻觉和分布外错误，需要一种能够实时检测这些错误的方法，同时保持可解释性和效率。

Method: 使用隐藏激活的谱几何作为模型动态的全局签名，通过流式协方差谱统计（如熵、特征值间隙、KL散度）输入轻量级递归分类器，跟踪表示结构的时间变化。

Result: EigenTrack能够在表面错误出现之前检测到幻觉和分布外漂移，仅需单次前向传播，无需重采样，并保持时间上下文和全局信号聚合。

Conclusion: EigenTrack提供了一种可解释的实时检测方法，优于黑盒和灰盒方法，并在准确性和延迟之间提供可解释的权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to
hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an
interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden
activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming
covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL
divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier,
EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal
hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and
grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling.
Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates
global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Motivation: 标准参数模型经常忽略飞机老化导致的性能下降，这对运营规划和环境影响评估至关重要。

Method: 系统评估了基于物理的经典模型、经验修正系数以及将年龄作为输入特征或显式乘法偏置的数据驱动神经网络架构。

Result: 基线模型持续低估老旧飞机的燃油消耗，而使用年龄相关修正因子和神经网络模型显著减少了偏差并提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在参数和机器学习框架中考虑老化效应的重要性，以提高运营和环境评估的可靠性，同时指出需要更多样化的数据集来捕捉真实世界发动机退化的复杂性。

Abstract: Accurate modelling of aircraft fuel-flow is crucial for both operational
planning and environmental impact assessment, yet standard parametric models
often neglect performance deterioration that occurs as aircraft age. This paper
investigates multiple approaches to integrate engine ageing effects into
fuel-flow prediction for the Airbus A320-214, using a comprehensive dataset of
approximately nineteen thousand Quick Access Recorder flights from nine
distinct airframes with varying years in service. We systematically evaluate
classical physics-based models, empirical correction coefficients, and
data-driven neural network architectures that incorporate age either as an
input feature or as an explicit multiplicative bias. Results demonstrate that
while baseline models consistently underestimate fuel consumption for older
aircraft, the use of age-dependent correction factors and neural models
substantially reduces bias and improves prediction accuracy. Nevertheless,
limitations arise from the small number of airframes and the lack of detailed
maintenance event records, which constrain the representativeness and
generalization of age-based corrections. This study emphasizes the importance
of accounting for the effects of ageing in parametric and machine learning
frameworks to improve the reliability of operational and environmental
assessments. The study also highlights the need for more diverse datasets that
can capture the complexity of real-world engine deterioration.

TL;DR: GUI-ReWalk是一个基于推理增强的多阶段框架，用于合成现实且多样化的GUI轨迹数据，解决了GUI智能体研究中高质量轨迹数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI智能体的发展受到可扩展、高质量轨迹数据稀缺的限制。现有数据收集方法要么依赖昂贵的手动标注，要么在多样性和任务覆盖度之间做出妥协。

Method: GUI-ReWalk采用多阶段框架：首先进行随机探索模拟人类试错行为，然后过渡到推理引导阶段，通过推断目标驱动连贯交互。支持多步任务生成，构建跨应用的长期工作流。

Result: 在多个基准测试（Screenspot-Pro、OSWorld-G等）上评估显示，GUI-ReWalk能够实现更好的交互流覆盖、更高的轨迹熵和更真实的用户意图。

Conclusion: GUI-ReWalk被证明是一个可扩展且数据高效的框架，能够推动GUI智能体研究并实现稳健的现实世界自动化。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, powered by large language and
vision-language models, hold promise for enabling end-to-end automation in
digital environments. However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by
the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data
collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations
or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and
meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a
reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and
diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase
that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions
into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and
purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation,
enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple
applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning
for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware,
adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B
on the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including
Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results
demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction
flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These
findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for
advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.

TL;DR: 本文提出iFSNet（增量快慢学习网络），一种用于电池早期预测的在线机器学习方法，能够适应数据分布变化，实现多步预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型多为离线模式，需要在新数据分布出现时重新训练。需要一种在线方法使模型能够适应变化的分布，但现有在线增量多步预测方法面临无法即时修正预测和需要大量数据才能重新训练的挑战。

Method: iFSNet是FSNet的改进版本，采用单次通过模式（逐样本处理），使用伪目标实现多步预测。通过输入序列的简单线性回归器外推伪未来样本（伪目标），计算其余预测的损失并持续更新模型。

Result: 在具有平滑退化轨迹的数据集上，模型达到0.00197 RMSE和0.00154 MAE；在具有不规则退化轨迹和容量再生尖峰的数据集上，达到0.01588 RMSE和0.01234 MAE。

Conclusion: iFSNet结合了FSNet的联想记忆和自适应结构机制，同时通过使用伪目标实现增量改进，有效解决了电池早期预测中的在线学习挑战。

Abstract: Data-driven models accurately perform early battery prognosis to prevent
equipment failure and further safety hazards. Most existing machine learning
(ML) models work in offline mode which must consider their retraining
post-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there
is a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying
distributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a
great challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the
current instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of
time to acquire enough streaming data before retraining. In this study, we
propose iFSNet (incremental Fast and Slow learning Network) which is a modified
version of FSNet for a single-pass mode (sample-by-sample) to achieve multistep
forecasting using pseudo targets. It uses a simple linear regressor of the
input sequence to extrapolate pseudo future samples (pseudo targets) and
calculate the loss from the rest of the forecast and keep updating the model.
The model benefits from the associative memory and adaptive structure
mechanisms of FSNet, at the same time the model incrementally improves by using
pseudo targets. The proposed model achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on
datasets with smooth degradation trajectories while it achieved 0.01588 RMSE
and 0.01234 MAE on datasets having irregular degradation trajectories with
capacity regeneration spikes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公平机器学习中'偏见输入偏见输出'的根本问题，确保模型输出具有可证明的公平性保证，避免公平性与效用之间的权衡。

Method: 定义理想分布概念，提出基于KL散度的最优引导优化程序，为常见参数分布族（如正态、对数正态）提供高效算法，并在LLM表示上进行仿射引导。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不降低效用（有时甚至提高效用）的情况下改善了公平性，特别是在Bios数据集的职业预测任务中有效减少了偏见。

Conclusion: 提出的最优引导技术能够有效解决公平机器学习中的偏见问题，为LLM等模型提供了实用的公平性保证方法。

Abstract: To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is
important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes.
Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could
greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We
define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on
it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity,
equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We
formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest
ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it
when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families
(e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on
both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing
utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of
LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g.,
occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et
al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired
outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经网络和深度强化学习的半导体制造产能规划模型，通过异构图神经网络捕捉机器与处理步骤之间的复杂关系，实现主动决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半导体制造业通常使用启发式规则进行产能规划，虽然具有可解释性，但难以处理流程中复杂的相互作用，容易导致瓶颈形成。

Method: 使用深度强化学习训练神经网络模型，采用异构图神经网络表示策略，直接捕捉机器和处理步骤之间的多样化关系。

Result: 在Intel的Minifab模型和SMT2020测试平台上进行评估，在最大测试场景中，训练后的策略使吞吐量提高约1.8%，周期时间降低约1.8%。

Conclusion: 基于神经网络的产能规划方法能够有效处理半导体制造中的复杂交互，实现比传统启发式方法更好的性能。

Abstract: In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production
resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in
semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize
actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and
recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot
easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can
gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural
network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines,
trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a
heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse
relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive
decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient
scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions.
  Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and
preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest
tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle
time by about 1.8% each.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Lookahead优化器进行了严格的稳定性和泛化性分析，消除了对损失函数全局Lipschitz连续性的限制性假设，为凸和强凸问题推导了泛化边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lookahead优化器通过双权重更新机制提升了深度学习模型性能，但现有理论研究主要关注训练数据上的收敛性，对其泛化能力理解不足。现有泛化分析存在限制性假设且未能充分捕捉优化与泛化之间的关系。

Method: 利用平均模型稳定性方法，对使用小批量SGD的Lookahead优化器进行分析，为凸和强凸问题推导泛化边界。

Result: 分析表明在凸设置下，泛化性能随批量大小呈现线性加速效果。

Conclusion: 本研究为Lookahead优化器提供了更严格的泛化理论保证，突破了现有分析的局限性，为理解其优化-泛化关系提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: The Lookahead optimizer enhances deep learning models by employing a
dual-weight update mechanism, which has been shown to improve the performance
of underlying optimizers such as SGD. However, most theoretical studies focus
on its convergence on training data, leaving its generalization capabilities
less understood. Existing generalization analyses are often limited by
restrictive assumptions, such as requiring the loss function to be globally
Lipschitz continuous, and their bounds do not fully capture the relationship
between optimization and generalization. In this paper, we address these issues
by conducting a rigorous stability and generalization analysis of the Lookahead
optimizer with minibatch SGD. We leverage on-average model stability to derive
generalization bounds for both convex and strongly convex problems without the
restrictive Lipschitzness assumption. Our analysis demonstrates a linear
speedup with respect to the batch size in the convex setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自回归语言模型和蒙特卡洛树搜索的方法在处理长程依赖时效果不佳，且搜索空间过大导致效率低下。

Method: 使用生物物理保真度增强的扩散去噪作为rollout引擎，结合多专家集成和pLDDT掩码调度，提出PH-UCT-ME多专家选择规则。

Result: 在CAMEO和PDB基准测试中，MCTD-ME在序列恢复(AAR)和结构相似性(scTM)方面优于单专家和无指导基线，对长蛋白质效果更显著。

Conclusion: 该框架具有模型无关性，可应用于逆折叠之外的蛋白质从头设计和多目标分子生成等任务。

Abstract: The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into
functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining
autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle
with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search
space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts,
which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token
planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME
uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine,
jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It
further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided
by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while
preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule
(PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse
folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and
unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity
(scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from
multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and
applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and
multi-objective molecular generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MetaBBO方法通常使用CoCo-BBOB基准套件作为训练集，但该套件中的问题实例多样性有限，容易导致元学习策略过拟合，从而影响在未见问题实例上的泛化性能。

Method: LSRE方法首先训练一个自编码器将高维问题特征映射到2维潜在空间，然后在该空间进行均匀网格采样以获得多样化的隐藏表示，最后使用遗传编程方法搜索与这些表示具有最小L2距离的函数公式，生成名为Diverse-BBO的多样化问题集。

Result: 实验结果表明，在Diverse-BBO上训练的各种MetaBBO在合成和现实场景中都表现出更好的泛化性能，优于现有训练集选择。

Conclusion: LSRE方法通过生成多样化的问题实例有效提升了MetaBBO的泛化能力，消融研究不仅验证了LSRE设计选择的有效性，还揭示了实例多样性与MetaBBO泛化之间的有趣关系。

Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization
algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage
generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based
algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which
automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem
instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs
is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the
MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited
in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further
results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance
generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse
training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.
LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features
into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space
leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.
By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with
minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a
diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the
effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe
their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.
Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to
existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only
demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal
interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车深度学习框架在部署时面临极端温度环境（-40°C至50°C），温度波动导致GPU频率动态调整，进而引发计算延迟、精度错误和同步问题等质量问题，而现有测试方法忽略温度影响。

Method: ThermalGuardian采用模型变异规则生成针对温度敏感算子的测试输入模型，基于牛顿冷却定律模拟GPU温度波动，并根据实时GPU温度控制频率。

Result: 该方法能够检测到温度引起的计算密集型算子延迟、高/混合精度算子精度错误以及时间序列算子同步问题等关键质量问题。

Conclusion: ThermalGuardian填补了现有深度学习框架测试方法在温度变化环境下的空白，为汽车深度学习框架的可靠部署提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems,
supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate
model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive
deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT
in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud,
vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from
-40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally,
heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase.
These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments
through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks
are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency
variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer
critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors,
high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series
operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot
be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they
ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge
this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning
framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically,
ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules
targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature
fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based
on real-time GPU temperature.

Motivation: Muon优化器在处理矩阵结构参数方面表现出色，但其理论分析仅能达到次优收敛率，存在理论与实践之间的显著差距。

Method: 构建并分析了方差缩减变体Muon-VR2，通过严格的数学证明展示了其收敛性能，并在Polyak-Łojasiewicz条件下建立了收敛保证。

Result: Muon-VR2达到了最优收敛率Õ(T^{-1/3})，匹配了该类问题的理论下界，在CIFAR-10和C4基准测试中验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次证明了Muon风格优化器的最优性，为开发更实用的加速变体指明了方向。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated remarkable empirical success in handling
matrix-structured parameters for training neural networks. However, a
significant gap persists between its practical performance and theoretical
understanding. Existing analyses indicate that the standard Muon variant
achieves only a suboptimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$ in
stochastic non-convex settings, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. To
explore the theoretical limits of the Muon framework, we construct and analyze
a variance-reduced variant, termed Muon-VR2. We provide the first rigorous
proof that incorporating a variance-reduction mechanism enables Muon-VR2 to
attain an optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, thereby
matching the theoretical lower bound for this class of problems. Moreover, our
analysis establishes convergence guarantees for Muon variants under the
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition. Extensive experiments on vision
(CIFAR-10) and language (C4) benchmarks corroborate our theoretical findings on
per-iteration convergence. Overall, this work provides the first proof of
optimality for a Muon-style optimizer and clarifies the path toward developing
more practically efficient, accelerated variants.

Motivation: 当前太阳辐照度预测解决方案缺乏电网运营商所需的时间和空间分辨率，需要更准确的日前预测来支持大规模光伏系统并网。

Method: 使用新颖的图神经网络来利用输入数据的模态间和模态内相关性，结合卫星图像和地面气象站时间序列数据，生成概率预测。

Result: 在瑞士127个地点的一年数据集上测试，预测范围内的归一化平均绝对误差为6.1%，与商业数值天气预报服务的性能相当。

Conclusion: SolarCrossFormer在真实操作中具有鲁棒性，能够在不重新训练模型的情况下整合新数据，并且仅使用坐标就能为没有输入数据的位置生成预测。

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the
large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid.
However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution
required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a
novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines
satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological
stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the
inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy
and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any
location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours
ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real
life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the
model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input
data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of
one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield
a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The
results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather
prediction service.

Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their
performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently
effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a
hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a
customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages
feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable
in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the
neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly
outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional
experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited
for solving large-scale ILPs.

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we
propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory
with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients
from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware
similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay
this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence
guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy
Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View
Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across
hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate
HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular
patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced
communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods.
Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for
collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data.
Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence,
adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new
standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced
math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while
ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了EvoBrain模型，通过理论分析和实验验证，解决了动态GNN在癫痫检测中无法充分捕捉脑状态动态变化的问题，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态GNN方法存在两个主要问题：1）基于时间固定的静态图，无法反映癫痫进展过程中脑连接的动态演化；2）时间信号和图结构的联合建模及其交互作用研究不足，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出EvoBrain模型，整合双流Mamba架构和经拉普拉斯位置编码增强的GCN，遵循神经学洞察，并引入显式动态图结构，使节点和边都能随时间演化。

Conclusion: 理论分析证明了显式动态建模和"时间优先图"方法的表达能力优势，EvoBrain模型在癫痫检测任务上表现出显著性能改进。

Abstract: Dynamic GNNs, which integrate temporal and spatial features in
Electroencephalography (EEG) data, have shown great potential in automating
seizure detection. However, fully capturing the underlying dynamics necessary
to represent brain states, such as seizure and non-seizure, remains a
non-trivial task and presents two fundamental challenges. First, most existing
dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to
reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression.
Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures
and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in
inconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first
theoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and
necessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.
Building on these insights, we propose EvoBrain, a novel seizure detection
model that integrates a two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by
Laplacian Positional Encoding, following neurological insights. Moreover,
EvoBrain incorporates explicitly dynamic graph structures, allowing both nodes
and edges to evolve over time. Our contributions include (a) a theoretical
analysis proving the expressivity advantage of explicit dynamic modeling and
time-then-graph over other approaches, (b) a novel and efficient model that
significantly improves AUROC by 23% and F1 score by 30%, compared with the
dynamic GNN baseline, and (c) broad evaluations of our method on the
challenging early seizure prediction tasks.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine
learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on
underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research
has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these
models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive
performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close
the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require
substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.
Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this
work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space
of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple
linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail
classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of
trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the
linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT
benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark,
highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦遗忘方法主要在事后处理，难以有效擦除神经网络深度记忆的数据信息。需要设计一种天生适合遗忘的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了基于变换引导的联邦遗忘框架ToFU，在训练过程中引入变换组合来限制实例特定信息的记忆，可作为即插即用框架提升现有方法性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和MUFAC基准测试中，ToFU优于现有基线方法，与现有方法集成时能提升性能，并减少遗忘时间。

Conclusion: ToFU框架通过转变学习范式，实现了更有效的联邦遗忘，为隐私保护的联邦学习系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural networks unintentionally memorize training data, creating privacy
risks in federated learning (FL) systems, such as inference and reconstruction
attacks on sensitive data. To mitigate these risks and to comply with privacy
regulations, Federated Unlearning (FU) has been introduced to enable
participants in FL systems to remove their data's influence from the global
model. However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to
efficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks. We argue
that effective unlearning necessitates a paradigm shift: designing FL systems
inherently amenable to forgetting. To this end, we propose a
learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework
that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce
memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how
transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information,
directly simplifying subsequent unlearning. Crucially, ToFU can work as a
plug-and-play framework that improves the performance of existing FU methods.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the MUFAC benchmark show that ToFU
outperforms existing FU baselines, enhances performance when integrated with
current methods, and reduces unlearning time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在多个领域表现出明显优势，但其高采样成本（需要数十次顺序模型评估）仍然是主要限制。现有方法主要通过优化求解器或蒸馏来加速采样，但每个查询都是独立处理的

Method: 提出SAGE框架，包含共享采样方案以提高效率，以及定制化训练策略以保持质量。通过共享语义相似查询的早期采样阶段来减少总步数

Result: 实验表明SAGE将采样成本降低25.5%，同时提高生成质量：FID降低5.0%，CLIP得分提高5.4%，多样性提高160%

Conclusion: SAGE通过语义感知的共享采样机制，在保持甚至提高生成质量的同时显著降低了扩散模型的采样成本，为解决扩散模型效率问题提供了新思路

Abstract: Diffusion models manifest evident benefits across diverse domains, yet their
high sampling cost, requiring dozens of sequential model evaluations, remains a
major limitation. Prior efforts mainly accelerate sampling via optimized
solvers or distillation, which treat each query independently. In contrast, we
reduce total number of steps by sharing early-stage sampling across
semantically similar queries. To enable such efficiency gains without
sacrificing quality, we propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling
framework that integrates a shared sampling scheme for efficiency and a
tailored training strategy for quality preservation. Extensive experiments show
that SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5%, while improving generation quality
with 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity over
baselines.

Motivation: 当前白血病诊断主要依赖人工显微镜分析，过程复杂耗时。现有AI解决方案大多使用私有数据集且仅覆盖部分诊断流程，因此需要开发覆盖整个诊断过程的公开数据集和AI方法。

Method: 创建包含246名儿科患者的综合数据集，包含诊断、临床和实验室信息，超过40,000个带边界框标注的细胞，其中28,000多个有高质量类别标签。基于此数据集开发了细胞检测、细胞分类和诊断预测的AI模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法证明了AI辅助诊断的有效性，该数据集将促进该领域的进一步研究和开发，最终有助于更精确的诊断和改善患者预后。

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone
marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it
complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the
diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly
available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process,
from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose
methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The
dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and
laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and
more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most
comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded
an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of
0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean
F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.
While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted
diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the
field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient
outcomes.

Motivation: 真实世界应用中昂贵的交互成本需要更高效的强化学习智能体，而基础模型具有广泛的知识和推理能力，但如何有效整合到强化学习框架中尚不明确。

Method: 在适合当前大语言模型（LLMs）的网格世界环境中，实证评估了两种策略：1）使用基础世界模型利用FMs的先验知识进行模拟交互训练；2）使用基础智能体利用FMs的推理能力进行决策。

Result: 研究结果表明：LLMs的改进直接提升了FWMs和FAs的性能；基于当前LLMs的FAs在简单环境中已能提供优秀策略；FWMs与强化学习智能体的结合在具有部分可观测性和随机性的复杂环境中极具潜力。

Conclusion: 基础模型在提高强化学习样本效率方面具有重要价值，特别是基础世界模型与强化学习的耦合为复杂环境下的决策问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning from scratch has shown impressive results in
solving sequential decision-making tasks with efficient simulators, real-world
applications with expensive interactions require more sample-efficient agents.
Foundation models (FMs) are natural candidates to improve sample efficiency as
they possess broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but it is yet unclear
how to effectively integrate them into the reinforcement learning framework. In
this paper, we anticipate and, most importantly, evaluate two promising
strategies. First, we consider the use of foundation world models (FWMs) that
exploit the prior knowledge of FMs to enable training and evaluating agents
with simulated interactions. Second, we consider the use of foundation agents
(FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making. We
evaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments
that are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs).
Our results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better
FWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent
policies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs
and reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings
with partial observability and stochastic elements.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is an essential tool for advertisers to enhance their
advertising performance. Recent progress has shown that AI-Generated Bidding
(AIGB), which formulates the auto-bidding as a trajectory generation task and
trains a conditional diffusion-based planner on offline data, achieves superior
and stable performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning
(RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still encounter
a performance bottleneck due to their neglect of fine-grained generation
quality evaluation and inability to explore beyond static datasets. To address
this, we propose AIGB-Pearl (\emph{Planning with EvAluator via RL}), a novel
method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The key to
AIGB-Pearl is to construct a non-bootstrapped \emph{trajectory evaluator} to
assign rewards and guide policy search, enabling the planner to optimize its
generation quality iteratively through interaction. Furthermore, to enhance
trajectory evaluator accuracy in offline settings, we incorporate three key
techniques: (i) a Large Language Model (LLM)-based architecture for better
representational capacity, (ii) hybrid point-wise and pair-wise losses for
better score learning, and (iii) adaptive integration of expert feedback for
better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
our approach.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical
expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a
highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been
the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning
methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with
its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has
emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However,
its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often
limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for
symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key
innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying
globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under
polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping
actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to
promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape
the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and
efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these
improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression
methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box
datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto
frontier of accuracy versus model complexity. Code is available at

Method: 建立两阶段级联模型U→H→Y|S，引入认知容量C_cog|S和平均总容量C_tot|S，结合Fano下界和PAC-Bayes上界构建容量耦合的对齐性能区间。

Result: 推导出数据规模无关的性能界限，证明在固定价值复杂度和容量下，仅增加标签无法突破界限；处理更复杂目标需要容量随logM增长；容量饱和后优化会拟合信道规律。

Conclusion: 将对齐视为接口工程问题：测量和分配有限容量、管理任务复杂性、决定信息使用位置，为理解对齐偏差提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Large language models improve with scale, yet feedback-based alignment still
exhibits systematic deviations from intended behavior. Motivated by bounded
rationality in economics and cognitive science, we view judgment as
resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel. On this basis, we model
the loop as a two-stage cascade $U \to H \to Y$ given $S$, with cognitive
capacity $C_{\text{cog}|S}$ and average total capacity
$\bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. Our main result is a capacity-coupled Alignment
Performance Interval. It pairs a data size-independent Fano lower bound proved
on a separable codebook mixture with a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is
controlled by the same channel via $m \, \bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. The PAC-Bayes
bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical
observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under
these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity.
Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding
labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex
targets requires capacity that grows with $\log M$; and once useful signal
saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities,
consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking. The analysis views
alignment as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity,
manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates physics and data into the
learning process, offering improved generalization compared with purely
data-driven models. Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics
remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial
differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust
uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic
prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN
architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware
predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where
insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat
diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior
distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior
distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The
framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with
real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a
dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable
prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This
capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance
decision-making in critical power assets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the in-hand pose of an object based on its CAD model
is crucial in both industrial applications and everyday tasks, ranging from
positioning workpieces and assembling components to seamlessly inserting
devices like USB connectors. While existing methods often rely on regression,
feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and
generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this
paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation.
The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by
iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final
stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates.
These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is
trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates
gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that
quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea
from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture
within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real
performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive
experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on
regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong
intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our
approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and
uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance
across a variety of real-world conditions.

Method: 采用损失相对影响分析结合类容量二元交叉熵损失，对有益样本进行一阶更新；同时提出二阶影响对齐更新策略，并与自影响校正相关联。

Result: 在单目标场景中，该方法能持续改善比特错误率，接近理想性能，显著优于随机微调；但多目标适应效果有限，凸显了现有挑战。

Conclusion: 影响函数不仅可作为深度学习接收器的可解释性工具，还能为高效接收器自适应提供基础，展现了其在无线通信领域的应用价值。

Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based
wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver,
influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions,
enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that
loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and
first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error
rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in
single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective,
underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to
self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update
strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability
tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出AGF-TI方法解决图多视图半监督学习中的视图缺失问题，通过对抗图融合和低秩张量学习缓解子簇问题，提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理视图缺失时忽视缺失样本导致的局部结构不连续（子簇问题），这会破坏标签传播的基本平滑假设，扭曲图融合并降低分类性能。

Method: 设计对抗图融合方案通过min-max框架学习鲁棒共识图；使用低秩张量学习从高阶一致性信息恢复不完整结构；结合锚点策略降低计算复杂度；开发高效交替优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了AGF-TI相比最先进方法的优越性。

Conclusion: AGF-TI能有效缓解子簇问题，提升不完全多视图半监督学习的性能，具有理论收敛保证。

Abstract: View missing remains a significant challenge in graph-based multi-view
semi-supervised learning, hindering their real-world applications. To address
this issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus
on mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label
propagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples
sometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking
the fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster
Problem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification
performance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view
semi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an
adversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the
distorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all
similarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure
from the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor
learning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the
computational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm
combining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the
formulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental
results on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 强化学习工作流存在异质性和动态性，导致现有系统硬件利用率低、训练速度慢，主要瓶颈在于系统灵活性不足。

Method: 提出M2Flow设计范式，自动分解和重组RL工作流，结合自适应通信、上下文切换、弹性流水线和基于性能分析的调度策略。

Result: 在推理RL和具身RL任务上，RLinf相比最先进系统实现了1.1倍到2.13倍的端到端训练吞吐量加速。

Conclusion: RLinf通过创新的系统设计范式有效解决了RL训练的效率瓶颈，为高性能RL系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing
artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied
intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL
workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing
systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system
based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training
lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is
built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow
transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level,
easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and
recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's
adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic
pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling
policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both
reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in
end-to-end training throughput.

TL;DR: EmoHeal是一个端到端的个性化心理健康系统，通过检测27种细粒度情绪并基于音乐治疗原则生成个性化叙事，有效改善用户情绪状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字心理健康工具忽视日常挑战背后的细微情绪状态，如影响超过15亿人的睡前焦虑，当前方法过于静态且缺乏个性化适应性。

Method: 使用微调的XLM-RoBERTa模型检测用户文本中的27种细粒度情绪，通过基于音乐治疗原则的知识图谱将情绪映射到音乐参数，利用CLAMP3模型检索视听内容，采用"匹配-引导-目标"三阶段叙事方法。

Result: 在40名参与者的组内研究中，系统显示出显著的支持效果，参与者报告情绪明显改善（M=4.12, p<0.001）和高感知情绪识别准确度（M=4.05, p<0.001），感知准确度与治疗效果呈强相关（r=0.72, p<0.001）。

Conclusion: 研究验证了理论驱动、情绪感知的数字健康工具的可行性，为音乐治疗原则的可扩展AI实施提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Existing digital mental wellness tools often overlook the nuanced emotional
states underlying everyday challenges. For example, pre-sleep anxiety affects
more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, yet current approaches remain largely
static and "one-size-fits-all", failing to adapt to individual needs. In this
work, we present EmoHeal, an end-to-end system that delivers personalized,
three-stage supportive narratives. EmoHeal detects 27 fine-grained emotions
from user text with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model, mapping them to musical
parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music therapy principles (GEMS,
iso-principle). EmoHeal retrieves audiovisual content using the CLAMP3 model to
guide users from their current state toward a calmer one
("match-guide-target"). A within-subjects study (N=40) demonstrated significant
supportive effects, with participants reporting substantial mood improvement
(M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05,
p<0.001). A strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic
outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates our fine-grained approach. These findings
establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools
and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy
principles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种逆优化潜变量模型（IO-LVM），用于学习约束优化问题（COP）成本函数的潜空间分布，通过求解器在环中重建可行解，能够捕捉不同代理或条件下产生的多样化解行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型如变分自编码器在解码结构化输出时难以强制执行约束，而标准逆优化方法通常只能恢复单一或上下文特定的成本函数，无法捕捉成本函数的分布。

Method: 使用求解器在环中的逆优化潜变量模型，通过Fenchel-Young损失的估计梯度来塑造潜空间，学习COP成本函数的潜空间分布。

Result: 在真实世界的船舶和出租车路线数据集以及合成图中的路径上验证了方法，能够重建路径和循环，预测其分布，并产生可解释的潜表示。

Conclusion: IO-LVM能够有效学习COP成本函数的分布，识别训练过程中不可用的不同代理或条件产生的多样化解行为，为约束优化问题的表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning representations for solutions of constrained optimization problems
(COPs) with unknown cost functions is challenging, as models like (Variational)
Autoencoders struggle to enforce constraints when decoding structured outputs.
We propose an Inverse Optimization Latent Variable Model (IO-LVM) that learns a
latent space of COP cost functions from observed solutions and reconstructs
feasible outputs by solving a COP with a solver in the loop. Our approach
leverages estimated gradients of a Fenchel-Young loss through a
non-differentiable deterministic solver to shape the latent space. Unlike
standard Inverse Optimization or Inverse Reinforcement Learning methods, which
typically recover a single or context-specific cost function, IO-LVM captures a
distribution over cost functions, enabling the identification of diverse
solution behaviors arising from different agents or conditions not available
during the training process. We validate our method on real-world datasets of
ship and taxi routes, as well as paths in synthetic graphs, demonstrating its
ability to reconstruct paths and cycles, predict their distributions, and yield
interpretable latent representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要自动化分析在线言论以识别极端主义和恐怖主义倾向，传统方法效率低下，需要更有效的检测和追踪技术。

Method: 使用通用句子编码器提取文本特征，训练支持向量机分类器，结合追踪算法进行时间序列分析，从wikiquote.org获取839条引文作为测试数据。

Result: 系统在10折交叉验证中，极端主义检测准确率81%，恐怖主义检测准确率97%，优于基于n-gram的基线系统，追踪算法能有效检测态度变化趋势。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别极端主义和恐怖主义言论，追踪技术可监测态度变化，为在线安全监控提供实用工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for automatically analysing and tracking
statements in material gathered online and detecting whether the authors of the
statements are likely to be involved in extremism or terrorism. The proposed
system comprises: online collation of statements that are then encoded in a
form amenable to machine learning (ML), an ML component to classify the encoded
text, a tracker, and a visualisation system for analysis of results. The
detection and tracking concept has been tested using quotes made by terrorists,
extremists, campaigners, and politicians, obtained from wikiquote.org. A set of
features was extracted for each quote using the state-of-the-art Universal
Sentence Encoder (Cer et al. 2018), which produces 512-dimensional vectors. The
data were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier
using 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect
intentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and
terrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was
higher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on
n-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal
analysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a
person's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were
able to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could
be attributed to major events.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TSympNets的扩展，用于学习非自治哈密顿系统的时间自适应辛积分器，并提供了可分离哈密顿系统的通用逼近定理，同时修正了先前辛映射逼近定理中的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习方法（如SympNets和HénonNets）需要固定步长的训练数据，但实际测量数据往往在不规则时间网格上采样。为了学习时间自适应的辛积分器，需要扩展TSympNets架构以处理非自治哈密顿系统。

Method: 扩展TSympNets架构，使其适用于非自治哈密顿系统。通过数值实验验证理论逼近能力，并修正先前辛映射逼近定理中的错误。

Result: 提供了可分离哈密顿系统的通用逼近定理，证明无法将其扩展到非可分离哈密顿系统。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: TSympNets在可分离哈密顿系统中具有通用逼近能力，但在非可分离系统中存在局限性。修正的定理为辛机器学习方法提供了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly i.e. not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [20] and
H\'enonNets [4] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets, which we
call TSympNets, was introduced in [20]. We adapt the architecture of TSympNets
and extend them to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. So far the approximation
qualities of TSympNets were unknown. We close this gap by providing a universal
approximation theorem for separable Hamiltonian systems and show that it is not
possible to extend it to non-separable Hamiltonian systems. To investigate
these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical
experiments. Furthermore we fix a mistake in a proof of a substantial theorem
[25, Theorem 2] for the approximation of symplectic maps in general, but
specifically for symplectic machine learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个完全自动化的本构模型发现框架，结合三种稀疏回归算法（LASSO、LARS、OMP）和三种模型选择标准（CV、AIC、BIC），系统性地探索稀疏性、预测性能和计算成本之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型校准方法存在局限性，需要开发自动化的本构模型发现方法来替代传统范式。

Method: 使用LASSO、LARS、OMP三种稀疏回归算法分别与CV、AIC、BIC三种模型选择标准配对，形成九种不同的算法组合，应用于各向同性和各向异性超弹性材料的本构模型发现。

Result: 所有九种算法-标准组合在各向同性和各向异性材料发现中都表现一致良好，能够产生高精度的本构模型。

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了可行的发现算法范围，超越了基于ℓ1的方法如LASSO，证明了多种稀疏回归算法在本构模型发现中的有效性。

Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged
as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In
this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model
discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression
(LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection
criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct
algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the
trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost.
While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the
$\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for
$\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and
anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental
datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform
consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials,
yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range
of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs经过安全对齐训练，但它们仍然容易受到越狱攻击。研究发现LLMs的安全机制主要嵌入在中间到后期层中。

Method: SABER方法通过连接两个中间层s和e（s<e）的残差连接来绕过安全对齐，这是一种白盒攻击方法。

Result: 在HarmBench测试集上实现51%的性能提升，在验证集上仅引起边际困惑度变化。

Conclusion: SABER方法有效揭示了LLMs安全机制的脆弱性，为改进模型安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with safe-alignment training are powerful
instruments with robust language comprehension capabilities. These models
typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to
ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.
However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to
produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,
we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the
middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box
jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which
connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a
residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the
best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces
only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation
set. The source code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 这种跨学科方法展示了利用非传统数据源和深度学习进行先进环境监测和实时大气应用的变革潜力。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various
applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk
reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains
challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote
sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast
three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward
Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear,
and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind
dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind
retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with
skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios.
The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure
levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior
agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data.
Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for
localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations
(e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This
interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of
exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced
environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.

Result: 在分类、回归和预测任务上的综合评估表明，该方法相比竞争基线实现了持续且优越的性能。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化这些目标，DMAE能够学习到时间一致且语义丰富的表示，在多个下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to
extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without
relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked
time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning.
DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked
values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations
of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve
representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that
encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's
outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally
coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations
across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our
approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive
baselines.

Abstract: A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not
guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable
attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large
combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown
limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To
tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for
synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given
molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in
synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the
synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic
pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically,
inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the
chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction
types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR
notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly
learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform
step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning
capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning
and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable
projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway
diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization
performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and
significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in
synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability
to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.

TL;DR: 本文提出将随机平滑（RS）技术应用于生成模型，通过将生成输出连接到oracle分类任务，为视觉语言模型（VLMs）提供鲁棒性认证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机平滑在分类任务中已被证明有效，但其在生成模型中的应用尚不明确，因为生成模型的输出是序列而非标签。本文旨在解决这一问题，为VLMs提供鲁棒性保障。

Method: 将生成输出映射到oracle分类任务（如服务机器人命令分类、有害内容检测等），在oracle分类器的错误率有界的前提下，建立样本数量与鲁棒性半径的理论关联。

Result: 推导了改进的缩放定律，分析证明了认证半径和准确率与样本数量的关系，验证了即使假设较弱，之前关于样本数量减少2-3个数量级的结果仍然有效。

Conclusion: 该方法使鲁棒性认证在最新VLMs中既定义明确又计算可行，并在对抗性攻击测试中验证了有效性。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing (RS) is one of the prominent techniques to ensure the
correctness of machine learning models, where point-wise robustness
certificates can be derived analytically. While RS is well understood for
classification, its application to generative models is unclear, since their
outputs are sequences rather than labels. We resolve this by connecting
generative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can
still be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action
(e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content
moderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster
answers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the
oracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates
the number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further
derive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and
accuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3
orders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid
even under weaker assumptions. Together, these advances make robustness
certification both well-defined and computationally feasible for
state-of-the-art VLMs, as validated against recent jailbreak-style adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: We present a robust personalized federated learning framework that leverages
heat-kernel enhanced tensorized multi-view fuzzy c-means clustering with
advanced tensor decomposition techniques. Our approach integrates heat-kernel
coefficients adapted from quantum field theory with Tucker decomposition and
canonical polyadic decomposition (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) to transform conventional
distance metrics and efficiently represent high-dimensional multi-view
structures. The framework employs matriculation and vectorization techniques to
facilitate the discovery of hidden structures and multilinear relationships via
N-way generalized tensors. The proposed method introduces a dual-level
optimization scheme: local heat-kernel enhanced fuzzy clustering with tensor
decomposition operating on order-N input tensors, and federated aggregation of
tensor factors with privacy-preserving personalization mechanisms. The local
stage employs tensorized kernel Euclidean distance transformations and Tucker
decomposition to discover client-specific patterns in multi-view tensor data,
while the global aggregation process coordinates tensor factors (core tensors
and factor matrices) across clients through differential privacy-preserving
protocols. This tensorized approach enables efficient handling of
high-dimensional multi-view data with significant communication savings through
low-rank tensor approximations.

TL;DR: DiffusionNFT是一种新的在线强化学习范式，通过流匹配直接在正向过程中优化扩散模型，解决了现有方法在离散化反向采样过程中存在的求解器限制、前后向不一致等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线强化学习方法在扩散模型中的应用面临挑战，包括难以处理的似然函数、求解器限制、前后向不一致以及与无分类器引导的复杂集成问题。

Method: DiffusionNFT通过流匹配在正向过程中优化扩散模型，对比正负生成样本来定义隐式策略改进方向，将强化信号自然融入监督学习目标。

Result: DiffusionNFT比FlowGRPO效率高25倍，在1k步内将GenEval分数从0.24提升到0.98，而FlowGRPO需要超过5k步和额外CFG才能达到0.95。使用多个奖励模型时，DiffusionNFT显著提升了SD3.5-Medium在所有基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: DiffusionNFT提供了一个高效、灵活的在线RL框架，无需似然估计，仅需干净图像而非采样轨迹，且与CFG兼容，为扩散模型的强化学习优化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language
models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to
intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process
to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,
including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated
integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion
Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that
optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.
DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit
policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals
into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with
arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and
requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy
optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in
head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT
improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO
achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging
multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of
SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态CFG调度框架，通过在线反馈评估生成质量，为每个提示和样本定制独特的指导计划，显著提升文本对齐、视觉质量和文本渲染能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的静态指导尺度方法无法适应不同提示的多样化需求，现有解决方案如基于梯度的校正或固定启发式调度引入额外复杂性且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 利用CLIP对齐、鉴别器保真度和人类偏好奖励模型等小规模潜在空间评估的在线反馈，在反向扩散过程的每个步骤评估生成质量，通过贪婪搜索为每个时间步选择最优CFG尺度。

Result: 在Imagen 3等模型上实现显著改进，相比基线获得高达53.8%的人类偏好胜率，在文本渲染等特定能力提示上达到55.5%的胜率。

Conclusion: 最优指导计划本质上是动态且依赖于提示的，本文提供了一个高效且可泛化的框架来实现这一目标。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion
models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.
This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of
different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or
fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to
generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a
framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from
a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space
evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a
human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the
reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search
to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance
schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,
showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text
rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default
Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate
for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts
targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that
the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and
provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多场时空深度学习模型（MSTM），能够统一预测多孔材料和结构材料中冲击波的传播，比直接模拟快约1000倍，误差低于4%-10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测冲击波在多孔和结构材料中的传播对于行星防御、国家安全和惯性约束聚变能至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉孔隙塌陷、异常Hugoniot响应和局部加热等关键现象。

Method: 引入多场时空深度学习模型（MSTM），将七个耦合场（压力、密度、温度、能量、材料分布和两个速度分量）统一到一个自回归代理模型中，基于高保真流体动力学代码数据进行训练。

Result: MSTM比直接模拟快约1000倍，在多孔材料中误差低于4%，在晶格结构中误差低于10%，能够解析尖锐冲击前沿同时保持质量平均压力和温度等积分量误差在5%以内。

Conclusion: 这一进展将曾经被认为难以处理的问题转化为可处理的设计研究，为优化行星撞击缓解、惯性约束聚变能和国家安全中的介观结构材料建立了实用框架。

Abstract: The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected
materials is a decisive factor in planetary defense, national security, and the
race to achieve inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous
Hugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the
success of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major
challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations.
We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that
unifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy,
material distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single
autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs
about a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below
4\% in porous materials and below 10\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior
single-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts
while preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and
temperature to within 5\%. This advance transforms problems once considered
intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework
for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation,
inertial fusion energy, and national security.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图表示的深度强化学习方法用于自动网络防御，通过将网络表示为属性图来解决传统方法对特定网络拓扑过拟合的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习方法将网络表示为计算机状态列表，这种方法会过度拟合特定网络拓扑，在环境发生微小变化时就会失效。

Method: 将自动网络防御框架化为基于上下文的部分可观察马尔可夫决策问题，使用属性图作为观察表示，引入关系归纳偏置，使智能体能够以更通用的方式推理主机与其他系统实体的交互。

Result: 该方法在性能上大幅超越现有最先进技术，使智能体能够在零样本情况下适应新网络，并在各种复杂多智能体环境中防御多种攻击者。

Conclusion: 通过图表示和关系归纳偏置，该方法显著提高了自动网络防御系统的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable strategy for
automated cyber defense (ACD). The traditional RL approach represents networks
as a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately,
these models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering
them ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In
this work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable
Markov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs.
This approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational
inductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other
system entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as
edits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we
will show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and
zero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending
never-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of
complex, and multi-agent environments.

Motivation: 训练大规模深度神经网络计算成本高昂，传统方法主要关注学习率调整，而批次大小调整面临效率与泛化性能的权衡挑战

Method: 基于梯度多样性的数据驱动自适应批次大小SGD算法，利用梯度多样性理论依据动态调整批次大小

Result: 在合成数据集和CiFar-10、CiFar-100、Tiny-ImageNet上评估，DiveBatch比标准SGD和AdaBatch收敛速度快1.06-5.0倍

Conclusion: DiveBatch在保持良好泛化性能的同时显著加速训练收敛，但存在轻微性能权衡

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to accelerate the training of machine learning
models, a critical challenge since the training of large-scale deep neural
models can be computationally expensive. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and
its variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to
traditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a
novel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts
the batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes
is more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often
converges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we
introduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling
DiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training
while improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient
diversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the
convergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and
CiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges
significantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a
slight trade-off in performance.

Conclusion: 当前机器学习系统的数据效率低部分原因是缺乏潜在学习能力。通过引入基于情景记忆的检索机制，可以显著改善系统的泛化性能，这为开发更高效的机器学习系统提供了重要方向。

Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms
could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive
science to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure
to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the
task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this
perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling
to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive
science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these
issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval
mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better
across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential
components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of
within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information
across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible
contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning
systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval
methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对LLM的触发器反演方法，解决了传统基于梯度的反演方法在离散输入空间中的挑战，通过离散搜索、隐式黑名单和高置信度检测来可靠地检测和反演后门触发器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门检测和反演方法主要针对图像AI，难以直接应用于LLM。LLM的输入空间是离散的，无法进行基于梯度的搜索；可能的触发器组合数量巨大；需要黑名单机制来避免误检，但某些领域可能缺乏合适的黑名单。

Method: 提出三个关键组件：1）离散搜索，从单例列表开始贪婪地累积候选触发器；2）隐式黑名单，通过计算候选触发器与目标类样本在激活空间的平均余弦相似度来实现；3）检测机制，当候选触发器引发高误分类率且决策置信度异常高时进行检测。

Result: 与许多近期工作不同，该方法能够可靠地检测并成功反演真实的后门触发器短语。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LLM后门检测的特殊挑战，为LLM安全提供了实用的触发器反演解决方案。

Abstract: While effective backdoor detection and inversion schemes have been developed
for AIs used e.g. for images, there are challenges in "porting" these methods
to LLMs. First, the LLM input space is discrete, which precludes gradient-based
search over this space, central to many backdoor inversion methods. Second,
there are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative
trigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong
marginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack,
as such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not
exist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three
key components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted,
starting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved
by evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a
candidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target
class; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications,
and with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we
demonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts
ground-truth backdoor trigger phrases.
