### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，在标签平滑基础上考虑非目标类间的相互关系，避免传统标签平滑对所有非目标类赋予相同权重的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑虽然能改善过拟合和过度自信问题，但为所有非目标类分配相同概率，破坏了类间关系

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++策略，为目标类使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类的标签，考虑类间关系

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过度自信预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过考虑类间关系，在保持标签平滑优势的同时进一步提升了模型性能

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应知识蒸馏(AKD)框架，通过动态调整硬标签和软标签损失的平衡因子alpha，使用学生-教师差异和上下文感知模块来优化知识蒸馏过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏使用固定的alpha超参数来平衡硬标签和软标签损失，但静态alpha不是最优的，因为硬软监督的最佳权衡在训练过程中会变化

Method: 1) 将alpha作为可学习参数自动优化；2) 基于学生-教师差异动态计算alpha；3) 引入上下文感知模块(CAM)，使用MLP+Attention自适应重加权教师输出的类别权重

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，使用ResNet-50作为教师网络、ResNet-18作为学生网络的实验表明，该方法相比固定权重KD基线获得更高的准确率，并实现更稳定的收敛

Conclusion: 自适应知识蒸馏框架通过动态调整损失平衡因子和引入上下文感知机制，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能和训练稳定性

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络剪枝中的效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找计算效率更高的网络剪枝方法，特别是在保持模型性能的同时减少网络复杂度。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种随机网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的RWNN进行选择性剪枝，应用于COVID-19胸部X光图像分类任务。

Result: FRC基于剪枝能有效简化RWNN，在保持与ORC相当性能的同时提供显著的计算优势，压缩后的网络在模块化和全局效率之间达到平衡。

Conclusion: 计算效率更高的FRC可以作为ORC的有效替代方案进行网络剪枝，为深度学习模型的压缩和优化提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集生成和两阶段推理机制，有效提升视觉语言模型在域偏移场景下的目标识别鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中目标识别模型面临多种域偏移（图像统计变化、姿态变化、遮挡、类间混淆）导致准确率严重下降，需要提升模型鲁棒性

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道产生包含4个线索（边界框、类名、对象级描述、场景级描述）的标注图像；对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优；推理时采用两阶段重思考机制：首先生成4个线索，然后作为证据重新检查并迭代修正

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM持续超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合是通向可靠且可迁移视觉理解的有前景路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了中文手写数据库和开源工具箱，通过大规模实验发现词汇因素（形态、音之等）在字符、部首和笔画不同层次对手写准备和执行的层级衰减影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言组件调控机制不清和缺乏细粒度数据捕获工具的问题，提供大规模数据资源和完善的分析工具。

Method: 构建大规模手写数据库（42名受试者手写1200个汉字），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具箱，支持实验设计修改、笔躍轨迹捕获和批量处理手写测量。采用多元回归分析数据。

Result: 形态因素在字符、部首和笔画三个层次都影响手写准备和执行；音之因素在所有层次影响执行。词汇效应呈现层级衰减特征：字符层最明显，部首层次之，笔画层最弱。

Conclusion: 手写准备和执行在部首和笔画层面与语言组件密切相关，数据库和工具箱为语言心理学和神经语言学手写研究提供价值资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

*Younggeol Cho,Gokhan Solak,Olivia Nocentini,Marta Lorenzini,Andrea Fortuna,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒事件，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务实现高精度早期跌倒检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但缺乏对跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动。输入为从视频序列提取的实时骨骼特征

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上训练验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现更优

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比统一处理方法能提升性能，同时可以监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统提供有价值的洞察

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVRF是一种基于蒸馏的无反演文本到图像编辑框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异来减少过平滑伪影，并引入时间相关偏移项来增强目标分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提高文本到图像编辑的质量和保真度。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF)框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异，引入时间相关偏移项将噪声潜在向量推向目标轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，且无需架构修改，高效适用于各种文本到图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: DVRF成功连接了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，实现了高质量的文本到图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统CNN在医学图像分析中难以捕捉细粒度特征，限制了诊断准确性。需要增强模型对关键区域的关注能力以提高判别性能。

Method: 在VGG16、ResNet18、InceptionV3、DenseNet121和EfficientNetB5五种CNN架构中集成Squeeze and Excitation块或混合Convolutional Block Attention Module，实现通道和空间特征的自适应重校准。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个系统性的注意力模块集成框架，证明了注意力机制在医学图像分析中的有效性，为开发鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的深度学习决策支持系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is
critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic
systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings
on solar panels. A custom dataset, annotated in the COCO format and
specifically designed for solar panel defect and contamination detection, was
developed alongside a user interface to train and evaluate the models. The
performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average
Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and inference speed. The results
demonstrate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting the relative strengths and limitations of each model.
These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection
approaches in practical solar panel monitoring and maintenance scenarios.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小波的频率感知变分自编码器(FA-VAE)框架，通过显式解耦低频和高频分量的优化，解决了现有潜在标记器在纹理区域重建时高频细节丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在生成模型的两阶段训练过程中，图像压缩为潜在嵌入的质量直接影响生成效果。传统目标函数固有地优先重建低频信息，导致高频保真度不足，重建图像缺乏真实感，特别是在具有尖锐过渡的纹理区域。

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对于实现真实图像表示至关重要，该方法在内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Motivation: 解决YOLO架构在资源受限环境（如无人机）中部署时的高效转移学习需求，探索不同冻结配置对当代YOLOv8和YOLOv10的具体影响

Method: 系统研究多种冻结配置，集成梯度行为分析（L2范数）和视觉解释（Grad-CAM）来提供深度洞察，使用4个关键基础设施监测数据集

Result: 没有通用的最佳冻结策略，而是依赖于数据特性。冻结背骨网络有效保留通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类不平衡。这些配置节省了至28%的GPU内存，mAP@50在某些情况下超过全量微调

Conclusion: 该研究提供了实证发现和实践指南，为资源受限场景下的对象检测转移学习提供了平衡的、基于证据的方法进距

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN框架成功地将四元数代数与深度学习相结合，在保持几何特性的同时实现了计算效率的提升，为旋转感知的计算机视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案，特别适合资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

<details>

Motivation: 现有表示学习方法主要针对动作识别任务，基于孤立序列表示，而动作分割需要利用多尺度表示和跨序列变化信息。

Method: 提出'Shuffle and Warp'数据增强策略生成多样化的多动作排列，引入Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC)和Relative Order Reasoning (ROR)两个对比学习代理任务，构建Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning网络。

Result: 在未修剪数据集上的评估显示，DuoCLR在多类和多标签动作分割任务中均显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过对比学习有效提升了动作分割性能，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: 通过重视事件流的本质不完整性和提出相应的稳健性策略，该方法有效提升了事件导向运动去模糊的性能

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Result: 实现90 FPS的高帧率渲染（分辨512x512），遵循缩放定律，驱动效率不受影响，定量和定性实验都超越当前最优方法

Conclusion: 该分离框架有效解决了单图输入虚拟人物生成的挑战，在渲染速度、质量和可控性方面都取得了显著成效

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MFFI多维度人脸伪造图像数据集，针对现有Deepfake检测数据集在真实场景多样性不足的问题，通过四个维度增强真实性：更广泛的伪造方法、多样化的面部场景、丰富的真实数据、多级退化操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Deepfake检测方法受限于现有数据集的多样性不足，无法很好地应对真实世界场景中的挑战，特别是在未知高级伪造技术、面部场景变化、真实数据丰富度和现实传播退化等方面存在局限。

Method: 构建MFFI数据集，基于四个策略维度：1）包含50种不同伪造方法的更广泛伪造技术；2）多样化的面部场景；3）多样化的真实数据；4）多级退化操作。数据集包含1024K图像样本。

Conclusion: MFFI数据集通过多维度增强真实性的设计，为Deepfake检测提供了更接近真实场景的基准数据集，有助于提升检测模型在现实应用中的性能。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

*Jungin Park,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph提出了一种基于语言引导的时空图建模方法，通过递归时空图网络将视频中的对象和帧分别建模为空间和时间图节点，实现了视频摘要的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的全局时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的关系。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语义信息。

Method: 将视频摘要视为语言引导的时空图建模问题，构建空间图（对象节点）和时间图（帧节点），通过图边表示节点间的语义关系。引入语言查询来丰富节点表示，避免仅依赖视觉相似性，并采用递归策略优化初始图结构。

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦视频摘要基准测试中，VideoGraph在监督和无监督设置下均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过语言引导的时空图建模能够有效捕捉视频中对象和帧的语义关系，递归图网络策略显著提升了视频摘要的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA)方法，通过自监督学习将预训练模型的语义知识转移到密集特征空间，在多个密集视觉任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督表示学习方法主要关注全局表示，难以捕捉密集预测任务所需的局部语义和精细细节

Method: 基于预训练表示进行额外自监督学习，使用PaKA目标对齐教师和学生模型的密集特征分布，匹配密集补丁间的统计依赖关系，并研究专门的数据增强策略

Result: 在多种密集视觉基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: PaKA方法能有效将语义知识转移到密集特征空间，提升密集视觉任务的性能

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的两级剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在VLA模型上实现显著加速且成功率损失可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限。研究发现连续动作间存在高度相似性，可以利用全局历史信息进行更智能的剪枝

Method: 提出静态剪枝（动作级别，利用全局历史和局部上下文减少视觉token）和动态剪枝（层级级别，基于层级重要性剪枝token），并配备轻量级动作感知控制器根据动作粒度调整剪枝强度

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，SpecPrune-VLA相比OpenVLA-OFT在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 通过结合局部和全局信息的两级剪枝策略，SpecPrune-VLA能够在不显著影响性能的情况下显著加速VLA模型的推理过程

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于有效擦除文本到图像扩散模型中的狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人），在保持图像质量的同时实现鲁棒的概念移除


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时满足鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于狭窄概念（如版权内容、名人）的擦除存在挑战，这些概念与非目标概念距离相近，需要更精细的操作

Method: SuMa方法首先推导出表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两个子空间距离的参考子空间来进行中和，确保目标概念被鲁棒擦除的同时保持图像质量

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除、实例擦除）上的广泛实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与专门针对完整性的方法结果相当

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了狭窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效的技术解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标签有限或无标签的情况下的分析具有挑战性，需要开发有效的自监督学习方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习框架，构建反映植被特性的嵌入空间，从航空高光谱图像中提取树木的神经网络嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于植被特性相关嵌入空间构建的树木表示，在下游机器学习任务中的性能优于直接使用高光谱植被特性作为树木表示的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效创建反映植被特性的神经网络嵌入，为高光谱图像分析提供了一种有效的无标签或有限标签学习方法，在精准农业应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

TL;DR: 研究评测了六种YOLO模型在孜加拉开特路况车辆检测中的表现，YOLOv11x突出但速度慢，中等模型在性能和速度间取得最佳平衡，屏障了少见车辆类别的检测困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为现有模型基于非孜加拉开特数据集训练，在孜国独特路况下车辆识别准确性差，影响自动驾驶技术在发展中地区的应用。

Method: 使用手机摄像头采集高清图片，手动标注包含29种本土车辆的数据集，对比测试六种YOLO模型变体的检测性能。

Result: YOLOv11x性能最优(mAP@0.5为63.7%)但速度慢(45.8ms)，YOLOv8m和YOLOv11m性能速度平衡最佳(mAP@0.5分别为62.5%和61.8%，速度约14-15ms)，屏障了少见车辆类别检测准确性差的问题。

Conclusion: 研究为孜加拉开特路况车辆检测提供了基础，展示了适配本土化车辆类别的重要性，并持续优化模型平衡性能与速度。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入设计，通过改进ID特征集成模块和引入多级训练策略，在保持身份一致性的同时实现深度语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往会出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多级语义编辑。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中保持身份一致性的同时实现深度语义编辑，满足长提示词和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的训练策略和模块设计，在保持身份一致性的前提下实现了高质量的复杂语义编辑。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的场景图预测方法OOTSM，通过两阶段对象导向方法先预测物体出现消失，再生成详细关系，在短期和长期预测上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好地理解场景中的对象、概念和关系

Method: 将场景图预测任务解耦为两步：先用场景图捕捉模型将视频转换为场景图序列，再用纯文本模型预测未来帧的场景图。提出OOTSM方法，使用LLM先预测物体出现消失，再生成详细的人-物关系

Result: 在LSGA任务上评估了微调的开源LLM与零样本API的性能。在SGA任务中与STTran++结合，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%

Conclusion: 提出的语言场景图预测方法有效整合了常识知识，显著提升了场景图预测性能，特别是在长期预测方面表现突出，为智能监控和人机协作等应用提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于高能物理堆积干扰消除原理，将物理导向的归纳偏见嵌入神经网络结构，提出了一系列受堆积启发的去噪模型，在高噪声条件下显示出更好的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高能粒子对冲机测量中的堆积干扰会污染确定性信号，传统消除策略利用保守性、局域性等物理前知。研究者受此启发，想要探索如何将这些物理导向的归纳偏见嵌入神经网络结构中，以提高图像去噪的稳健性。

Method: 提出了一个受堆积启发的去噪器层次结构：包括带有保守约束的殊差CNN、其高斯噪声变体，以及WIPUNet（结合了这些思想的UNet背锁模型）。这些模型将物理前知如保守性、局域性等作为模块化的归纳偏见嵌入网络结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上使用高斯噪声（模弊从15到100）进行测试，受堆积启发的CNN模型与标准基线相比具有竞争力，而WIPUNet在更高噪声水平下显示出了扩大的优势。在BSD500上的补充实验也显示了相同趋势，说明物理启发的前知能够在管纳数据驱动模型性能波动时提供稳定性。

Conclusion: 这项研究成功将高能物理堆积消除原理转换为可模块化的归纳偏见，并将其集成到UNet结构中，在不依赖重型SOTA机制的情况下展示了在高噪声条件下的稳健性收益。这为物理导向的神经网络设计提供了概念验证。

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现优秀，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉等挑战

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储管理视觉特征和文本语义表示；2) Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器注意力到相关图像区域

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF等多个挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR始终达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: CAMVR框架通过创新的记忆管理和注意力机制，显著提升了多轮视觉-文本推理的连贯性和准确性

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MeshMetrics，一个基于网格的框架，用于更精确地计算基于距离的分割评估指标，解决了现有网格方法中存在的实现不一致和离散化伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割研究虽然取得了显著性能提升，但暴露了可重复性危机。性能评估中度量指标的选择和实现都至关重要，而现有开源工具在距离度量实现上存在显著差异，导致结果不可靠。

Method: 开发了MeshMetrics框架，采用基于网格的方法而非传统的基于网格的方法来计算距离度量指标。通过理论分析和实证验证，证明该方法比现有工具具有更高的准确性和精度。

Result: MeshMetrics在Hausdorff距离和归一化表面距离等指标上表现出比现有工具更高的准确性，受距离量化等离散化伪影的影响显著减小。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics提供了一个更可靠的距离度量计算框架，解决了分割评估中的实现不一致问题，并作为开源Python包发布，有助于提高研究可重复性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个基于预训练视觉-语言大模型的视频动作识别框架，通过视频到语义标记转换和LoRA微调，在NTU RGB+D等基准上达到SOTA性能，同时提升模型可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分方面存在局限，需要利用大语言模型的强大能力来提升视频动作识别性能

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将原始视频转换为离散的语义动作标记，结合自然语言指令，通过LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行处理

Result: 在NTU RGB+D上达到94.1%（X-Sub），在NTU RGB+D 120上达到90.0%（X-Set）的SOTA性能，并生成自然语言解释

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR成功将预训练视觉-语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，在准确性和可解释性方面都取得了显著提升

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖RGB图像的语义特征，忽视了空间结构信息在捕获视角不变特征中的重要性。无人机地理定位中视角差异和外观变化带来巨大挑战。

Method: 使用双分支特征提取框架，结合差异感知融合模块(DAFM)和联合约束交互聚合(JCIA)策略，深度融合RGB和法线图像。提出3D地理增强技术生成视角变化样本。

Conclusion: 通过整合几何结构信息和语义信息，JRN-Geo网络能够有效处理跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，显著提升了定位性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制增强雷达/声纳到LiDAR的转换，在SLAM中实现更好的时空一致性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态传感器融合中的时间不一致问题，提升下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换任务中表现出改进的时空一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的多模态融合能力，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更好的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景模型和外参补偿方法，有效解决了多相机系统的融合问题，实现了高精度和鲁棒的状态估计

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于理论基础的距离适配性超分辨框架，通过空间变化逆问题模型和深度条件卷积核，有效处理实际影像系统中的距离依赖性退化效应，在多个标准数据集上实现了独创性的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨假设空间不变的退化模型，但真实影像系统存在复杂的距离依赖效应，如大气散射、景深变化和逆变矩阵。需要空间适配性重建策略来明确结合几何场景理解以获得最佳性能。

Method: 提出严格的变分框架，将超分辨形式化为空间变化逆问题，将退化运算符建模为伪微分运算符。通过渐流动力学实现神经网络架构，使用深度条件卷积核和动态调整的正则化项，确保收敛到理论能量函数的稳定点。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上进行全面评估，在KITTI户外场景上达到2倍和4倍缩放的36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM指标，分别超过现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。在深度变化场景上显著提升性能，同时在传统标准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了第一个理论基础坚实的距离适配性超分辨框架，通过结合深度信息和空间变化模型，有效解决了真实影像系统中的距离依赖退化问题，为超分辨领域提供了新的理论基础和实践方向。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有工作大多只关注单人或对话手势，假设身体方向和位置基本不变，无法准确捕捉日常场景中两人动态、语义一致的长期交互行为。

Method: 采集了包含241个运动序列的多模态数据集InterAct，提出分层回归身体动作的扩散方法，并设计了新颖的微调机制提高嘴唇准确性。

Conclusion: 该工作为两人交互行为建模提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，填补了长期动态交互捕捉的研究空白，推动了相关领域发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Method: 1) 将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2) 时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3) 分层识别模块通过两阶段推理（粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证）选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层推理和LLM驱动的训练免费方法，有效解决了视频对象分割中的语言-视觉对齐问题，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的预处理步骤就能调整现有形状模型，具有广泛的插件化应用潜力，为医学形态重建流水线提供了一种高效的姿态对齐解决方案。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

TL;DR: PointPillars是最快的3D物体检测器，但因伪图像表示无法保留精确3D结构且难以采用两阶段检测。本文提出第一个基于伪图像表示的两阶段3D检测框架，通过3DPillars CNN结构和稀疏场景特征模块来充分利用3D特征和场景上下文信息，在保持效率的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PointPillars的两大限制：1)伪图像表示无法保留精确的3D结构信息；2)难以采用两阶段检测流程，而两阶段方法通常性能更优。目标是缩小PointPillars与最新方法的性能差距，同时保持其高效性。

Method: 1) 3DPillars CNN结构：将3D立方体特征视为一堆伪图像，通过可分离立方体特征模块使用2D卷积高效学习3D特征，避免使用3D卷积。2) RoI头部与稀疏场景上下文特征模块：聚合3DPillars的多尺度特征获得稀疏场景特征，支持两阶段检测流程并利用场景上下文信息精炼3D物体建议。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架成功克服了PointPillars的限制，通过创新的3DPillars结构和两阶段检测流程，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了3D物体检测的性能。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文研究了位置元数据对海底图像自监督学习的提升效果，在6种SOTA SSL框架上验证了位置正则化的一致性改善作用，特别在低维隐藏表征中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过机器人采集的海底视觉图像进行高速解释可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究已经指出位置元数据可以增强自监督学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集上的好处仍然很少被探索。

Method: 评估位置基于正则化对6种最先进的SSL框架的影响，包括卷积神经网络(CNN)和Vision Transformer(ViT)模型，以及不同隐藏空间维度。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行评估。

Result: 位置正则化一致性地提高了下游分类性能，CNN和ViT的F1分数分别平均提升4.9%和6.3%。位置正则化的SSL在低维隐藏表征中对CNN的改善效果更为显著，而高维ViT模型体现了强大的沿用性能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，特别是在使用低维隐藏表征时。同时证明了高维ViT模型在海底图像分析中具有强大的沿用性能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CRAB模型，通过相机-雷达融合和反向投影技术解决深度模糊问题，在nuScenes数据集上达到62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP的SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前向投影方法存在BEV特征稀疏问题，反向投影方法存在深度模糊导致误检的问题，需要结合相机和雷达的互补特性来解决这些限制

Method: 使用反向投影方法，在视角变换过程中将透视图像特征聚合到BEV查询中，通过结合图像密集但不准确的深度分布与雷达稀疏但精确的深度信息来改善深度区分，并引入包含雷达上下文信息的空间交叉注意力机制

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现了62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP的3D目标检测性能，在基于反向投影的相机-雷达融合方法中达到最先进水平

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效融合相机和雷达信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，为BEV视角下的3D目标检测和分割提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Sam Fenton,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于代表性样本取样策略的在线聚类框架，能够在海底形势调查中实时无监督地识别和归纳常见模式，并支持动态聚类合并与分割操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时间海底居留AUV在实时情况下进行海底图像解释的需求，而传统离线分析方法需要完整数据集和人工标注，无法满足实时性要求。

Method: 设计了一种在线聚类框架(OCF)，通过识别和维护一组代表性样本来捐捕演化的特征分布，支持动态聚类合并和分割操作，无需重新处理全部图像历史。

Result: 在三个多样化海底图像数据集上评估，OCF获得了所有在线聚类方法中最高的平均F1分数(0.68)，并在三条不同调查轨迹上显示了仅3%的标准偏差，说明其聚类能力和对轨迹变化的稳健性。同时，随着数据量增加，计算时间保持一致低且有界。

Conclusion: 该框架特性有利于生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持久自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的视觉检测自动化面临小样本、不平衡数据、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发能够在这些约束条件下工作的深度异常检测方法

Method: 1. 基于结构相似性的异常评分方法(4-MS-SSIM)，轻量级实时缺陷检测；2. 基于马氏距离的特征距离方法，对潜在特征进行降维处理，用于分布偏移检测

Result: 方法1在仅有10%缺陷样本的情况下达到ACC 0.903(无监督)和0.931(有监督)；方法2达到ACC 0.722(有监督)，均优于重新实现的基线方法

Conclusion: 两种方法提供互补能力：方法1支持可靠的在线检测，方法2支持可扩展的生产后监控和监管合规监测，为在受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用途径

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Conclusion: 该系统在实验室咊真实雨林环境中都表现出艰固的深度估计、RGB重建咊材料区分能力，为轻量化、集成化的无人机感知咊数据收集提供了新方案

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

### [59] [A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809)
*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化、合理分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在的标注不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性。这在医学成像中尤其成问题，因为标注不确定性或专家间变异性可能导致多个合理分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调节提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上的评估表明，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM通过概率建模成功解决了确定性分割模型在医学图像分析中的局限性，能够有效捕捉和表达分割任务中的不确定性，为不确定性感知的医学图像分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Conclusion: 标准测试实践在低数据临床环境中存在局限性，性能排名不能反映真正的临床效用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Result: 实验结果表明BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: BTCChat通过专门设计的变化理解模块有效解决了双时相图像分析中的关键挑战，为卫星图像变化检测提供了更强大的解决方案

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，在复杂环境中可靠性不足，需要开发能够融合多模态数据的可靠评估方法。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块学习时空依赖关系，包含细粒度注意力模块(FGAM)和多模态几何对应模块(MGCM)来实现跨模态特征精炼和对齐。

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和MCC均为93%，RMSE为0.1205，MAE为0.0156，优于9个流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推动了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动医学领域提供了创新的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

<details>

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法注重像素级重建，但新兴应用更关注语义保持，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的零样本和表征能力，提出基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，压缩CLIP特征嵌入而非原始图像

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3*10^-3 bpp，仅为主流方法比特率的不到5%，在极端压缩下仍具有零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法为语义压缩提供了新范式，在极低比特率下实现跨任务和跨数据分布的语义保持，具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Result: CPS消除了噪声除病，实现更准确的奖励建模，推动Flow-GRPO等RL优化器更快更稳定收敛

Conclusion: CPS为流匹配模型的RL应用提供了更有效的采样方法，解决了SDE方法的噪声问题

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: 双向交互融合模块能够有效利用不同图像的互补信息，提高医学图像分割的准确性，尤其在边界区域表现优异

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

TL;DR: 通过神经网络方法NBL和FastNBL实现实时灵光效果，速度比现有技术提升30%，节省计算资源


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统灵光技术依赖多次模糊和素材采样导致的性能瓶颈问题

Method: 提出两种神经网络基于灵光照明方法：Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) 和 Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL)，分别优化质量和性能

Result: FastNBL比标准方法快28%，NBL快12%，在多种3D场景中都能产生高质量灵光效果

Conclusion: 神经网络方法能够在实时渲染中更快速地实现现实灵光效果，为高FPS环境提供更流畅的体验和氛围氛围

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前从2D视觉领域演化而来的3D医学形态自盛学习方法缺乏空间知识学习过程的直观表现，导致医学可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 设计了三个子任务来捐捕3D医学形态中的空间相关语义，遵循观察性原则确保可解释性，并通过多粒度空间关系建模保持训练稳定性。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够与当前方法拥有相当的性能表现，同时有助于直观理解自盛学习过程。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种可解释性强的3D医学形态自盛学习方法，有效解决了当前方法在医学可解释性方面的不足，为医学形态自盛学习领域提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniStyle2通过去风格化方法构建大规模数据集DST-100K，训练出基于FLUX.1-dev的前馈模型，在艺术风格迁移任务中超越现有最佳方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实监督数据的基本挑战，通过去风格化方法获得风格-内容对齐的真实监督信号

Method: 1) 开发DST文本引导去风格化模型重建无风格内容；2) 开发DST-Filter多阶段评估模型自动过滤低质量数据对；3) 基于DST-100K数据集训练FLUX.1-dev前馈模型

Result: OmniStyle2在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过去风格化的可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实数据的基本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

TL;DR: ConstStyle是一种新颖的域泛化方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一域来减少域偏移影响，在有限训练域和大域差距情况下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时的性能下降问题，传统方法在处理有限训练域或大域差距时效果有限

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法，利用统一域捕获域不变特征并弥合域差距。训练时将样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影后再进行预测

Result: 在多种场景下 consistently 优于现有方法，当只有有限seen domains时，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: 通过统一域对齐训练和测试数据，ConstStyle能有效减少域偏移影响，提升域泛化鲁棒性

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像处理任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但需要专门的方法来处理稀疏视图CT重建中的缺失投影视图完成和全局信息建模问题。

Method: 设计了联合训练机制和时序变化稀疏条件重加权引导策略，采用线性回归校正分布偏移，构建双网络并行架构进行全局校正和多子频段优化。

Result: 在公共和真实数据集上，PSNR提升2.58dB，SSIM提高2.37%，MSE降低0.236，重建图像在结构一致性、细节恢复和伪影抑制方面表现出优异的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STRIDE方法通过创新的条件重加权策略和双网络架构，成功实现了高质量的稀疏视图CT图像重建，在多个指标上显著优于现有最佳基线方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦策略，通过注入预计算的语义分割信息先验来指导单目3D目标检测，无需扩展检测模型或联合学习先验，在KITTI基准上对小目标检测效果显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于输入是单张2D图像，缺乏深度信息，是一个病态问题。现有方法主要使用CNN或Transformer提取特征，然后通过检测头预测3D参数，但缺乏对场景语义信息的充分利用

Method: 采用解耦策略，将预计算的语义分割信息先验直接融合到特征空间中指导检测，不扩展检测模型或联合学习先验，专注于评估额外分割信息对现有检测流程的影响

Result: 在KITTI 3D目标检测基准上表现优异，特别是在行人、自行车等小目标检测上超越了仅依赖RGB图像特征的等效架构

Conclusion: 理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，语义分割信息的注入能有效提升单目3D目标检测性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Motivation: 现有单图像定位方法没有利用宇航任务中的时序信息，需要开发能够抓取运动动态的方法来提高定位精度

Method: 通过视觉Transformer编码器提取图像特征，结合预训练光流模型的运动线索，定位2D关键点，然后使用PnP求解器恢复6自由度位姿

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上训练和评估，在SPARK-2024数据集上测试通用性，在2D关键点定位和6自由度位姿估计上都超过了单图像基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著提高了定位精度，还展示了在不同数据分布上的良好通用性，为宇航器位姿估计提供了有效的方案

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的VQA框架，通过多候选答案生成、空间定位和思维链推理来处理视觉问题中的模糊性，在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户在VQA中面临挑战：拍摄模糊照片、难以提出具体问题，导致问题模糊且存在多个有效答案，这与传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域不匹配。

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样候选答案，通过PolyFormer进行空间定位，最后应用思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域。

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中，BLaVe-CoT优于先前方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，该工作为此类研究奠定了基础并公开了代码。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV

engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的面部微表情识别方法存在两个主要问题：手工特征提取需要关键帧，而深度网络又面临训练数据小、多样性不足的挑战。需要一种能够有效抓取微表情细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题的新方法。

Method: 提出FDP框架，包含主要四个步骤：1)对原始帧序列进行帧级特征排序，编码动态信息；2)使用局部-全局特征感知变换器进行帧表征学习；3)通过排序计分器计算每个帧的排序分数；4)将排序特征在时间维度池化获取动态表征，同时用于微表情识别和动态图像构建任务。

Conclusion: FDP框架通过序列排序编码动态信息和动态图像构建任务，有效抓取了面部微表情的细微动作，同时缓解了训练数据稀缺问题，为微表情识别领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

Conclusion: 集成细节保持下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为基于无人机的小缺陷电力检测提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Conclusion: BranchGRPO通过创新的分支采样和剪枝策略，有效解决了计算成本和训练稳定性问题，为生成模型的对齐提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Motivation: 现有微调策略存在局限性：并行微调隔离任务无法利用共享知识，多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以增量集成新任务

Method: 提出MedSeqFT框架，包含两个核心组件：1) MDS选择机制识别最能代表预训练分布的下游样本；2) K&G RFT基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案，平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保留

Result: 在两个多任务数据集上的实验显示，MedSeqFT持续优于最先进的微调策略，平均Dice提升3.0%，在未见任务上表现出更好的迁移性，特别是肿瘤分割

Conclusion: MedSeqFT建立了序列微调作为适应基础模型到不断演进的临床任务的有效、知识保持的范式

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了现有视觉语言模型在病理图像分析中的局限性，为临床环境中的自动化诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

Motivation: 自动图像聚类是计算机视觉的基础，但在图像增强应用中受限，主要原因是难以定义对该任务有意义的聚类。

Method: 引入CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类；同时提出量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更适用于图像增强；利用CARDIE聚类重采样图像增强数据集可提高色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更相关的聚类方法，公开代码以促进采用和确保可复现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

<details>

Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度

Method: 基于3D移位窗口Transformer框架，采用级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，设计优化的波段序列来捕捉波段间关系，输入5个多光谱波段重建224个高光谱波段

Result: PSNR达到35.82dB，SAM为2.40度，SSIM为0.96，相比基线MHF-Net提升5.6dB PSNR，ERGAS降低一半以上

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D在光谱重建质量和下游任务（土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割）上都表现出优异性能，验证了其实际应用价值

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权的使用可能导致生物信息泄露，侵犯个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化替代年龄编码器，提供对黑盒年龄预测模型的通用防御。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物识别隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了医疗诊断价值，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also

Conclusion: 提出的UniVerse-1模型在音视频生成方面表现出色，通过Verse-Bench基准测试验证了其有效性，为研究社区提供了有价值的开源资源。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框或像素级别）设计，需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架：1）扩展slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系slot；2）对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性；3）动态三元组预测模块关联关系slot与对象对。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一框架在视频场景图生成任务中的有效性，能够最小化任务特定修改并最大化参数共享，实现跨不同视觉粒度的泛化能力。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在局限，而现实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）依赖自我中心的多视角观测，需要更好的空间推理能力评估方法。

Method: 创建包含8,600+问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并提出了Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过生成基于估计全局3D坐标的认知地图来增强空间推理能力。

Result: 基准测试显示当前SOTA VLMs与人类水平存在显著差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题问答上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在真实世界多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需改进空间理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

*Cecelia Soh,Rizhao Cai,Monalisha Paul,Dennis Sng,Alex Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过智能手机自拍图片远程估算皮肤保水度和经皮失水量，提出了一种新的皮肤优先适应视觉Transformer模型，解决了皮肤健康评估的普及性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤障碍功能的量化指标（SH和TEWL）对公众监测皮肤状况至关重要，但需要专业仪器在皮肤科诊所测量，普通用户难以获得。需要一种无需物理测量的远程皮肤评估方案。

Method: 提出了一个系统性解决方案，包括SH/TEWL数据收集、数据预处理和新的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型。识别了数据标注不平衡问题，并提出对称基对比正则化来减少模型偏差。

Result: 该研究首次实现了从自拍面部图像中远程估算SH和TEWL，无需物理测量仪器。通过对比学习正则化有效减少了数据不平衡导致的模型偏差。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究之间的空白，为AI驱动的普及化皮肤分析开启了新的可能性，有助于更广泛的实际应用。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAML是一个用于视觉定位的创新框架，通过原型感知多模态学习解决开放词汇场景中的挑战，在标准场景和开放词汇场景都取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景中定位性能良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含新颖对象类别）中存在三个主要限制：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: 提出Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML)框架，包含：使用ALBEF进行跨模态对齐、视觉判别特征编码器增强显著对象表示、新颖的原型发现和继承机制提取多邻居语义原型、多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法，在标准场景中表现有竞争力，在开放词汇场景中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性地解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，有效提升了视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

*Zhang Jing,Pu Nan,Xie Yu Xiang,Guo Yanming,Lu Qianqi,Zou Shiwei,Yan Jie,Chen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了视频领域的广义分类发现(Video-GCD)问题，设计了一种新的内存导向一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)，通过时间-空间线索和全局上下文来提高在视频中发现新类别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要关注静态图像中的分类发现，但仅靠静态视觉内容往往不能可靠地发现新类别。为了解决这个问题，需要将GCD扩展到视频领域。

Method: 提出了内存导向一致性对比学习(MCCL)框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性感知对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数，MGRE通过双级内存缓冲区提供全局上下文。

Result: 在行为识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了涉广的实验，结果显示该方法显著地超过了来自图像基础设置的竞争性GCD方法。

Conclusion: 时间信息对于在视频中发现新类别至关重要，提出的MCCL框架通过有效整合多视角信息和一致性建模，在Video-GCD任务上取得了显著成效。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在MLLM框架内文本驱动图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和泛化能力，与现有MLLM主干网络兼容

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的货币评估框架，集成面额分类、损坏量化和假币检测三个模块，适用于资源受限环境下的实时设备端推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有货币识别系统通常忽视可用性和真实性评估，特别是在低资源环境中，视觉障碍用户和离线验证很常见。现有方法主要关注面额分类，但忽略了物理损坏和伪造问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，通过新颖的统一货币损坏指数(UCDI)进行损坏量化，采用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测。数据集包含82,000多张标注图像。

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧中的目标信息中受益，但直接将目标描述文本加入提示会带来额外token长度和对目标级别信息噪声的敏感性

Method: 开发GO-Tokenizer轻量级附加模块，使用现成目标检测器实时编码紧凑目标信息，避免文本描述带来的问题

Result: 使用GO-Tokenizer预训练的模型在时间推理定位和密集描述等任务上优于原始视频大语言模型及其文本描述对应版本，增益在不同模型、数据集和任务上具有泛化性

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer通过有效编码目标信息显著提升了视频大语言模型的时间敏感视频理解能力，且具有良好的泛化性能

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的面部反欺诈方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角注意力模块(MVS)和多文本补丁对齐模块(MTPA)，利用多个释义文本来生成泛化特征。

Result: 在跨域数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法，表现出优异的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过充分利用CLIP的多文本表示和补丁嵌入，显著提升了面部反欺诈的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了一种自动化目标处理流程，用于分析脑转移癌症患者经立体定向放疗后的纵向MRI数据，通过数据驱动聚类和机器学习方法识别了5种主要的病变发展轨迹，并实现了高准确率的疗效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移癌症是导致癌症患者死亡的主要原因之一。虽然有规律的MRI随访监测，但纵向形态学图像分析工作量巨大，临床医生无法完整标注，仅靠盲估评估，需要自动化工具来提高评估精度和效率。

Method: 建立自动化数据处理流程，收集了177名患者的896个脑转移癌症的长期MRI数据（每2个月一次随访，超过360天）。采用数据驱动聚类方法识别特征性发展轨迹，并使用梯度提升和图机器学习模型预测12个月的病变响应。

Result: 聚类分析发现5种主要的病变发展轨迹，每种轨迹有明显不同的最终响应类别。梯度提升模型仅使用治疗前和第一次随访MRI数据就能达到0.90 AUC的预测准确率（CI95%=0.88-0.92）。图机器学习模型也获得0.88 AUC的稳健性能（CI95%=0.86-0.90），而且能够处理多个输入时间点配置。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了自动化目标处理流程在纵向MRI数据分析中的可行性，能够提高脑转移癌症SRS治疗响应评估的精确度和效率。该方法为研究脑转移癌症发展模式提供了可扩展的数据处理方案，为临床决策支持系统的开发奠定了基础，最终有助于优化个性化治疗方案。

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

Conclusion: 球坐标量化方案能够有效减小3D高斯拓扑在限制视角范围内的投影误差，提高了坐标表示的精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Motivation: 解决视觉-语言模型在文档理解任务中计算费用过高的问题，提高效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight是一个基于SAM和MLLM的视频伪装目标检测新方法，通过时空特征融合、动态前景视觉token评分和解耦学习策略，解决了现有方法在边缘分离和目标-背景分离方面的局限性，在MoCA-Mask数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCOD方法存在两个主要问题：(1)SAM方法由于模型冻结难以分离伪装目标边缘；(2)MLLM方法因大语言模型合并前景和背景而导致目标分离性差。需要一种能够同时解决边缘细节分离和目标-背景分离的新方法。

Method: 1.使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合提高信息密度；2.通过动态前景视觉token评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应引导和微调SAM模型；3.提出解耦的前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Result: 在MoCA-Mask数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在CAD2016数据集上展示了检测未见伪装目标的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，并引入创新的特征融合和解耦学习策略，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的关键挑战，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: 首次提出无需标注的牛只口鼻检测解决方案，为畜牧业监测提供了更易部署和适应性更强的实用替代方案

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Result: 在广泛实验中，PBAN超越了现有的最先进质量评估方法

Conclusion: PBAN通过模拟人类视觉感知机制，为超分辨率图像质量评估提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to

represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的两个关键挑战：1）模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）导致的辐射变化误判为真实变化；2）深层抽象特征与浅层细节特征之间存在语义鸿沟，阻碍有效融合，导致边界分割不清。

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频率-空间协同处理和门控融合机制，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化问题和语义鸿沟问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To

TL;DR: TIDE框架通过目标监督和偏好学习解决主体驱动图像生成中保持主体身份与遵循编辑指令之间的冲突，无需测试时微调即可实现优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在主体驱动图像生成中无法有效平衡保持主体身份和遵循动态编辑指令的问题。

Method: 提出目标监督三元组对齐方法，使用(参考图像、指令、目标图像)三元组建模主体适应动态，通过DSD目标训练模型，系统生成和评估"获胜"(平衡保持-遵循)和"失败"(失真)目标。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出色，在生成主体忠实输出的同时保持指令遵循，在多个量化指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TIDE框架成功解决了主体驱动图像生成中的关键挑战，展示了在结构条件生成、图像到图像生成和文本图像插值等多样化任务中的强大适应性。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RANO评估标准应用复杂且存在观察者变异性，需要更准确、可靠的自动化方法来评估脑细胞瘤的治疗响应，以支持临床决策和患者管理。

Method: 提出一种新的深度学习与政床神经科学特征相结合的混合框架：使用精细调整的ResNet-18模型从四种MRI模态中提取图像特征，然后与4800个政床神经科学特征融合，包括3D肿瘤增长/缩小掩码、体积变化和肿瘤质心偏移等。最后使用CatBoost分类器进行四类响应预测。

Result: 在4类响应预测任务中（完全缓解、部分缓解、病情稳定、病情进展），方法获得均值ROC AUC为0.81，Macro F1分数为0.50。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示，将学习到的图像表征与领域目标政床神经科学特征相结合，为神经科学治疗响应评估提供了稳健而有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对FairCLIP进行可复现性研究，发现原实验设计与实现不一致，新实现A-FairCLIP和FairCLIP+均未能证明FairCLIP在性能和公平性方面的改善效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可复现性，调查其通过Sinkhorn距离最小化图像-文本相似度差异来改善CLIP模型群体公平性的方法是否有效

Method: 重现Luo等人(2024)的实验设计，发现模型描述与原始实现不一致后，开发了A-FairCLIP来检验具体设计选择，并提出FairCLIP+扩展到多属性目标

Result: 在哈佛-FairVLMed数据集的零样本青光眼分类任务中，CLIP确实存在对某些人口统计特征的偏见，但实验结果不支持FairCLIP能够改善CLIP的性能和公平性，正则化目标虽然减小了Sinkhorn距离，但既无法提升性能也无法改善公平性

Conclusion: 该研究无法重现FairCLIP在两个数据集上的结果，虽然CLIP存在偏见问题，但FairCLIP的方法并未能有效解决这些问题，建议进一步研究距离最小化对模型性能和公平性的影响

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Method: 创建JSON格式的FMOX元数据文件，扩展四个开源FMO数据集的地面真实标注信息，包含物体大小信息。使用EfficientTAM基础跟踪模型进行测试，使用轨迹交并比(TIoU)评分。

Result: EfficientTAM模型在FMOX数据集上表现良好，性能与专门为FMO数据集设计的相关模型相当。

Conclusion: FMOX元数据文件为FMO数据集处理提供了可访问和可使用的标准格式，支持更多机器学习管道的开发和测试。所有代码和JSON文件都开源共享。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检索模型的架构增强，而忽视了真实世界草图中固有的模糊性和噪声问题。本文强调需要设计对草图变异性具有鲁棒性的训练目标。

Method: 采用适当的预训练策略、编码器架构和损失函数组合，明确设计对草图变异性具有鲁棒性的训练目标，不引入额外复杂度。

Result: 在具有挑战性的FS-COCO和广泛使用的SketchyCOCO数据集上进行大量实验，证实了方法的有效性，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 训练设计在跨模态检索任务中起着关键作用，同时需要改进场景级SBIR的评估场景，本文方法为处理草图模糊性和噪声提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为RARL的方法，用于解决增量开集识别(IOSR)中的边界识别性下降问题，通过角度空间对齐和虚拟类交互训练策略，在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开集识别方法多为静态场景设计，无法满足从连续数据流中增量识别新出现的未知类的需求。在这种演化场景中，由于无法访问之前的训练数据，OSR决策边界的识别能力容易下降，导致严重的类间混淆。

Method: 提出了保持性角度表征学习(RARL)方法：1)在均角紧架构建的角度空间中，鼓励未知表征向静止原型对齐；2)采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界近似虚拟类来压缩已知表征；3)设计分层校正策略，减轻表征偏差和特征空间扭曲。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了详细评估，并为IOSR领域建立了新的标杆。在各种任务设置下的实验结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RARL方法通过角度空间表征学习和虚拟-内在交互策略，有效解决了增量开集识别中的边界识别性下降问题，为演化场景下的未知类识别提供了有效觤决方案。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像向量值形态学算子方面的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的机器学习方法能够有效学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，为向量值形态学算子的构建提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

Motivation: 现有多视角扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了在3D世界建模中的应用，仅支持固定视角数量且推理速度慢。

Method: 使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，采用成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制，推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Conclusion: 自回归多视角扩散模型CausNVS成功解决了非自回归方法的局限性，为3D新视角合成提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于网络贸易监控，还可用于实体市场监测，为政府当局和执法机构提供了实用的野生动物贸易监测工具

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Method: 提出混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止过拟合噪声

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上实验表明，HSANet相比现有方法具有更优的降噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小

Conclusion: 该方法在标准内存GPU上可部署，具有很高的实际临床应用价值

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉氮素缺乏、水分强刻和杂草压力之间的复杂交互作用，为及旹预防急急识别氮素强刻提供了强大工具

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Result: 在公开和定制数据集上的实验表明，VIM-GS在大场景中具有优越的渲染质量

Conclusion: VIM-GS通过结合稀疏和密集深度信息的优势，成功解决了大场景中单目图像深度估计的挑战，实现了高质量的新视角合成

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割准确性、效率和部署性方面完胜MobileNet基准模型，适合智能闭环生物打印系统

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

TL;DR: STAGE是一种面向分割的工业异常合成方法，通过分级扩散和显式掩码对齐技术，解决了现有方法在纹理细节、背景对齐和细粒度异常生成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常合成方法存在纹理细节不足、背景对齐不精确、难以生成像素级细粒度异常等问题，需要新的解决方案来提升下游异常分割性能。

Method: 提出STAGE方法：1）引入干净背景信息作为先验指导去噪分布；2）采用分级扩散框架和异常专用分支记录局部异常；3）使用显式掩码对齐策略逐步对齐合成异常与背景。

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的大量实验表明，STAGE在工业异常合成方面达到了最先进的性能，有效提升了下游异常分割任务的表现。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略和分级扩散框架，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为下游异常分割任务提供了更高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our

Conclusion: 通过结合EfficientNetV2和注意力基础MLP-Mixer，得到了一个健壮的深度学习模型，为临床决策支持系统提供了高准确性和可解释性的脑部脾瘤分类方案。

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

TL;DR: Zo3T是一个零样本测试时训练框架，通过3D感知运动投影、轨迹引导的测试时LoRA适配器和引导场校正，实现了高质量的轨迹引导图像到视频生成，无需大量标注数据训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轨迹引导I2V生成方法需要大量计算资源进行微调，以及零样本方法在潜在空间操作时忽略3D透视导致运动不真实的问题。

Method: 采用三核心创新：3D感知运动投影推断场景深度；轨迹引导测试时LoRA动态注入适配器；引导场校正通过一步前瞻策略优化条件引导场。

Result: Zo3T显著提升了3D真实感和运动准确性，在轨迹控制的I2V生成中优于现有的基于训练和零样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过测试时训练和3D感知技术，实现了无需大量标注数据的高质量轨迹引导视频生成，为I2V生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态理解生成模型在图像生成能力上虽有显著进步，但在指令遵循和细节保持方面仍与GPT-4o等紧密耦合理解与生成的系统存在较大差距

Method: 提出Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG)框架，交替进行基于文本的思考和图像合成：首先生成文本思考来指导初始图像，然后对结果进行反思以细化细节、视觉质量和美学效果；使用IRGL-300K数据集进行两阶段训练

Conclusion: 交替推理方法能够有效提升文本到图像生成的质量和细节保持能力，实现了最先进的性能表现

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Result: 在PUMA数据集上的大量实验表明，Co-Seg在肿瘤组织和细胞核实例的语义、实例和全景分割方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Co-Seg框架通过协同分割方法有效提升了病理图像分析性能，证明了组织分割和细胞核分割任务之间的相互增强关系。

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Motivation: 视频姿态变换器(VPTs)计算成本高，难以在资源受限设备上部署，需要开发高效的3D人体姿态估计方法。

Method: 分层即插即用剪枝恢复框架H₂OT，包含Token剪枝模块(TPM)动态选择代表性token，Token恢复模块(TRM)恢复完整时空信息，支持seq2seq和seq2frame两种流程。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性和效率，仅用少量代表性帧的pose token即可实现高效率和估计精度。

Conclusion: 保持完整姿态序列是不必要的，少量代表性帧的pose token可以同时实现高效率和估计精度，该方法可轻松集成到常见VPT模型中。

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多模态黑色幽默理解问题，发布的数据集和代码将促进相关内容审核和幽默理解研究

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Motivation: 解决真实激光雷达数据采集成本高、标注困难的问题，通过数字孪生技术创建高质量合成数据集来增强现有基准数据集。

Method: 使用数字孪生技术模拟真实场景的几何结构、道路对齐和车辆运动模式，通过仿真激光雷达传感器生成合成数据，包含3D边界框、实例分割标签和语义分割标签。

Conclusion: UrbanTwin数据集是首个能够替代真实激光雷达感知任务的合成数据集，具有增强样本量和场景多样性的价值，并可定制测试场景。

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用通用基础模型通过过渡学习调整和整合手术室多模态数据来支持多任务外科数据科学应用，以提高手术预后预测和手术阶段识别的准确性。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础模型，在未标注的外科视频数据上进行完善调整，并通过模块化决策支持网络整合手术室的其他时间分辨数据流。在杂志手术视频数据集和公开HeiCo数据集上评估医院住院时长、手术后并发症预测以及手术阶段识别任务。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了通用基础模型通过域适配和多模态整合在外科数据科学中的潜力，为接下来的研究提供了代码和模型权重支持。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Conclusion: 提出的拓扑自适应方法有效解决了传统假设失效的拓扑伪影场景，为实际应用中的非刚性网格匹配提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Motivation: 自动车牌识别(ALPR)在智慧城市中具有重要作用，但高变化性带来挑战，需要深度学习技术来更有效解决。特别是当遇到模糊车牌时，检测准确率会显著下降。

Method: 采用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理，避免不必要的输入操作；结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测(LPD)，以及集成的字符分割(CS)和字符识别(CR)步骤。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Conclusion: 该模型为实时和资源有限的临床环境提供了一种实用的轻量化分割方案，平衡了性能和效率。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球面空间，在SO(4)双不变空间中用Riemannian距离近似geodesic距离，推理时使用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化

Conclusion: 非欧几里得球面特征空间的相似性学习能够提供更具表达力和几何一致性的深度相似性度量，增强区分细微姿态差异的能力

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练大规模扩散模型的鲁棒性来解决盲图像恢复问题，避免训练辅助特征提取器，降低计算复杂度。

Method: 从退化图像中通过模型本身提取特征，扩展自注意力机制引入退化特征，并采用采样引导机制减少幻觉现象。

Result: 在合成和真实退化场景下，BIR-Adapter实现了与最先进方法相当或更好的性能，同时具有显著更低的复杂度。适配器设计可集成到其他扩散模型中。

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效且通用的盲图像恢复解决方案，能够扩展超分辨率模型处理未知退化的能力，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat是首个针对小麦作物的大规模视觉基础模型，通过在ImAg4Wheat数据集（250万张高分辨率图像）上进行自监督预训练，在10个田间视觉任务中显著优于通用预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练模型在农业视觉监测中泛化能力不足，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用，需要作物特定的基础模型来提高可靠性。

Method: 使用自监督学习方法在ImAg4Wheat数据集（全球30个站点10年收集的250万张小麦图像，涵盖2000+基因型和500+环境条件）上预训练小麦专用视觉基础模型。

Result: FoMo4Wheat在冠层和器官级别的10个田间视觉任务中一致优于最先进的通用预训练模型，且表征对小麦具有鲁棒性并可迁移到其他作物和杂草。

Conclusion: 作物专用基础模型对可靠的田间感知具有重要价值，为构建具有跨物种和跨任务能力的通用作物基础模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ManipDreamer3D是一个从输入图像和文本指令生成3D感知机器人操作视频的新框架，通过3D轨迹规划和轨迹到视频扩散模型解决现有方法依赖2D轨迹导致的3D空间模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作领域面临数据稀缺的挑战，现有基于扩散模型的方法主要依赖2D轨迹，存在3D空间模糊问题，需要开发能够生成具有合理3D轨迹的机器人操作视频的方法。

Method: 首先从输入图像重建3D占用表示，然后计算优化的3D末端执行器轨迹（最小化路径长度并避免碰撞），接着使用潜在编辑技术从初始图像潜在和优化轨迹创建视频序列，通过专门训练的轨迹到视频扩散模型生成拾取放置视频。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，该方法在视觉质量上表现更优，能够生成具有自主规划合理3D轨迹的机器人视频，显著减少了人工干预需求。

Conclusion: ManipDreamer3D框架成功解决了3D空间模糊问题，通过结合3D轨迹规划和扩散模型，为机器人操作视频生成提供了有效的解决方案，在减少人工干预的同时提高了生成视频的质量。

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 当前研究仅在合成或手动驾驶数据集中评估LLMs，缺乏真实边缘案例的测试，需要在自主驾驶车已失败的真实场景中评估LLMs作为异常检测器的性能。

Method: 构建了一种开放词汇目标检测器搭配提示工程和大语言模型上下文推理的架构，在真实世界边缘案例上对多个独立模型进行评测。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLMs在自主驾驶汽车中作为异常检测器的潜力应用提供了评估和讨论，帮助推动该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Motivation: 探索利用大型语言模型作为混合接口，通过自然语言协议连接生物和人工系统，创造具有自主响应环境能力的具身自适应智能体

Method: 采用异步运行的LLM模块网络（感知、视觉、对话、行动模块），通过自然语言通信将多模态数据转换为协调系统行为的语言消息

Result: 成功实现了植物状态到机器人动作的转换，在感知-运动循环中建立了规范性，使系统能够自主响应环境条件

Conclusion: 这种方法为人工生命提供了新模型，通过去中心化的LLM模块协调实现了生物与人工系统之间的新颖交互可能性

Abstract: We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and
artificial systems.

Conclusion: 隐式神经场为多轴3D打印提供了统一、可扩展的计算框架，实现了高效的全局碰撞处理和工具路径优化

Abstract: We introduce a general, scalable computational framework for multi-axis 3D
printing based on implicit neural fields (INFs) that unifies all stages of
toolpath generation and global collision-free motion planning. In our pipeline,
input models are represented as signed distance fields, with fabrication
objectives such as support-free printing, surface finish quality, and extrusion
control being directly encoded in the optimization of an implicit guidance
field. This unified approach enables toolpath optimization across both surface
and interior domains, allowing shell and infill paths to be generated via
implicit field interpolation. The printing sequence and multi-axis motion are
then jointly optimized over a continuous quaternion field. Our continuous
formulation constructs the evolving printing object as a time-varying SDF,
supporting differentiable global collision handling throughout INF-based motion
planning. Compared to explicit-representation-based methods, INF-3DP achieves
up to two orders of magnitude speedup and significantly reduces
waypoint-to-surface error. We validate our framework on diverse, complex models
and demonstrate its efficiency with physical fabrication experiments using a
robot-assisted multi-axis system.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous drone swarms in disaster response missions
necessitates the development of flexible, scalable, and robust coordination
systems. Traditional fixed architectures struggle to cope with dynamic and
unpredictable environments, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption and
connectivity. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptive
architecture for drone swarms, leveraging a Large Language Model to dynamically
select the optimal architecture as centralized, hierarchical, or holonic based
on real time mission parameters such as task complexity, swarm size, and
communication stability. Our system addresses the challenges of scalability,
adaptability, and robustness,ensuring efficient energy consumption and
maintaining connectivity under varying conditions. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our adaptive architecture outperforms traditional static
models in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity. These
results highlight the potential of our approach to provide a scalable,
adaptable, and resilient solution for real world disaster response scenarios.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for

Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous

stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Conclusion: 该方法为多机器人协调提供了高速、可扩展的解决方案，为故障容锐规划和在线感知重新规划开启了新可能

Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple
robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although
individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,
scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain
computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.
Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and
experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive
process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an
obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a
shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our
approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on
procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot
configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of
scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning
to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems
of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly
generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen
settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We
further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its
use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and
scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as
fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid
adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.

Motivation: 现有触觉接口系统通常只能渲染几何特征或机械属性中的一种，难以在可穿戴形态下同时实现多种物理属性的调制，这限制了人机交互的丰富性。

Conclusion: 对抗性气动原理为下一代触觉接口提供了可行路径，能够在实用可穿戴约束下实现多维度渲染特性。

Abstract: Haptic interfaces that can simultaneously modulate multiple physical
properties remain a fundamental challenge in human-robot interaction. Existing
systems typically allow the rendering of either geometric features or
mechanical properties, but rarely both, within wearable form factors. Here, we
introduce HapMorph, a pneumatic framework that enables continuous, simultaneous
modulation of object size and stiffness through antagonistic fabric-based
pneumatic actuators (AFPAs). We implemented a HapMorph protoytpe designed for
hands interaction achieving size variation from 50 to 104 mm, stiffness
modulation up to 4.7 N/mm and mass of the wearable parts of just 21 g. Through
systematic characterization, we demonstrate decoupled control of size and
stiffness properties via dual-chamber pressure regulation. Human perception
studies with 10 participants reveal that users can distinguish nine discrete
states across three size categories and three stiffness levels with 89.4%
accuracy and 6.7 s average response time. We further demonstrate extended
architectures that combine AFPAs with complementary pneumatic structures to
enable shape or geometry morphing with concurrent stiffness control. Our
results establish antagonistic pneumatic principle as a pathway toward
next-generation haptic interfaces, capable of multi-dimensiona rendering
properties within practical wearable constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

Conclusion: 这些结果推进了微米机器人在血管环境中的自主导航和目标药物递送技术的发展。

Abstract: Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based locomotion system for Cosmo, a
custom-built humanoid robot designed for entertainment applications. Unlike
traditional humanoids, entertainment robots present unique challenges due to
aesthetic-driven design choices. Cosmo embodies these with a disproportionately
large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that
considerably restrict movement. To address these challenges, we apply
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking
movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain
randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe
sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our
experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking
behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints.
These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic
appeal with functional performance, suggesting that learning-based methods can
effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints.

Abstract: Detecting and localizing glass in 3D environments poses significant
challenges for visual perception systems, as the optical properties of glass
often hinder conventional sensors from accurately distinguishing glass
surfaces. The lack of real-world datasets focused on glass objects further
impedes progress in this field. To address this issue, we introduce a new
dataset featuring a wide range of glass configurations with precise 3D
annotations, collected from distinct real-world scenarios. On the basis of this
dataset, we propose MonoGlass3D, a novel approach tailored for monocular 3D
glass detection across diverse environments. To overcome the challenges posed
by the ambiguous appearance and context diversity of glass, we propose an
adaptive feature fusion module that empowers the network to effectively capture
contextual information in varying conditions. Additionally, to exploit the
distinct planar geometry of glass surfaces, we present a plane regression
pipeline, which enables seamless integration of geometric properties within our
framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both glass segmentation and monocular glass
depth estimation. Our results highlight the advantages of combining geometric
and contextual cues for transparent surface understanding.

Motivation: 远程体验机器人导航效率低下和操作不直观的挑战，需要开发更高效易用的控制方法

Method: 开发并评估共享控制方法（机器人自主导航且允许用户影响路径生成），与控制切换方法（用户切换直控和自动控制）进行对比

Result: 两次用户研究（各n=20）显示共享控制方法不会降低导航效率，但也未显示减轻任务负荷的显著效果

Conclusion: 共享控制在保持导航效率方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究用户偏好和性能的关键影响因素

Abstract: Telepresence robots enable users to interact with remote environments, but
efficient and intuitive navigation remains a challenge. In this work, we
developed and evaluated a shared control method, in which the robot navigates
autonomously while allowing users to affect the path generation to better suit
their needs. We compared this with control switching, where users toggle
between direct and automated control. We hypothesized that shared control would
maintain efficiency comparable to control switching while potentially reducing
user workload. The results of two consecutive user studies (each with final
sample of n=20) showed that shared control does not degrade navigation
efficiency, but did not show a significant reduction in task load compared to
control switching. Further research is needed to explore the underlying factors
that influence user preference and performance in these control systems.

Result: 在1000个采样点配置下，路径长度比PRM缩短42.3%；在3000个高密度采样下，路径长度减少0.94%，计算时间增长仅为PRM的1/10。

Conclusion: A-star PRM在路径质量、稳定性和计算效率方面具有综合优势，特别适用于狭窄通道和动态障碍物场景。

Abstract: Robot path planning is a fundamental challenge in enhancing the environmental
adaptability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper presents a hybrid
path planning algorithm, A-star PRM, which incorporates dynamic weights. By
embedding the Manhattan distance heuristic of the A-star algorithm into the
random sampling process of PRM, the algorithm achieves a balanced optimization
of path quality and computational efficiency. The approach uses a hierarchical
sampling strategy and a dynamic connection mechanism, greatly improving
adaptability to complex obstacle distributions. Experiments show that under a
baseline configuration with one thousand sampled vertices, the path length of
A-star PRM is 1073.23 plus or minus 14.8 meters and is 42.3 percent shorter
than that of PRM with p value less than 0.01. With high-density sampling using
three thousand vertices, the path length is reduced by 0.94 percent, 1036.61
meters compared with 1046.42 meters, while the increase in computational time
is cut to about one tenth of the PRM increase, 71 percent compared with 785
percent. These results confirm the comprehensive advantages of A-star PRM in
path quality, stability, and computational efficiency. Compared with existing
hybrid algorithms, the proposed method shows clear benefits, especially in
narrow channels and scenarios with dynamic obstacles.

Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is a foundational technique for autonomous
systems, yet its deployment on resource-constrained platforms remains
challenging due to computational and memory limitations. We propose Super-LIO,
a robust LIO system that demands both high performance and accuracy, ideal for
applications such as aerial robots and mobile autonomous systems. At the core
of Super-LIO is a compact octo-voxel-based map structure, termed OctVox, that
limits each voxel to eight fused subvoxels, enabling strict point density
control and incremental denoising during map updates. This design enables a
simple yet efficient and accurate map structure, which can be easily integrated
into existing LIO frameworks. Additionally, Super-LIO designs a
heuristic-guided KNN strategy (HKNN) that accelerates the correspondence search
by leveraging spatial locality, further reducing runtime overhead. We evaluated
the proposed system using four publicly available datasets and several
self-collected datasets, totaling more than 30 sequences. Extensive testing on
both X86 and ARM platforms confirms that Super-LIO offers superior efficiency
and robustness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Super-LIO processes
each frame approximately 73% faster than SOTA, while consuming less CPU
resources. The system is fully open-source and plug-and-play compatible with a
wide range of LiDAR sensors and platforms. The implementation is available at:

Abstract: Game-based interactive driving simulations have emerged as versatile
platforms for advancing decision-making algorithms in road transport mobility.
While these environments offer safe, scalable, and engaging settings for
testing driving strategies, ensuring both realism and robust performance amid
dynamic and diverse scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently, the
integration of game-based techniques with advanced learning frameworks has
enabled the development of adaptive decision-making models that effectively
manage the complexities inherent in varied driving conditions. These models
outperform traditional simulation methods, especially when addressing
scenario-specific challenges, ranging from obstacle avoidance on highways and
precise maneuvering during on-ramp merging to navigation in roundabouts,
unsignalized intersections, and even the high-speed demands of autonomous
racing. Despite numerous innovations in game-based interactive driving, a
systematic review comparing these approaches across different scenarios is
still missing. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of game-based
interactive driving methods by summarizing recent advancements and inherent
roadway features in each scenario. Furthermore, the reviewed algorithms are
critically assessed based on their adaptation of the standard game model and an
analysis of their specific mechanisms to understand their impact on
decision-making performance. Finally, the survey discusses the limitations of
current approaches and outlines promising directions for future research.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

ZLATTE achieves smoother, safer, and more interpretable trajectory
modifications compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the rapid development of the warehousing and logistics industries, the
packing of goods has gradually attracted the attention of academia and
industry. The packing of footwear products is a typical representative
paired-item packing task involving irregular shapes and deformable objects.
Although studies on shoe packing have been conducted, different initial states
due to the irregular shapes of shoes and standard packing placement poses have
not been considered. This study proposes a robotic manipulation framework,
including a perception module, reorientation planners, and a packing planner,
that can complete the packing of pairs of shoes in any initial state. First, to
adapt to the large intraclass variations due to the state, shape, and
deformation of the shoe, we propose a vision module based on semantic
keypoints, which can also infer more information such as size, state, pose, and
manipulation points by combining geometric features. Subsequently, we not only
proposed primitive-based reorientation methods for different states of a single
deformable shoe but also proposed a fast reorientation method for the top state
using box edge contact and gravity, which further improved the efficiency of
reorientation. Finally, based on the perception module and reorientation
methods, we propose a task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state
to provide an optimal packing strategy. Real-world experiments were conducted
to verify the robustness of the reorientation methods and the effectiveness of
the packing strategy for various types of shoes. In this study, we highlight
the potential of semantic keypoint representation methods, introduce new
perspectives on the reorientation of 3D deformable objects and multi-object
manipulation, and provide a reference for paired object packing.

Conclusion: PCPD方法显著减少了搜索过程中的分支因子，提高了整体性能，为解决考虑负载变化的能量高效路径规划问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate on battery power, making energy
efficiency a critical consideration, particularly in outdoor environments where
terrain variations affect energy consumption. While prior research has
primarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a
destination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot
needs to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact
energy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the
Object-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses
energy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one
of many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,
we first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a
variant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit
each pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from
high computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To
mitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages
multiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to
our solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of
the Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We
demonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,
improving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce
slightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of
magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.

Result: 在复杂环境中显著提升了4WIS机器人的规划性能，实现了多种转向模式的无缝集成

Conclusion: 该方法充分发挥4WIS系统的多模态优势，为空间受限环境中的机动性提供了更高的灵活性和适应性

Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a
rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and
parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained
environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single
kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of
4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A*
framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both
spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal
Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each
motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for
mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with
intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different
steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of
multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving
flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate
significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex
environments.

Conclusion: 该混合TDMA/CSMA协议有效解决了高负载机器人通信中的使命关键命令传输问题，显著提升了控制系统的性能和稳定性，且与现有IEEE 802.11标准兼容。

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control
in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems,
where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous
robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these
scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained
communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines,
otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In
this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted
in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic
loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time
arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an
IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's
deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot
traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical
command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic
integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for
establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic
TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV
protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from
interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot
Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces
missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed
robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS)
trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while
maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Conclusion: Grasp-MPC通过结合学习价值函数和MPC框架，为杂乱环境中新颖物体的鲁棒和反应式抓取提供了一条有效路径，显著提高了抓取性能。

Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,
transformer policy, and IQL approaches. Videos and more at

Motivation: 现有工作主要关注单物体功能预测，但真实世界的交互通常涉及物体对之间的关系，且面临数据有限的问题。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的语义特征和点云几何表示进行单样本学习，并将3D功能表示与大语言模型集成用于机器人操作任务生成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了有限数据下的物体间功能关系学习问题，为机器人操作提供了更强大的物体交互理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在几何退化或狭窄环境中，LiDAR点云配准问题变得病态，导致解不稳定和精度下降。现有方法未能准确检测、解释和解决这种病态性

Method: 1) 使用Schur补分解Hessian矩阵，将配准问题解耦为干净的旋转和平移子空间；2) 在子空间中建立数学特征空间与物理运动方向的显式映射；3) 设计选择性预处理策略，仅稳定病态方向

Conclusion: DCReg提供了一个系统性的框架来处理病态配准问题，通过数学分解和物理解释的结合，实现了更鲁棒和高效的LiDAR点云配准

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception and
navigation. However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments,
registration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and
degraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues,
they fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and
resolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted
solutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that
systematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through
three integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning
detection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.
This technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and
translational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy
patterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we
develop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit
mappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions,
providing actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints.
Finally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation
strategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the
identified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained
information in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization
via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical
interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at
least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup
over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation
will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg.

TL;DR: 通过在PPO控制器中添加预测模型生成的合成数据，提高四足机器人行走控制的样本效率，减少对模拟步长的需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL基于的行走控制器数据效率低，需要大量交互才能获得稳健性能

Method: 采用模型基伯强化学习(MBRL)框架，在PPO控制器中添加预测模型生成的短期合成过渡数据，按策略迭代次数逐渐集成

Result: 在Unitree Go1机器人上验证，用合成步长替换部分模拟步长不仅模拟了更长的滚动，还提高了策略回报和降低方差

Conclusion: 该方法能够使用更少的模拟步长来跟踪广泛的行走命令，显著提高了样本效率

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

Abstract: Legged robots must achieve both robust locomotion and energy efficiency to be
practical in real-world environments. Yet controllers trained in simulation
often fail to transfer reliably, and most existing approaches neglect
actuator-specific energy losses or depend on complex, hand-tuned reward
formulations. We propose a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement
learning with a physics-grounded energy model for permanent magnet synchronous
motors. The framework requires a minimal parameter set to capture the
simulation-to-reality gap and employs a compact four-term reward with a
first-principle-based energetic loss formulation that balances electrical and
mechanical dissipation. We evaluate and validate the approach through a
bottom-up dynamic parameter identification study, spanning actuators,
full-robot in-air trajectories and on-ground locomotion. The framework is
tested on three primary platforms and deployed on ten additional robots,
demonstrating reliable policy transfer without randomization of dynamic
parameters. Our method improves energetic efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 32 percent reduction in the full Cost of Transport of
ANYmal (value 1.27). All code, models, and datasets will be released.

Motivation: 传统模型方法过于保守或计算量大，学习型方法需要大量数据且可解释性差，静态风险势场无法适应动态交通条件，需要一种轻量级但能动态适应的方法

Method: 使用风险椭圆构造结合纵向可达性和横向不确定性，定义基于TTC和TWH的自适应进化因子，通过sigmoid归一化动态调整椭圆轴尺寸，并集成到MPC框架中

Result: 实验表明ERPF-MPC方法能实现更平滑的轨迹、更高的平均速度和无碰撞导航，在复杂交互驾驶环境中表现稳健

Conclusion: ERPF方法为复杂交互驾驶环境提供了鲁棒且自适应的解决方案，有效克服了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: In recent years, ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in interactive
autonomous driving has become a critical challenge. Traditional model-based
techniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly
conservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based
approaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit
limited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk
Potential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data
demands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic
traffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary
Risk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk
assessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data.
We introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and
lateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope.
Additionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through
sigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard
(TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real
time. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively
address complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of
surrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that
our ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher
average speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive
solution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPC虽然通过约束确保安全，但实时执行可能超出嵌入式计算预算，需要一种既能保持安全性又能大幅降低计算复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 提出BAN-MPC框架：1）用控制屏障函数(CBF)替代欧氏距离进行碰撞避免；2）将离线学习神经价值函数集成到短时域MPC优化目标；3）使用第二个神经网络学习价值函数对系统参数的敏感性，实现参数变化时的自适应调整。

Result: Jetson Nano上的硬件在环实验显示：BAN-MPC比传统MPC快200倍，在模型参数变化15%内实现无碰撞导航，控制误差低于5%。

Conclusion: BAN-MPC是一种有效的嵌入式MPC替代方案，无需重新训练即可适应参数变化，显著降低了离线计算成本和在线计算复杂度。

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) enforces safety via constraints, its
real-time execution can exceed embedded compute budgets. We propose a
Barrier-integrated Adaptive Neural Model Predictive Control (BAN-MPC) framework
that synergizes neural networks' fast computation with MPC's
constraint-handling capability. To ensure strict safety, we replace traditional
Euclidean distance with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for collision
avoidance. We integrate an offline-learned neural value function into the
optimization objective of a Short-horizon MPC, substantially reducing online
computational complexity. Additionally, we use a second neural network to learn
the sensitivity of the value function to system parameters, and adaptively
adjust the neural value function based on this neural sensitivity when model
parameters change, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing offline
computation costs. The hardware in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on Jetson Nano
show that BAN-MPC solves 200 times faster than traditional MPC, enabling
collision-free navigation with control error below 5\% under model parameter
variations within 15\%, making it an effective embedded MPC alternative.

Abstract: Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in
unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding
of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this
challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site
from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation
systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the
high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances.
In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in
unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient
GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and
existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed
solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its
performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The
results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more
accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation
efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly
integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances,
enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of granular media, such as sand, is crucial for
applications in construction, excavation, and additive manufacturing. However,
shaping granular materials presents unique challenges due to their
high-dimensional configuration space and complex dynamics, where traditional
rule-based approaches struggle without extensive engineering efforts.
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling agents
to learn adaptive manipulation strategies through trial and error. In this
work, we present an RL framework that enables a robotic arm with a cubic
end-effector and a stereo camera to shape granular media into desired target
structures. We show the importance of compact observations and concise reward
formulations for the large configuration space, validating our design choices
with an ablation study. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach for the training of visual policies that manipulate granular
media including their real-world deployment, outperforming two baseline
approaches.

Conclusion: ED-CBBA算法有效解决了多机器人系统中的通信挑战，在保持任务分配性能的同时显著降低了通信开销

Abstract: In various scenarios such as multi-drone surveillance and search-and-rescue
operations, deploying multiple robots is essential to accomplish multiple tasks
at once. Due to the limited communication range of these vehicles, a
decentralised task allocation algorithm is crucial for effective task
distribution among robots. The consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) has been
promising for multi-robot operation, offering theoretical guarantees. However,
CBBA demands continuous communication, leading to potential congestion and
packet loss that can hinder performance. In this study, we introduce an
event-driven communication mechanism designed to address these communication
challenges while maintaining the convergence and performance bounds of CBBA. We
demonstrate theoretically that the solution quality matches that of CBBA and
validate the approach with Monte-Carlo simulations across varying targets,
agents, and bundles. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm (ED-CBBA) can
reduce message transmissions by up to 52%.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-user VR co-location framework that synchronizes users

combines a motion capture system with SLAM-based inside-out tracking to deliver
smooth, high-framerate, low-latency performance. Previous methods either rely
on continuous external tracking, which introduces latency and jitter, or on
one-time calibration, which cannot correct drift over time. In contrast, our
approach combines the responsiveness of local HMD SLAM tracking with the
flexibility to realign to an external source when needed. It also supports
real-time pose sharing across devices, ensuring consistent spatial alignment
and engagement between users. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework
achieves the spatial accuracy required for natural multi-user interaction while

Abstract: Accurate odometry is a critical component in a robotic navigation stack, and
subsequent modules such as planning and control often rely on an estimate of
the robot's motion. Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across
sensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state
LiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on
handheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we
propose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on
sensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial
measurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a
Kalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with
LiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We
propose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model
for IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map
approach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR
registration, improving the overall odometry performance. We detail extensive
experiments on a number of datasets covering a wide array of commonly used
robotic sensors and platforms. We show that our approach works with the exact
same configuration in all these scenarios, demonstrating its robustness. We
have open-sourced our implementation so that the community can build further on
our work and use it in their navigation stacks.

Abstract: We present LiHRA, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the development of
automated, learning-based, or classical risk monitoring (RM) methods for
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. The growing prevalence of
collaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for
reliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that
capture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous
events, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a
comprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body
keypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic
context of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for
precise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental
conditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks. The LiHRA dataset
covers six representative HRI scenarios involving collaborative and coexistent
tasks, object handovers, and surface polishing, with safe and hazardous
versions of each scenario. In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point
clouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and
benchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate
LiHRA's utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in
each scenario over time. This method leverages contextual information,
including robot states and the dynamic model of the robot. With its combination
of high-resolution LiDAR data, precise human tracking, robot state data, and
realistic collision events, LiHRA offers an essential foundation for future
research into real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot
workspaces.

Abstract: Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide

Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and
precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively

Method: 集成UAV进行障碍检测和地形评估，使用权重有向图模型化环境，结合Voronoi分区、适应性边权重分配和成本优化路径规划

Result: 模拟结果表明方法能够提高路径规划效果、降低遍历成本、在动态障碍和泥浆地形中保持稳健覆盖

Conclusion: 该方法为动态农业环境中的自主覆盖控制提供了有效解决方案，具有强大的实际应用潜力

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive coverage control method for a fleet of
off-road and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in dynamic
(time-varying) agricultural environments. Traditional coverage control
approaches often assume static conditions, making them unsuitable for
real-world farming scenarios where obstacles, such as moving machinery and
uneven terrains, create continuous challenges. To address this, we propose a
real-time path planning framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) for obstacle detection and terrain assessment, allowing UGVs to
dynamically adjust their coverage paths. The environment is modeled as a
weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are continuously updated based
on the UAV observations to reflect obstacle motion and terrain variations. The
proposed approach incorporates Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weight
assignment, and cost-based path optimization to enhance navigation efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
improving path planning, reducing traversal costs, and maintaining robust
coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内河水域航行面临窄窄水道、高交通密度和流体动力干扰等挑战，现有自主航行方法缺乏够的稳健性和精度

Method: 采用稳健模型预测控制(RMPC)结合控制障碍函数(CBFs)，将水道边界和障碍物作为安全约束整合到控制框架中

Result: 模拟结果证明该方法能够在实际条件下安全导航自动表面船艇，在安全性和适应性方面显著优于现有最佳方法

Conclusion: 提出的RMPC-CBF结合方法为内河自主航行提供了一种稳健、安全的解决方案，有助于减少道路交通担塞和排放

Abstract: Deploying self-navigating surface vessels in inland waterways offers a
sustainable alternative to reduce road traffic congestion and emissions.
However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including
narrow channels, higher traffic density, and hydrodynamic disturbances.
Existing methods for autonomous vessel navigation often lack the robustness or
precision required for such environments. This paper presents a new motion
planning approach for Automated Surface Vessels (ASVs) using Robust Model
Predictive Control (RMPC) combined with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). By
incorporating channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints within the
control design framework, the proposed method ensures both collision avoidance
and robust navigation on complex waterways. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed method in safely guiding ASVs under realistic
conditions, highlighting its improved safety and adaptability compared to the
state-of-the-art.

The proposed system enables robots to perceive, interpret, report, and if

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型控制器（如扩散策略和视觉语言动作模型）通常产生低频或不连续的机器人状态变化，需要底层控制器来实现平滑的参考跟踪和合规接触行为

Abstract: Learning-based controllers, such as diffusion policies and vision-language
action models, often generate low-frequency or discontinuous robot state
changes. Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller
that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling
compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight
C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the
ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level
learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are
compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through
our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for
recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level
learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The
system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in
simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid
integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation
provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering
the barrier to applying learning-based methods on ROS2-compatible manipulators.

Abstract: Micro Autonomous Surface Vehicles (MicroASVs) offer significant potential for
operations in confined or shallow waters and swarm robotics applications.
However, achieving precise and robust control at such small scales remains
highly challenging, mainly due to the complexity of modeling nonlinear
hydrodynamic forces and the increased sensitivity to self-motion effects and
environmental disturbances, including waves and boundary effects in confined
spaces. This paper presents a physics-driven dynamics model for an
over-actuated MicroASV and introduces a data-driven optimal control framework
that leverages a weak formulation-based online model learning method. Our
approach continuously refines the physics-driven model in real time, enabling
adaptive control that adjusts to changing system parameters. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances trajectory tracking
accuracy and robustness, even under unknown payloads and external disturbances.
These findings highlight the potential of data-driven online learning-based
optimal control to improve MicroASV performance, paving the way for more
reliable and precise autonomous surface vehicle operations.

Motivation: 随着自回归视觉语言模型(VLMs)的快速发展，视觉-语言-动作模型(VLA)在机器人操作中受到关注。最近掩码扩散模型在文本生成和多模态应用中展现出竞争力，但将其用于机器人策略学习仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出LLaDA-VLA模型，采用两种关键设计：(1)局部特殊标记分类策略，用特殊动作标记分类替代全词汇分类，降低适应难度；(2)分层动作结构解码策略，考虑动作内部和跨动作的依赖关系进行分层解码。

Conclusion: LLaDA-VLA成功将扩散视觉语言模型应用于机器人操作领域，通过创新的适应策略实现了优异的性能表现，为扩散模型在机器人策略学习中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

TL;DR: F1是一个预训练的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过集成视觉预见生成到决策流程中，解决了动态视觉环境中语言条件任务的执行问题，显著提升了任务成功率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型主要采用反应式的状态到动作映射，在动态场景中容易产生短视行为且鲁棒性差。需要一种能够进行视觉预见的方法来改善决策质量。

Method: 采用混合Transformer架构，包含感知、预见生成和控制三个专用模块。核心是使用下一尺度预测机制合成目标条件的视觉预见作为明确的规划目标，将动作生成重新表述为预见引导的逆动力学问题。通过包含33万条轨迹的广泛数据集进行三阶段训练。

Conclusion: F1框架通过集成视觉预见生成，成功解决了动态环境中语言条件任务的执行挑战，证明了预见引导的决策方法在复杂动态环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了Deep Reactive Policy (DRP)，一种基于视觉-运动神经运动策略的方法，用于在动态环境中生成反应式运动，直接处理点云传感器输入，在复杂动态场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态、部分可观测环境中生成无碰撞运动的挑战。传统运动规划器需要完整环境知识且速度慢，神经运动策略虽然能从原始传感器输入直接操作，但在复杂动态环境中泛化能力不足。

Method: 核心是IMPACT，基于Transformer的神经运动策略，在1000万条生成专家轨迹上预训练。通过迭代师生微调改进静态障碍物避让，使用DCP-RMP模块增强动态障碍物避让能力。

Result: 在包含杂乱场景、动态移动障碍物和目标遮挡的挑战性任务中评估，DRP在仿真和真实世界环境中都取得了较高的成功率，优于先前的经典和神经方法。

Conclusion: DRP方法在动态环境中表现出强大的泛化能力，为机器人操作器在复杂动态场景中的运动生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

TL;DR: LocoMamba是一个基于选择性状态空间模型(Mamba)的视觉驱动跨模态深度强化学习框架，能够实现近线性时间序列建模，有效捕获长距离依赖关系，并在具有挑战性的模拟环境中表现出优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法在长序列建模中的计算效率问题，同时提升机器人导航在复杂环境中的泛化能力和训练效率。

Method: 1. 使用多层感知机嵌入本体感知状态，轻量级CNN处理深度图像生成紧凑token；2. 堆叠Mamba层通过选择性扫描融合token，实现近线性时间建模；3. 使用PPO算法在随机化地形和外观下进行端到端训练，采用障碍物密度课程学习和紧凑状态中心奖励函数。

Result: 在具有静态/动态障碍物和不平地形的模拟环境中，相比最先进基线方法，LocoMamba获得更高回报和成功率，碰撞更少，对未见地形和障碍物密度具有更强泛化能力，在相同计算预算下以更少更新次数收敛。

Conclusion: LocoMamba框架通过选择性状态空间模型实现了高效的序列建模，在机器人导航任务中展现出卓越的性能、泛化能力和训练效率，为视觉驱动的跨模态强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统性评估了LLM反学习领域的常见实践，发现依赖单一邻近集和标准采样方法存在问题，并提出了包含多样化邻近集和模块化实体级反学习策略的最佳实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM反学习研究中常见使用单一邻近集和标准采样方法，这些方法的效果和稳定性未经过严格评估，且无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性和关系。

Method: 通过系统性评估常见实践，分析了单一邻近集和不同采样方法的效果，并提出了模块化实体级反学习(MELU)策略来替代周期性采样。

Result: 研究发现依赖单一邻近集是次优的，标准1:1采样方法效率低且结果差，而提出的MELU策略结合健壮算法能够提供明确稳定的反学习路径。

Conclusion: 建议采用多样化邻近集来平衡反学习效果和模型效用，避免使用标准采样方法，并以模块化实体级反学习策略作为替代方案。

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的正则化方法，通过在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离来保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时引入一致性正则化来增强扰动样本的预测稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒微调方法主要通过保留预训练权重、特征或logits来保持OOD鲁棒性，但这些方法不能总是改善不同模型架构的OOD鲁棒性，因为它们无法很好地代理函数空间中的优化。

Method: 提出在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型距离的正则化方法，使用模拟OOD样本；同时引入一致性正则化来促进扰动样本的稳定预测。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在各种CLIP骨干网络上都能一致地改善下游任务的ID微调性能和OOD鲁棒性，优于现有的基于正则化的鲁棒微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中直接约束模型距离并引入一致性正则化，能够有效保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时获得良好的下游任务性能。

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络(GNNs)中的拓扑隐私风险，提出了拓扑推断攻击(TIAs)并发现现有边缘级隐私保护机制不足，进而提出了新型防御框架PGR来保护拓扑隐私同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在图形数据学习方面表现出强大能力，但其广泛应用引发了严重的隐私问题。以往研究主要关注边缘级隐私，而拓扑隐私（图形整体结构的保密性）这一关键威胁尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了拓扑推断攻击(TIAs)来重建目标训练图的结构，仅需黑盒访问GNN模型。为应对此挑战，开发了Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR)防御框架，采用双层优化问题形式，通过元梯度迭代生成合成训练图，并基于演化图同时更新GNN模型。

Result: 研究发现GNNs对这些攻击高度脆弱，现有边缘级差分隐私机制要么无法缓解风险，要么严重损害模型精度。PGR框架显著减少了拓扑泄漏，同时对模型精度影响最小。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了GNNs在拓扑隐私方面的重要漏洞，提出的PGR框架为保护图形结构隐私提供了有效解决方案，在保持模型性能的同时增强了隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at
https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.

Motivation: 现有研究表明MIAs对大型语言模型效果仅略优于随机猜测，认为现代预训练方法可能免于隐私泄露风险。本文旨在探索通过分析模型内部表征来发现潜在成员推断信号

Method: memTrace框架追踪"神经痕迹"，从transformer隐藏状态和注意力模式中提取信息信号，分析层级表征动态、注意力分布特征和跨层转换模式

Result: 在多个模型家族中实现了强大的成员检测能力，在流行MIA基准测试中平均AUC分数达到0.85

Conclusion: 即使基于输出的信号看似受到保护，内部模型行为仍能揭示训练数据暴露的方面，强调需要进一步研究成员隐私和开发更强大的隐私保护训练技术

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

TL;DR: Spotify提出基于上下文多臂老虎机的校准方法，动态学习用户在不同情境下的最优内容类型分布，解决音乐内容历史数据倾斜问题，提升用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spotify首页包含多种内容类型（音乐、播客、有声书），但历史数据严重偏向音乐内容，难以提供平衡且个性化的内容组合。用户对不同内容类型的偏好会随时间、星期和设备等情境因素变化。

Method: 提出基于上下文多臂老虎机的校准方法，动态学习每个用户在特定情境下的最优内容类型分布，而不是依赖历史平均值。

Result: 离线和在线实验结果都显示，该方法提高了Spotify首页的推荐精度和用户参与度，特别是在播客等代表性不足的内容类型上表现显著改善。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的校准方法能够有效适应用户兴趣在不同情境下的变化，提升内容推荐的平衡性和个性化效果，特别有利于改善非音乐内容的推荐表现。

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,

*Jia Wang,Xiao Wang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLanTS是一个周期性感知的自监督学习框架，通过多粒度分块机制和状态转换预测任务，有效解决了多元时间序列的高维性、标签稀缺和非平稳性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列在医疗、气候科学等领域普遍存在，但传统方法面临高维性、标签稀缺和非平稳性挑战。现有自监督学习方法忽略了内在周期性结构，无法捕捉潜在状态的动态演化

Method: 设计了周期感知的多粒度分块机制和广义对比损失，保持多时间分辨率下的实例级和状态级相似性；设计了下一状态转换预测的预训练任务，鼓励表示编码未来状态演化的预测信息

Result: 在多分类、多标签分类、预测、轨迹跟踪和异常检测等下游任务中，PLanTS consistently优于现有自监督学习方法，且比基于DTW的方法具有更好的运行时效率

Conclusion: PLanTS通过显式建模不规则潜在状态及其转换，有效提升了多元时间序列的表示质量，为处理高维非平稳时间序列提供了有效的自监督学习解决方案

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

Conclusion: STL规范为BNNs提供了有效的训练目标定义方法，成功实现了在生物医学应用中的回归和控制功能。

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于微控制器内存有限、缺乏原生算子支持和嵌入式友好工具链，部署Mamba模型面临挑战，需要开发轻量级推理引擎。

Method: 将PyTorch Mamba模型导出为轻量格式，用C语言手工实现Mamba层和支持算子，采用算子融合和内存布局优化技术。

Result: 减少83.0%峰值内存，数值误差仅1.7x10-5，在关键词检测和人体活动识别任务上保持100%准确率一致性，在ESP32S3和STM32H7上验证可移植性。

Conclusion: MambaLite-Micro成功将先进序列模型Mamba部署到资源受限嵌入式平台，为实际应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world
resource-constrained applications.

*Peixuan Han,Adit Krishnan,Gerald Friedland,Jiaxuan You,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出自对齐奖励(SAR)，通过相对困惑度差异来补充可验证奖励，在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率，减少30%推理成本并提高4%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可验证奖励信号过于粗糙（只有二元正确性反馈），导致推理过程冗长、计算成本高，且现有解决方案往往牺牲准确性。

Method: 引入自对齐奖励(SAR)，定义为基于查询的答案与独立答案之间的相对困惑度差异，偏好简洁且查询特定的响应。

Result: 在4个模型和7个基准测试中，SAR与PPO、GRPO等RL算法结合，准确率提高4%，推理成本降低30%，在正确性和效率之间达到帕累托最优权衡。

Conclusion: SAR作为可验证奖励的细粒度补充，能够抑制不必要的详细说明而不丢失关键推理，为更高效有效的LLM训练铺平道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

TL;DR: RLA（强化学习与预期）是一个新的分层强化学习框架，通过低层目标条件策略和高层预期模型协同工作，解决长时域目标条件任务的规划问题，具有理论保证和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分层强化学习在自动发现任务层次结构和联合训练多级策略时存在不稳定性和缺乏理论保证的问题，需要一种更原则性的方法来处理长时域目标条件任务。

Conclusion: RLA框架为解决长时域目标条件任务中的分层强化学习问题提供了一个有理论保证、可扩展的解决方案，通过预期模型和价值几何一致性原则实现了稳定的多级策略训练。

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent是一个基于大语言模型的智能压缩系统，通过分析层级的静态指标和动态性能数据，为不同神经网络架构定制剪枝和量化策略，在保持精度的同时显著减少内存使用和提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型面临计算和内存瓶颈，传统压缩技术使用统一启发式方法，忽略了架构和运行时异质性。现有的性能分析工具很少集成到自动化流程中，需要更智能的压缩方法。

Method: 使用多代理系统，通过LLM分析静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存），为特定架构设计层级的剪枝和动态量化策略。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，剪枝保持或提升精度（ImageNet-1K精度下降约1%，小数据集上ViT-B/16提升2%），量化实现高达74%内存节省和<0.5%精度损失，推理速度提升1.74倍。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的智能系统是性能分析引导模型优化的可扩展解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够有效解决医学多模态表示学习中的缺失模态偏差和分布偏差问题，提升模型泛化性能

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)是一个计算昂贵的离散优化问题，现有方法如基于预测器的代理模型和可微分架构搜索存在局限性，需要更高效的优化框架。

Method: 提出OptiProxy-NAS框架，使用代理表示将离散的NAS空间重新表述为连续、可微分且平滑的空间，使任何可微分优化方法都能应用于梯度搜索。

Conclusion: OptiProxy-NAS通过优化代理成功地将NAS转化为可微分优化问题，提供了高效且灵活的架构搜索解决方案。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

Motivation: 解决时间序列异常检测中真正无监督方法的缺乏，以及现有方法在阈值设置上的问题，同时避免对大量标签数据的依赖。

Method: 集成主动学习与现有无监督异常检测方法，通过DQS（差异性基于查询策略）选择性查询多元时间序列标签，使用动态时间扩展评估异常分数相似性以最大化查询样本的多样性。

Result: DQS在小预算场景下表现最佳，其他策略在存在标签错误时更稳健。所有主动学习策略都超过了无监督阈值方法。

Conclusion: 在可能的情况下，使用基于主动学习的阈值方法是推荐的，查询策略的选择应基于专家知识和可标注样本数量。

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

Conclusion: 图基模型在多模态学习中显示出优异的稳健性，特别是在差分隐私条件下，GNN模型能够更好地抵御DP噪声导致的性能下降。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Conclusion: CCP方法为训练不可微分的形态感知器网络提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够成功解决多类分类任务

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: 建议在收集大规模数据集时添加探索数据，而不仅仅依赖专家数据，以减少分布外问题并提高模型的实际性能。

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Abstract: Energy forecasting is vital for grid reliability and operational efficiency.
Although recent advances in time series forecasting have led to progress,
existing benchmarks remain limited in spatial and temporal scope and lack
multi-energy features. This raises concerns about their reliability and
applicability in real-world deployment. To address this, we present the Real-E
dataset, covering over 74 power stations across 30+ European countries over a
10-year span with rich metadata. Using Real- E, we conduct an extensive data
analysis and benchmark over 20 baselines across various model types. We
introduce a new metric to quantify shifts in correlation structures and show
that existing methods struggle on our dataset, which exhibits more complex and
non-stationary correlation dynamics. Our findings highlight key limitations of
current methods and offer a strong empirical basis for building more robust

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布外(OOD)检测对于提高AI系统稳健性至关重要，但现有评估方法在处理ID和OOD数据的差异性时遇到挑战。需要一种更有效的评估框架来确保OOD检测方法的可靠性。

Method: 提出双重交叉验证框架，对ID数据采用标准分割方法，对OOD数据按类别分组进行分割。在存在类别层次的数据中，考虑整个类别层次来获得公平的ID-OOD分割。

Result: 通过对多个独立OOD检测方法的测试，证明该评估框架能够快速收敛到真实性能值，提供更可靠的性能估计。

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD框架为OOD检测方法提供了一种稳健、可靠的评估方法，通过分别处理ID和OOD数据的特性，有助于更准确地评估模型在分布外场景下的表现。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验证明了所提框架的有效性、通用性、鲁棒性和效率

Conclusion: ExoST框架通过创新的"选择-平衡"范式成功解决了外生变量建模中的关键挑战，为时空预测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过激活移植技术证实了基础模型内部存在可操控的语义表征空间，能够通过注入历史事件的统计特征来模拟市场崩溃等突发事件。


<details>

Motivation: 探索变换器基础模型是否真正内部化了语义概念（如市场制度），以及能否利用其内部表征来模拟稀罕但高风险的市场崩溃事件。

Method: 提出激活移植技术，通过在模型前向传播过程中将某个事件（如历史崩溃）的统计矩征强制注入到另一个事件（如平静期）的隐藏状态中。

Result: 注入崩溃语义会导致下跌预测，而注入平静语义则能压制崩溃并恢复稳定性。模型编码了事件严重程度的等级概念，潜在向量的模长与系统性震荡的强度直接相关。

Conclusion: 可操控、语义基础的表征是大型时间序列变换器的稳健特性，为模型预测控制提供了直接的因果干预方法，支持语义级别的"假如"分析和压力测试。

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

Motivation: 现实世界中的多目标任务往往不是相互冲突的，而是可以相互促进的。现有AMOO框架的分析依赖于强凸性假设，这与深度学习实践不符，需要更一般的分析框架。

Conclusion: 成功将AMOO分析扩展到更一般的凸优化设置，为深度学习中的多任务优化提供了更实用的理论基础和算法保证。

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

Result: 绝大多数共形预测输出与人类标注呈现非常弱到弱的相关性，只有少数显示中等相关性。虽然共形预测能提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但其捕捉偶然不确定性的能力仍然有限

Conclusion: 需要批判性地重新评估共形预测器生成的预测集。虽然它们可以提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但在捕捉偶然不确定性方面的能力有限，需要进一步改进

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了机器学习遗忘中的伪造问题，分析了对抗性数据如何通过梯度近似来伪造遗忘效果，证明了在大多数情况下伪造集测度很小，随机采样到伪造点的概率极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私法规和消除有害数据影响的需求驱动，机器学习遗忘旨在修改训练模型以有效"遗忘"指定数据。验证遗忘的关键挑战是伪造问题——对抗性制作数据来模拟目标点的梯度，从而在不实际移除信息的情况下制造遗忘的假象。

Method: 提出了一个分析框架，考虑梯度近似目标梯度在容差ε内的数据点集合（称为ε-伪造集）。对于线性回归和单层神经网络，分析了该集合的Lebesgue测度。在温和的正则性假设下，证明了伪造集测度随ε^(d-r)/2衰减，其中d是数据维度，r是模型梯度定义的变分矩阵的零度。

Result: 研究表明伪造集测度很小，按ε的阶数缩放，当ε足够小时为ε^d。更一般地，测度衰减为ε^(d-r)/2。扩展至批量SGD和几乎处处光滑损失函数得到相同的渐近缩放。建立了概率界限，表明在非退化数据分布下，随机采样到伪造点的可能性极小。

Conclusion: 这些结果提供了证据，表明对抗性伪造在根本上受到限制，虚假的遗忘声明在原则上可以被检测到，为机器学习遗忘的可验证性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

TL;DR: 基于机器学习和物理信息神经网络的假代模型，用于预测液态钠在微型燥液器中的对流传热系数，减少计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真度的流体力学计算模拟液态金属的激流强对流传热时间消耗大、计算成本高，需要更高效的预测方法

Method: 首先使用核机器学习技术和浅层神经网络，然后采用自监督物理信息神经网络和迁移学习方法，通过动态调整物理损失函数权重来平衡数据和物理信息

Result: 自监督物理信息神经网络成功预测钠的传热率，误差范围约为±8%，仅使用物理进行回归时误差为5%-10%，其他机器学习方法预测误差为±8%

Conclusion: 机器学习基于模型为液态金属冷却微型燥液器的设计和优化提供了高效的替代工具，特别是自监督物理信息神经网络方法显著提高了预测精度

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-SQL是一个基于开源大语言模型的Text-to-SQL框架，通过创新的数据库模式专家组件（X-Linking和X-Admin）显著提升模式信息利用，在Spider数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的Text-to-SQL方法往往忽视了数据库模式信息的重要性，而研究发现模式信息在生成高质量SQL查询中起着关键甚至主导作用。

Method: 提出包含两个组件的数据库模式专家：1）X-Linking - 基于LLM监督微调的Schema Linking方法；2）X-Admin - 用于Schema Understanding，弥合抽象模式信息与自然语言问题之间的差距。同时采用多LLM策略为不同组件分配专用模型。

Result: 在Spider-Dev数据集上达到84.9%的执行准确率，在Spider-Test数据集上达到82.5%的执行准确率，成为基于开源模型的最佳Text-to-SQL框架。

Conclusion: X-SQL框架通过有效利用数据库模式信息和多LLM策略，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了模式信息在此任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SOOTT框架，整合了目标跟踪、对抗扰动和切换成本三个关键目标，并开发了BEST算法和基于学习的CoRT算法来解决在线决策问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中在线决策的不确定性问题，如AI集群中的工作负载调度，需要同时平衡长期服务协议和突发需求

Method: 首先提出具有竞争性保证的BEST算法，然后引入CoRT学习增强变体，整合不可信的黑色盒预测来改进决策

Result: 理论分析显示CoRT在预测准确时优于BEST，同时在任意预测错误下保持鲁棒性。案例研究验证了算法在平衡轨迹跟踪、决策平滑性和抗干扰能力方面的有效性

Conclusion: SOOTT框架和相应算法为在线决策提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在工作负载调度等实际应用中能够很好地平衡多个竞争目标

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

*Vignesh Ethiraj,Subhash Talluri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了统一交互基础模型(UIFM)，采用复合标记化方法将多属性事件作为语义连贯单元处理，相比传统文本序列化方法能更好地理解用户行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自然语言的基础模型在处理电信、电商、金融等领域结构化交互事件时存在语义碎片化问题，无法真正理解行为的整体性。

Method: 采用复合标记化(composite tokenization)技术，将每个多属性事件视为单一的语义连贯单元，学习用户行为的"语法"。

Result: UIFM架构不仅更准确，而且代表了向创建更适应性和智能预测系统迈出的根本性一步。

Conclusion: 该模型能够感知完整的交互过程而非离散的数据流，为行为理解提供了新的基础模型范式。

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PolicyEvolve是一个基于LLM的多智能体对抗游戏程序化策略生成框架，通过迭代进化的方式减少对人工编码和环境交互的依赖，生成高性能且可解释的策略代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习需要大量样本和计算资源，且神经网络策略缺乏可解释性，限制了实际部署。受LLM在单智能体任务中生成程序化策略的启发，希望将其扩展到多玩家游戏中。

Method: 框架包含四个模块：全局池保存精英策略，局部池存储临时策略，策略规划器基于环境信息和反馈生成策略，轨迹批评器分析策略弱点并提供改进方向。通过迭代进化过程不断优化策略。

Result: 显著减少了对人工编写策略代码的依赖，以最少的环境交互实现了高性能策略的生成。

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve为多玩家游戏提供了一种高效的程序化策略生成方法，平衡了性能、效率和可解释性，为MARL的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

TL;DR: ARIES是一个评估时间序列属性与建模策略关系的框架，通过合成数据集和50多个预测模型的基准测试，建立了属性与策略的关联，并实现了首个深度预测模型推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集缺乏多样化和明确定义的时间模式，无法系统评估模型性能与数据属性的内在联系，且缺乏有效的模型推荐方法，导致测试不同架构时耗费大量时间和成本。

Method: 首先构建具有多种不同模式的合成数据集，设计综合系统计算时间序列属性；然后对50多个预测模型进行广泛基准测试，建立时间序列属性与建模策略的关系；基于这些发现提出深度预测模型推荐器。

Result: 实验结果显示时间序列属性与建模策略之间存在明确的相关性，成功实现了首个能够为现实世界时间序列提供可解释建议的深度预测模型推荐系统。

Conclusion: ARIES是首个建立时间序列数据属性与建模策略关系的研究，同时实现了模型推荐系统，为时间序列预测领域提供了系统性的评估和推荐框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元法在大规模高温超导磁体设计中计算成本高，限制了快速设计能力

Method: 开发了基于全连接殊余神经网络(FCRN)的代模型，使用有限元法模拟数据进行训练

Result: 12个殊余块和每层256个神经元的网络结构表现最佳，外推能力达到训练范围的50%，最大误差低于10%，计算速度提高数个数量级

Conclusion: 该FCRN基于代模型为大规模HTS磁体的快速分析提供了准确而高效的工具

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

Motivation: 解决神经运算符在训练数据稀缺时表现差、且缺乏显式因果关系和时间本地结构编码的问题，同时免除自回归模型的错误累积问题

Method: 采用图神经网模拟器(GNS)框架，结合显式数值时间步进方案，通过建模瞬时时间导数来学习PDE解，并使用PCA+KMeans轨迹选择策略

Result: 在三个标准PDE系统中，GNS仅需30个训练样本(总数据的3%)即达到小于1%的相对L2误差，比DeepONet和FNO基线更准确。在延长时间范围内，GNS平均减少82.48%的自回归误差(FNO AR)和99.86%的误差(DON AR)

Conclusion: 结合图基本地归纳偏置与传统时间积分器，可以构建准确、物理一致且可扩展的时间依赖PDE汇母模型

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR)
environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden
rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We
explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and
Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations
and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy
through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and
trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact
of representation on learning efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了差分隐私图聚类中的噪声、效率和可解释性问题，为隐私保护的图数据分析提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods
in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: 该工作为高精度无线电地图生成、MIMO空间性能和6G环境感知的机器学习研究提供了关键数据集和参考

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the
strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms

Method: 使用冻结LLM加轻量适配器生成文本条件用户/物品嵌入，LightGCN学习协同嵌入，通过对称对比目标对齐两种视图，采用层内门控融合机制

Result: 在Yelp和Amazon-Electronics数据集上，所有8个指标均达到最佳结果，Recall@40和NDCG@40相对提升分别达4.53%和4.01%

Conclusion: 跨视图对齐是必要的，门控融合优于后期融合和纯LLM变体，语言模型在冷启动/长尾场景占主导，图结构在其他场景稳定排序

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

Motivation: 静默数据错误(SDEs)会降低安全关键系统的可靠性，功能测试检测相关故障但仿真成本高昂，需要高效的故障影响预测方法

Method: 将门级网表建模为时空图以捕捉拓扑和信号时序，使用专用的空间和时间编码器来高效预测多周期故障影响概率

Result: 在ISCAS-89基准测试中，方法减少仿真时间10倍以上，同时保持高精度(5周期预测的平均绝对误差为0.024)，测试点选择研究表明基于预测FIPs选择观测点可改善难检测故障的检测

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到SoC级测试策略优化，适用于下游电子设计自动化流程，为故障影响预测提供了高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream
electronic design automation flows.

TL;DR: LoaQ是一种针对层级后训练量化的输出近似方法，通过目标输出级一致性来更好地实现量化直觉，在LLaMA和Qwen模型上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的层级后训练量化方法采用局部视角，只能实现权重激活感知的近似，导致近似不足且与原始输出存在偏差，需要更准确的输出级一致性方法。

Method: 基于对主流LLM结构特征的深入理解，提出LoaQ方法，明确以输出级一致性为目标，具有简单闭式解，可与现有量化技术正交集成。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型家族上的实验表明，LoaQ在仅权重量化和权重-激活联合量化中均表现有效，能进一步提升整体量化质量。

Conclusion: LoaQ方法更好地实现了量化直觉，具有简单闭式解，能与现有量化策略无缝集成，有潜力推动后训练量化的前沿发展。

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法无法泛化到其他站点或难以融入能源领域特定数据的问题，需要开发专门针对风电预测的基础模型。

Method: 采用离散化-生成框架：首先使用专门的时间序列分词器将连续多变量观测转换为离散分层标记，然后通过仅解码器Transformer在标记序列上进行自回归预训练。

Result: 8.1M参数的紧凑模型在确定性和概率性任务上实现零样本最先进性能，优于专门模型和更大的基础模型，在不同大陆的分布外数据下表现出强适应性。

Conclusion: WindFM展示了学习表示的鲁棒性和可迁移性，为风电预测提供了有效的通用基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个冗余指数ρ(C)来直接量化潜在表示中的维度间依赖性，通过分析耦合矩阵并与正态分布比较来评估表示质量。该指标能可靠预测模型性能，并可用于指导神经架构搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低了有效容量并阻碍泛化。标准指标如准确率或重建损失只能提供间接证据，无法直接隔离冗余问题。

Method: 引入冗余指数ρ(C)，通过分析潜在表示的耦合矩阵，将其非对角线统计量与正态分布通过能量距离进行比较，从而量化维度间依赖性。

Result: 在MNIST变体、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的实验表明，低ρ(C)可靠预测高分类准确率或低重建误差，而高冗余与性能崩溃相关。TPE优先探索低ρ区域。

Conclusion: ρ(C)提供了一个理论视角和实用工具，用于评估和改进学习表示的效率，揭示了冗余作为跨模型和任务的通用瓶颈问题。

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Result: 模型预测精度随上下文长度增加而提高，但在更细的空间离散化下会下降；多步预测误差随时间范围代数增长；模型学习过程呈现从模式模仿到数值预测的渐进过程。

Conclusion: LLMs能够通过上下文学习有效处理偏微分方程的时空预测，展现出类似传统数值求解器的误差积累特性，并揭示了从语法模仿到数值预测的渐进学习模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型数值推理的鲁棒性，虽然LLM展现出卓越的涌现能力，但其数学计算能力的基础弱点仍不明确，需要通过系统化测试来揭示。

Method: 构建包含100个问题的挑战集，分为四个复杂度递增的类别：基础算术、高级运算、素数检查和24点数字游戏。测试多个最先进的LLM智能体在这些问题上的表现。

Result: LLM智能体在前三个需要确定性算法执行的类别中准确率很高，但在需要在大组合空间中进行启发式搜索的24点游戏中持续失败。

Conclusion: LLM的数值推理能力主要局限于回忆和执行已知算法，而非生成性解决问题，其表现更接近复杂的模式匹配而非灵活的分析思维，限制了在需要新颖或创造性数值洞察任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视并改进了基于统计物理的变分门控(VG)方法，用于高维数据的关键变量选择，通过自动微分技术实现可扩展优化，在高度稀疏场景下表现优于Ridge和LASSO回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从高维数据中选择关键变量变得越来越重要。稀疏回归通过促进模型简洁性和可解释性为此提供了有力工具，但现有方法在高度稀疏场景下的表现有待改进。

Method: 重新利用基于统计物理的变分门控(VG)方法，引入显式特征选择自旋变量，利用变分推断推导可处理的损失函数，并整合现代自动微分技术实现可扩展和高效的优化。

Result: VG在高度稀疏场景下表现优异，比Ridge和LASSO回归提供更一致和鲁棒的变量选择。发现了一个尖锐的转变点：当引入多余变量时，泛化能力急剧下降，选择变量的不确定性增加，这个转变点可用于估计相关变量的正确数量。

Conclusion: VG在稀疏建模方面具有强大潜力，可广泛应用于压缩感知和机器学习中的模型剪枝等领域，为高维数据变量选择提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Conclusion: MGKD框架能够通过知识蓄米技术有效将服务中用户行为数据的关键信息转移到服务前风险预测模型中，显著提升风险预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法通过经验调整负汝项来处理约束，缺乏理论收敛保证，并经常无法满足实际场景中的QoS要求。

Method: 首先扩展WMMSE算法到多通道设置并加入QoS约束（eWMMSE），然后发展GNN基算法JCPGNN-M支持同时多通道分配。重点是将GNN与拉格朗日乘子优化方法结合，确保约束满足和收敛性。

Result: 模拟实验显示JCPGNN-M在性能上可以比美eWMMSE，同时在推理速度、大规模网络的泛化能力以及不完整通道状态信息下的稳健性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种可扩展且理论坚实的方案，用于解决未来无线网络中带约束的资源分配问题。

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse
engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but
they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing
quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse
support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately
and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery
and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level
models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized
compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common
DNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can
decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models.
NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

Motivation: 物联网传感器产生大量时空数据流，但数据可信度是关键挑战。传统时空图模型在动态、以人为中心的环境中存在两个根本局限：静态图拓扑无法捕捉物理事件驱动的动态性，以及容易混淆虚假相关性和真实因果关系。

Method: 提出DyC-STG框架，包含两个协同贡献：事件驱动的动态图模块实时调整图拓扑以反映物理状态变化；因果推理模块通过严格强制执行时间优先性来提取因果感知表示。

Conclusion: DyC-STG有效解决了物联网数据可信度分析中的动态拓扑和因果混淆问题，为智能家居等应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive
interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.

Conclusion: 本文成功扩展了WGAN最优参数的理论框架，为非线性非高斯情况提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

Conclusion: QualityFM提供了一个通用的生理信号质量理解框架，具有良好的跨任务迁移能力和实用价值，能够有效解决临床信号质量问题

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

*John Tolladay,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了一种可解释的监督变分自动编码器模型，用于根据妊娠结果分类胎心电图信号，在保持竞争性预测性能的同时提供部分临床意义的特征编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在胎心电图分析中的可解释性限制，开发能够同时进行信号重建和结果预测的监督变分自动编码器模型。

Method: 使用OxMat胎心电图数据集训练VAE模型，在五分钟胎心率段落上进行训练。模型结构包含Kullback-Leibler散度和总相关约束，以结构潜在空间。通过AUROC和MSE评估性能，使用决定系数、潜在遍历和无监督分解进行可解释性分析。

Result: 模型在段落层面达到AUROC 0.752，在整个胎心电图层面达到0.779。改善总相关约束后重建和分类性能都提升。潜在空间中基线相关特征（如胎心率基线、基线移动）得到良好表征，而短期和长期变异性编码较弱。

Conclusion: 监督VAE模型能够在保持竞争性预测性能的同时部分编码具有临床意义的胎心电图特征。虽然未完全实现可解释性，但为未来可解释生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

TL;DR: CLAN是一种新颖的自监督学习范式，将增强样本作为负样本（代表恶意流量），良性样本作为正样本，显著提升了网络入侵检测的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习需要大量标注数据，而异常检测方法误报率高。现有自监督方法通过数据增强生成正样本视图，但本工作认为增强样本应代表潜在的恶意分布。

Method: 提出CLAN方法：将增强样本作为负视图（代表恶意流量），其他良性样本作为正视图，通过对比学习学习区分性表征。

Result: 在Lycos2017数据集上，CLAN在二分类任务中超越了现有自监督和异常检测方法；在有限标注数据上微调后，多分类性能也优于现有自监督模型。

Conclusion: CLAN通过创新的负样本构造策略，有效提升了网络入侵检测性能，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

Motivation: 解决设备端实时数据分布变化对轻量级模型泛化能力的挑战，避免传统数据密集型和计算昂贵的微调方法。

Method: 使用基于原型的参数编辑框架，在云端通过神经适配器生成参数编辑矩阵，动态调整设备端模型参数并聚类为原型模型，结合跨层知识转移实现多层参数一致性调整。

Result: 在多个视觉和推荐任务数据集上的广泛实验证实了Persona方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: Persona提供了一种无需部署后重新训练的有效个性化方法，能够显著提升设备端模型对实时数据分布变化的适应能力。

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

Motivation: 虽然人工智能有望加速科学发现，但其益处分布不均。技术障碍如数据稀缺、标准碎片化和计算资源获取不平等固然重要，但作者认为主要障碍是社会和制度性的

Method: 通过分析当前AI科学领域的现状，识别出四个相互关联的挑战：社区功能障碍、研究优先级与上游需求错位、数据碎片化、基础设施不平等，并指出其根源在于文化和组织实践

Result: 提出了解决这些挑战需要技术创新之外的方法，包括有意识的社区建设、跨学科教育、共享基准和可访问的基础设施

Conclusion: 呼吁将AI科学重新定义为集体社会项目，将可持续协作和公平参与视为技术进步的前提条件

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its
benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce
data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant,
we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives
that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data
and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between
domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

Method: 采用结构化分解和方差分析方法，引入方向性下界来度量系统组件间的相互作用，提出行为指标和记忆有限性指数，建立基于功率的条件来连接有限记忆和热力学第一定律。

Result: 提出了行为不确定性原理，证明静态和动态失真不能同时最小化；建立了函数方差与均方Lipschitz连续性及学习复杂度的联系；开发了模型无关的任务感知复杂度度量方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂动态非线性系统建模提供了可扩展的理论基础方法，解释了结构化残差学习在功率放大器线性化等应用中的经验优势，包括改进泛化性、减少参数数量和降低训练成本。

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对动态图环境中图卷积网络(GCNs)的PAC-Bayesian理论分析，建立了包含数据依赖性和非平稳性影响的泛化边界，为理解GNN在动态图上的泛化性能提供了理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图具有动态特性，新节点不断加入，现有连接随时间变化。现有的基于转导学习框架的理论研究无法充分建模这种时间演化和结构动态性。

Method: 采用PAC-Bayesian理论分析方法，将节点视为依赖且非同分布的数据点，推导了一层和两层GCNs的泛化边界，并建立了保证泛化间隙收敛到零的充分条件。

Result: 推导出了显式包含数据依赖性和非平稳性影响的泛化边界，发现两层GCNs需要更强的图拓扑假设才能保证收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和改进动态图环境中GNN的泛化性能建立了理论基础，揭示了不同层数GCNs在动态图上的理论保证条件差异。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

Result: 代理捐得高重要性信息的94%（包含部分含义），在严格含义标准下TBFact可能率达0.84，支持无数据分享的本地部署

Conclusion: HAO和TBFact为血液病学会议提供了可靠、可扩展的自动化支持基础

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

Result: 发现最后一层引导向量在第一个生成token上表现为token替换偏置，倒数第二层引导向量主要通过MLP和反嵌入机制优先加权过程词和结构符号。

Conclusion: 这些结果为解释推理训练引起的行为变化建立了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

Conclusion: 识别了当前开放挑战并提出了未来研究方向，旨在推动这一新兴领域的进一步发展，提升GAD模型在复杂现实环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

Result: 在CBCP数据集上，BEAM在多项指标上优于最先进方法，证明了客观共情评估的潜力

Conclusion: BEAM为儿童共情能力提供了客观评估工具，并为早期干预儿童亲社会发展提供了初步见解

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

Motivation: 解决在欧几里得度平面随机图上的全对路径路由问题，并实现可扩展的高效路由策略学习。

Method: 利用域知识选择输入特征和设计策略函数，训练DNN学习局部路由策略，仅需单个图的少量数据样本。

Result: 学习到的一个DNN准确匹配传统贪心转发策略，新提出的GreedyTensile路由策略性能几乎总是超过贪心转发，且具有可解释性和超低延迟运行特性。

Conclusion: 证明了通过域知识指导的DNN学习可以在网络路由领域实现高效、可扩展且可解释的策略学习。

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

Motivation: 个体出行行为响应的建模对城市交通监管和政策评估至关重要，但马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)在此背景下数据需求量大，面临数据量、时空覆盖和情境多样性等挑战。

Method: 提出群体效应增强的生成对抗模仿学习(gcGAIL)模型，利用乘客群体间的共享行为模式来提高个体行为建模效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，gcGAIL在准确性、泛化性和模式演示效率方面优于AIRL、基线GAIL和条件GAIL等先进基准方法，对空间变化、数据稀疏性和行为多样性具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: gcGAIL模型能够预测任何时间的个体行为响应，为个性化激励提供基础，以诱导可持续的行为改变（更好的激励时机选择）。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载自组织网络(VANETs)中的路由面临动态拓扑、不完全观测和边缘设备资源有限的挑战，现有RL方法假设固定图结构且需要重新训练，不适合受限硬件部署。

Method: 提出TrajAware框架，包含三个组件：动作空间剪枝减少冗余邻居选项；图交叉注意力将剪枝邻居映射到全局图上下文；轨迹感知预测使用历史路由和路口信息估计实时位置。

Result: 在SUMO模拟器中使用真实城市地图进行评估，TrajAware实现了接近最短路径和高投递率，同时在完全和部分观测场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: TrajAware框架在保持边缘设备效率的同时，解决了VANETs中的路由挑战，为智能交通系统的边缘AI部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比MSE、RMSE、MAE和log-cosh等经典损失函数，实现了更优越和更快速的逼近性能。

Conclusion: BNN结合LWPE损失函数为资源受限环境下的非线性连续函数逼近提供了灵活且几何可解释的解决方案，通过优化基点实现了高效学习。

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于概率模型的智能代理理论，通过对数加权池化定义代理组合，证明在三种或更多结果空间中可实现严格一致性，并形式化了LLM中的代理对齐现象（Luigi/Waluigi效应）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为神经模型建立智能代理的理论基础，探索子代理如何聚合成十分的高级实体，并为代理AI系统的对齐提供新的理论指导。

Method: 以概率模型为基础，将代理表示为结果分布，以对数得分为认知效用，通过对数加权池化定义代理组合，并采用克隆不变性、连续性和开放性来建立递归结构。

Result: 证明在线性池化或二元结果空间中不可能实现严格一致性，但在三种或更多结果空间中可能。形式化了LLM中的代理对齐现象：引导善良人设（Luigi）会产生对抗对应物（Waluigi），而显现-压制Waluigi策略比纯粹Luigi增强能更大程度减少一阶对齐问题。

Conclusion: 建立一个有理论基础的数学框架来描述子代理如何聚合成十分的高级实体，为代理AI系统的对齐问题提供了新的见解和解决方案。

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in
deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We
focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making
applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal
variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as
hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its
computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency
FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP

Conclusion: 混合设计在原则性小波框架内统一了短距离和长距离信息流，有效解决了长程图交互建模问题

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Conclusion: DRL和DPO技术对开发稳健且与人类对齐的大型视觉语言模型具有重要意义，但仍面临可扩展性、样本效率、持续学习、泛化能力和安全性等开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出异步消息传递框架解决GNN中的过度压缩问题，通过基于节点中心性的批次更新来提升长距离交互性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN存在过度压缩问题，特别是在需要长距离交互的任务中。图重连方法会破坏归纳偏置，而增加通道容量又会增加模型复杂度

Method: 提出模型无关的异步更新框架，基于节点中心性创建批次，在每层只更新批次内节点特征，避免同步压缩到固定容量通道

Result: 在6个标准图数据集和2个长距离数据集上测试，在REDDIT-BINARY和Peptides-struct上分别获得5%和4%的性能提升

Conclusion: 异步消息传递框架能有效缓解GNN的过度压缩问题，保持更高的特征敏感度，同时不增加模型复杂度

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在自主导航和运动控制等数据收集成本高且危险的领域具有重要价值，但面临状态-动作空间覆盖有限和长时程任务泛化的挑战

Method: 基于Eikonal偏微分方程推导物理信息正则化损失，与连续时间最优控制理论相结合，使价值函数与代价结构对齐，可集成到基于时序差分的价值学习中

Result: 与分层隐式Q学习结合形成的Pi-HIQL方法在性能和泛化方面显著提升，在拼接机制和大规模导航任务中表现尤为突出

Conclusion: 物理信息正则化方法为离线目标条件强化学习提供了有效的几何归纳偏置，能够改善价值函数学习并提升算法性能

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

Motivation: 解决AI能力快速增长与安全进展迟滞之间的差距。现有方法要么是后置对齐和护栏（Make AI Safe）但容易碎片化，要么强调内在安全性（Make Safe AI）但难以应对开放环境中的未预见风险。

Method: 提出R²AI框架，整合快速和慢速安全模型、通过安全风洞进行对抗模拟和验证、以及持续反馈循环，使安全性与能力协同进化。

Result: 该框架为在动态环境中维持持续安全提供了可扩展的前知路径，能够同时处理近期漏洞和长期存在风险。

Conclusion: safe-by-coevolution作为一种新的"Make Safe AI"范式，通过动态、对抗性的持续学习过程，为AI向AGI和ASI发展过程中的安全问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

Conclusion: 迭代计算在价值学习方面具有巨大潜力，floq方法通过精细控制积分步数实现了比传统单体架构更好的Q函数容量扩展

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE通过智能体交互框架有效解决了传统过采样技术的局限性，为类别不平衡问题提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for
vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

Conclusion: SEELE通过实例级动态难度调整，有效提高了RLVR的探索效率咏推理性能，解决了问题难度与模型能力不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem

efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

TL;DR: 两层神经网络可以学习有限群中的任意词操作，在足够宽度下表现出grokking现象，通过低秩张量分解实现高效实现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络如何学习群操作并解释grokking现象背后的机制

Method: 将问题重构为学习特定3-张量，利用群的自共轭表示分解和融合结构，通过低秩实现来近似词张量

Result: 网络能够找到低秩实现或近似，在有限宽度下实现泛化，对于乘法词操作可有效实现Strassen风格的矩阵乘法

Conclusion: 揭示了神经网络通过梯度下降找到低秩解决方案的机制，为理解grokking现象提供了理论解释

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统在科学、商业和政府领域的广泛应用，理解其失败模式（如幻觉问题）对于高风险应用中的信任和采用至关重要。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器捕获预训练transformer模型中的概念表示，在输入空间具有实验控制不确定性的场景下系统分析幻觉产生机制。

Result: 研究发现输入信息越非结构化，模型使用的语义概念数量越多；面对输入不确定性时，模型容易激活连贯但输入不敏感的语义特征；纯噪声输入也能触发有意义的内部概念。

Conclusion: 这些发现对AI模型与人类价值观对齐、AI安全、对抗攻击漏洞以及自动量化模型幻觉风险提供了重要基础。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于结果的强化学习虽然能显著提高LLM的推理准确性，但会导致系统性的生成多样性损失，这在实际应用中会影响测试时的扩展性能。研究发现RL甚至会在训练集上降低有效多样性。

Method: 提出基于结果的探索方法：1）历史探索 - 使用UCB风格的奖励来鼓励罕见答案；2）批量探索 - 惩罚批次内重复以促进测试时多样性。在标准数学竞赛数据集上使用Llama和Qwen模型进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明两种方法都能在提高准确性的同时缓解多样性崩溃问题。理论方面通过新的基于结果的多臂老虎机模型形式化了基于结果探索的益处。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为开发既能增强推理能力又不牺牲多样性（对可扩展部署至关重要）的RL方法指明了实用路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.
