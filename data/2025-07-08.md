Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving
continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving
dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment:
alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of
simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired
conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle
pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports
analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\%
blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and
sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a
set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will
be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.

*Miao Fan,Quanxin Zheng,Shengtong Xu,Linghe Kong,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRC-VMap是一种基于视觉的端到端神经网络，用于生成高清矢量地图，利用路边监控摄像头降低成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的LiDAR或性能有限的摄像头，MRC-VMap旨在填补这一空白，提供高效且经济的解决方案。

Method: 利用多方向摄像头图像直接生成矢量地图，省去中间模块，减少计算和误差传播。

Result: 在4000个中国城市交叉口的实验中，性能优于现有在线方法，接近高成本LiDAR方案。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap为自动驾驶导航提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Conclusion: MLLMs在网球视频分析中具有潜力，需进一步优化训练方法以提高性能。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically
complex sport. Our approach introduces a standardised annotation methodology
encompassing player positioning, shot types, court formations, and match
outcomes, coupled with a specialised annotation tool designed to meet the
unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose
estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex
visual and contextual features essential for doubles tennis analysis. Our
integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical
analysis, performance evaluation, and strategic modelling in professional
tennis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物不安全是城市公共卫生问题，现有调查方法难以扩展，需探索新方法。

Method: 采用两步法：特征提取和门控注意力机制进行图像聚合。

Result: 模型预测能力略逊于其他架构，但权重解释和案例研究显示潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为现有食物不安全识别方法的补充，为城市规划者提供支持。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现开放世界和逼真环境中的可靠推理，超越基于场景的方法，支持零样本环境识别。

Method: 结合度量学习和自监督学习，在潜在空间估计对象分布，并引入EDS函数验证表示对齐。

Result: 在链式检索任务中表现优于场景方法，支持零样本环境识别。

Conclusion: OBSER框架为自主环境理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

### [8] [GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941)
*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GameTileNet是一个低分辨率游戏图块的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏内容与叙事不一致的问题，以及训练数据风格分布不均导致的视觉多样性受限。

Method: 收集艺术家创作的游戏图块并提供语义标注，建立低分辨率图块对象检测流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的内容生成，并为低分辨率非真实感图像的对象检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法、丰富游戏叙事内容的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

### [9] [Iterative Zoom-In: Temporal Interval Exploration for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02946)
*Chenglin Li,Qianglong Chen,fengtao,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Search（TS）的训练免费框架，通过迭代调整时间区间来提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间焦点来解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两个迭代阶段实现：1）提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从区间中采样固定数量帧并生成置信度评分。此外，引入TS-BFS策略进一步优化效率。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间焦点，减少了内存消耗并提高了长视频理解的准确性。

Conclusion: TS框架显著提升了MLLMs在长视频任务中的表现，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶在长尾场景中因动态环境不确定性和数据覆盖不足导致的安全预测挑战。

Method: 引入基于BEV的运动模拟方法合成高风险数据DriveMRP-10K，并设计VLM无关的DriveMRP-Agent框架，结合全局上下文和轨迹投影。

Result: 实验显示DriveMRP-Agent显著提升VLM性能，事故识别准确率从27.13%升至88.03%，零样本测试中从29.42%升至68.50%。

Conclusion: DriveMRP-10K和DriveMRP-Agent框架有效增强VLM的运动风险预测能力，具备强泛化性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传染病大流行期间（如埃博拉和SARS），快速、非侵入性的发热筛查方法对公共场所（如医院和机场）的温度监测至关重要。

Method: 采用粗-精配准策略，结合基于标志点和眼轮廓边缘检测的配准模型，实现红外和白光图像的多模态配准。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了高精度的眼角区域定位，有助于提升红外热像仪在发热筛查中的实用性。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Preethi Raju,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSAT的新型注意力机制，通过压缩感知技术降低计算复杂度，适用于视觉语言模型（vLLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理更长的视频序列和更丰富的语言描述，标准注意力机制的二次复杂度成为计算瓶颈，CSAT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CSAT通过随机测量矩阵将高维键值表示投影到低维子空间，并使用稀疏恢复算法重建注意力输出，从而降低复杂度。

Result: CSAT在保持语义保真度的同时显著降低了注意力复杂度，并在标准基准测试中验证了其性能。

Conclusion: CSAT是一种可扩展、可解释且资源高效的多模态变换器解决方案，适用于下一代视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

### [13] [VR-YOLO: Enhancing PCB Defect Detection with Viewpoint Robustness Based on YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02963)
*Hengyi Zhu,Linye Wei,He Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于YOLOv8的增强PCB缺陷检测算法VR-YOLO，通过多样化场景增强和关键对象聚焦机制，显著提升了模型的泛化性能和视角鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检测算法对目标图像的角度、方向和清晰度要求严格，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 采用多样化场景增强（DSE）方法扩展数据集，并提出关键对象聚焦（KOF）方案，结合角度损失和注意力机制优化小目标特征学习。

Result: 改进算法在原始测试图像上的mAP达到98.9%，在视角变化的测试图像上达到94.7%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VR-YOLO在保持低计算成本的同时，显著提升了PCB缺陷检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念的对抗攻击框架，通过概率视角生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念的同时误导分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击仅针对单张图像，缺乏多样性且可能破坏原始概念。本文旨在扩展攻击范围至整个概念，生成更具多样性的对抗样本。

Method: 采用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成多样化的对抗图像，保持原始概念但改变姿态、视角或背景。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明，该方法能生成更多样化的对抗样本，有效保留概念并提高攻击效率。

Conclusion: 基于概念的对抗攻击框架在多样性和概念保留上优于传统方法，具有更高的攻击效率。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater
environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion,
and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail
to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection
in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial

comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured
beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating
target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated
that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在全国范围内提供农场级、季节性作物识别数据的潜力，为农业监测和管理提供了可操作的数据驱动见解。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨AI如何通过MidJourney生成《出埃及记》2:5-9的视觉图像，分析其模仿与创造性生成的能力，并评估其美学、神学和文化维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在重现或重新想象神圣叙事方面的潜力，以及其在艺术创作中的局限性和偏见。

Method: 通过比较视觉分析（包括Google图像和古典绘画），评估AI生成图像的风格、神学和文化的表现。

Result: AI能生成美学丰富的图像，但受限于训练数据的偏见，缺乏真正的创造力、作者意图和神学深度。

Conclusion: AI可作为重新解读圣经文本的创意伙伴，但其在神圣艺术中的角色仍具争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出新评估框架，测试视觉语言模型在空间变形推理任务中的表现，发现现有模型能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型是否真正具备空间推理能力。

Method: 构建从2D到3D的空间变形推理基准，采用阶梯式竞争形式评估模型。

Result: 几乎所有模型在空间变形推理任务中表现不佳，即使经过针对性训练。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在空间变形推理方面仍有显著局限性。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集常包含噪声、错误标签或难以泛化的图像，尤其是边缘案例和罕见结果，同时高质量数据集样本量小易导致过拟合，这对医疗诊断的准确性构成风险。

Method: IMET框架结合课程学习和核心集选择，通过迭代识别误分类样本，优化训练过程，并优先关注边缘案例和罕见结果。

Result: 在基准医学图像分类数据集上，IMET展现出提升模型鲁棒性和准确性的潜力。

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种有效的数据高效训练策略，能够应对噪声和小样本的挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

*Yusuf Shihata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRF（Gated Recurrent Fusion）是一种线性可扩展的循环架构，通过对称交叉注意力和门控融合单元实现高效的多模态融合，解决了传统方法计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，深度细粒度融合与计算可扩展性之间存在矛盾。传统交叉注意力模型虽性能强，但二次复杂度限制了多模态场景的应用。

Method: GRF采用循环处理方式，通过Transformer解码器层实现对称交叉注意力，动态更新多模态上下文向量，并使用门控融合单元（GFU）选择性地整合信息。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中，GRF性能与复杂基线模型相当，同时线性复杂度（O(n)）使其适用于高模态环境。可视化显示GRF能生成结构化、类别可分的表示。

Conclusion: GRF为高效、可扩展的多模态表示学习提供了新范式，平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Motivation: 构建泛化性强的医疗AI系统需要数据高效且领域感知的预训练策略，但临床数据集（如MIMIC-CXR）图像数量有限且标注稀缺。

Method: 将成对的胸部X光片（正面和侧面视图）作为自然正样本对，学习从稀疏补丁重建每个视图并对其潜在嵌入进行对齐。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR上评估，相比监督目标和未利用结构的基线，表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: 为数据稀缺但结构化的领域特定预训练提供了轻量级、模态无关的蓝图。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

addition, we introduce a new distance metric between camera poses, the
Boresight Deviation Distance, which is better suited for view synthesis than
existing metrics. Using it, a method for increasing the density of image

Motivation: 随着扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion 3.5）生成的合成图像越来越逼真，现有检测方法面临挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：ResNet-18提取空间特征，轻量CNN处理2D FFT频谱，多层感知机分析径向能量分布。

Conclusion: FreqCross通过频域分析揭示了合成图像在0.1--0.4归一化频率范围内的独特特征，为检测提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic
images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised
frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and
pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.

Conclusion: TG-MILNet为非侵入性脊柱侧弯检测提供了高效解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

Method: 使用HOG和TDA分别提取特征，训练七种经典机器学习模型，通过10折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: XGBoost表现最优，HOG和TDA在二分类任务中准确率分别为94.29%和94.18%，多分类任务中为74.41%和74.69%。

Conclusion: HOG和TDA性能相当但捕捉不同特征，适用于医学图像分析，可集成到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在推理后期过度依赖文本信息，忽视了视觉输入的整合，导致推理能力受限。

Method: 通过分析MLLM的注意力模式，发现其可以自发重新关注视觉输入，基于此提出了Look-Back方法，指导模型自主决定何时、何地及如何重新关注视觉信息。

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型的推理和感知能力，在多个多模态基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备内在的视觉融合推理能力，Look-Back方法通过隐式引导实现了更高效的视觉信息整合。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像越来越难以与真实图像区分，这威胁了数字媒体的可信度，因此需要开发泛化性强的检测器。

Method: LATTE通过建模潜在嵌入在多步去噪过程中的轨迹，结合潜在-视觉特征细化模块和轻量级分类器，实现高效检测。

Result: LATTE在GenImage和DiffusionFake等基准测试中表现优异，且在跨生成器和跨数据集场景下具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 潜在轨迹嵌入是区分生成图像的有效方法，LATTE为生成图像检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

TL;DR: 本文探索了可解释提升机（EBM）结合特征工程在气象学中的应用，特别是用于卫星图像中过冲顶（OTs）的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，可解释的机器学习算法（如EBM）具有优势，但其在大气科学中应用较少。本文旨在开发可解释的、基于物理的机器学习方法用于气象学。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），并应用EBM进行分类任务，训练数据来自卫星传感器和雷达系统。

Result: 最终模型虽未达到复杂方法的精度，但表现良好，是可解释机器学习在气象学中的重要进展。

Conclusion: EBM结合特征工程为气象学提供了可解释的机器学习方法，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Motivation: 研究目的是简化刚体旋转的测量过程，无需依赖物体形状或场景先验知识。

Method: 通过跟踪图像中的一个特征点，解析计算刚体的瞬时旋转速率，适用于并行处理，并能区分不同刚体的点。

Result: 仿真和实际视频数据验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于物体形状和场景知识，适用于实时分析和场景分割。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法（如对比学习）在人类活动识别（HAR）中具有吸引力。然而，HAR传感器信号存在显著的受试者间域偏移，导致模型难以泛化到新受试者。

Method: 提出Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)，通过重新加权来自同一受试者的负样本对，抑制受试者特异性信息，强调活动特异性特征。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试（UTD-MHAD、MMAct和DARai）上，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，能够提升HAR模型的泛化能力，并适用于多种自监督方法、多模态场景和监督学习框架。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Result: 模型轻量且泛化能力强，支持直观的图像编辑和风格化，如对象定位、旋转和调整大小。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了图像合成的应用范围，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Result: 实验证实部分视觉编码器贡献极小或负面，冗余现象普遍。

Conclusion: 当前多编码器设计存在低效问题，CUR和IG可作为诊断工具优化多模态架构。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Method: 设计了统计动态样本校正模块（SDSR）和双频门选择蒸馏模块（DGSD），分别用于优化样本纯度和实现双频数据的互补学习。

Result: 在四个实测双频PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，SKDNet-SSR优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR通过样本校正和双频数据互补学习，有效提升了双频PolSAR图像的分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）基准测试因使用固定提示词，可能低估模型真实生成能力并引入偏见，导致某些模型被不公平地评估。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的提示词显著提升生成性能，揭示模型隐藏能力，并发现某些视觉概念（如空间关系和形状）优化效果更显著。

Conclusion: 固定基准测试可能低估模型真实能力，而ConceptMix++提供了更准确的评估方法，为未来开发提供洞察。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

Result: 在多种数据集、架构和分辨率下验证了{\pname}优于现有方法，且性能无损。

Conclusion: {\pname}提供了一种高效、无损的机器遗忘方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Result: 在Pascal VOC和Context数据集上，SemiOVS性能优于现有方法（如PrevMatch和SemiVL），提升3.5和3.0 mIoU。

Conclusion: SemiOVS能有效利用未标记OOD图像，为半监督语义分割任务提供新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Human-Animal-Cartoon等数据集上验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态域泛化性能，解决了模态间不一致问题。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多相机系统在自动驾驶和机器人环境感知中日益重要，但其传统全局SfM方法因优化框架问题而缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 采用解耦的旋转平均模块和混合平移平均模块，通过分层策略估计旋转，并结合相机间和相机到点的约束优化平移。

Result: 在大规模数据集上，系统在精度上匹配或超过增量SfM，同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 该框架优于现有全局SfM方法，为多相机SfM应用提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

Motivation: 解决将文本定义的作者写作风格转化为视觉表现的挑战，探索生成AI在创意辅助和跨模态理解中的应用。

Method: 利用AWS作为输入，通过LLM生成文本提示，再使用扩散模型生成图像，并通过人类评估验证效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉化作者风格提供了一种新方法，并初步验证了其有效性，未来可应用于创意辅助等领域。

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决源自由无监督域适应（SFUDA）中低质量原型样本和伪标签错误分配问题的方法，通过可靠样本记忆模块、多视图对比学习和噪声标签过滤技术，显著提升了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中隐私问题限制了敏感数据的访问，SFUDA无需目标域标签数据即可进行域适应，但原型样本质量低和伪标签分配错误是两大挑战。

Method: 方法分为三阶段：1）可靠样本记忆模块（RSM）提升原型样本质量；2）多视图对比学习（MVCL）增强伪标签质量；3）噪声标签过滤技术进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home和Office-31数据集上，分类准确率分别比次优方法和13种SOTA方法平均提升约2%和6%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键挑战，显著提升了域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Conclusion: MIMO为自动广告设计提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in
producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial
design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing
diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样样本，且动态卷积仅关注空间建模，忽略了时间动态和上下文依赖。

Method: 提出DESign框架，结合DCAC动态捕捉帧间运动线索，SR-CTC通过子网监督防止CTC过拟合。

Result: 在主流数据集（PHOENIX14等）上实现最优性能。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC有效提升CSLR的泛化能力和准确性，且SR-CTC无额外推理开销。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 优化核心组件与架构创新同样重要，论文提供了一套通用设计指南，为未来方法奠定基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Conclusion: MRC-DETR为PCB缺陷检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，并推动了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NCU的新框架，通过遗忘预训练视觉语言模型中的噪声对应关系，提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中噪声对应关系（NC）对性能的负面影响，避免从头训练的高资源消耗。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过学习最难的负样本信息，明确遗忘错误的正负样本，并通过最优传输目标快速微调。

Result: 在CLIP模型上验证，NCU在零样本迁移任务中表现优于现有方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU为预训练模型中的噪声问题提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Result: 在RadarScenes数据集的移动实例跟踪基准上，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合几何和外观特征，显著提升了稀疏雷达点云中的移动实例跟踪性能。

Abstract: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their
surroundings. The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for
reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this
estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QAA的新特征聚合技术，通过学习的查询作为参考码本，有效提升信息容量，无需显著增加计算或参数复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法通常在单一数据集上训练，导致数据集特定的归纳偏差和泛化能力受限。多数据集联合训练虽有望解决此问题，但数据集间的差异会限制特征聚合层的信息容量。

Method: 提出Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA)，利用学习的查询作为参考码本，通过计算查询级图像特征与参考码本之间的Cross-query Similarity (CS)生成鲁棒描述符。

Result: QAA在多个数据集上表现优于现有最优模型，实现了平衡的泛化能力，同时保持与数据集特定模型相当的峰值性能。

Conclusion: QAA通过创新的特征聚合技术解决了多数据集训练中的信息容量问题，展示了良好的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过随机多裁剪增强的方法，激活CLIP对局部特征的潜在分析能力，解决了其偏向全局图像模式的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程依赖粗粒度类别标签，忽略了细粒度局部语义，而现有方法假设VLMs能识别局部视觉细节，但实验表明CLIP对全局模式的偏向限制了其处理局部描述符的能力。

Method: 采用随机多裁剪增强技术，通过裁剪局部区域约束模型的感受野并重新校准其注意力机制。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够显著提升CLIP对局部视觉细节的处理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于毫米波雷达的场景流估计框架，利用视觉惯性传感器数据进行监督，解决了传统方法依赖昂贵LiDAR数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前毫米波雷达场景流估计依赖昂贵的3D LiDAR数据，而视觉惯性数据虽普及但无法直接监督3D运动。此外，视觉惯性数据的时漂问题也影响静态点的场景流估计。

Method: 提出了一种无漂移的刚性变换估计器，融合运动学模型与神经网络结果，并开发了光学-毫米波监督提取模块，结合光学与雷达测量约束动态点场景流。

Result: 在烟雾环境中，该方法甚至优于依赖昂贵LiDAR的现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过低成本传感器数据实现了高效的场景流估计，适用于智能车辆等场景。

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Result: 网络运行速度快于传感器帧率，单次扫描即可实现优于现有方法的移动物体分割。

Conclusion: 该方法为雷达点云移动物体分割提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

Conclusion: NRSeg有效利用合成数据，显著提升BEV语义分割性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/lynn-yu/NRSeg.

TL;DR: BiCD是一种专为变化检测设计的二值神经网络，通过增强表示能力和特征可分性，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二值化方法在变化检测中表现不佳，限制了网络的表示能力和区分能力，BiCD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于信息瓶颈原则的辅助目标，设计紧凑的可学习辅助模块，优化重建损失和变化检测损失。

Result: 在街景和遥感数据集上，BiCD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BiCD为基于二值神经网络的变化检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

Conclusion: DIVER通过结合强化学习和扩散生成，有效提升了自动驾驶系统的多样性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略在细粒度视频分类任务中表现优越，跨模态注意力是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an
accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces
Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to
estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver
monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures
synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture
through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using
a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block,
followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving
Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver
readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing
approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion.
As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models

featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，循环学习对无监督动作分割具有显著优势。

Conclusion: CLOT通过引入多级循环特征学习机制，显著提升了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了通用基础模型（如CLIP、BLIP、LLaVa、DINO）与领域特定人脸识别模型（如AdaFace、ArcFace）在人脸识别任务中的表现，发现领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优，但基础模型在提供上下文信息时表现提升，且融合两者能进一步提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用基础模型与领域特定模型在人脸识别任务中的性能差异，并研究如何结合两者以提高识别准确性和可解释性。

Method: 通过实验比较多种基础模型和领域特定模型在多个基准数据集上的表现，并尝试简单的分数级融合方法。

Result: 领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优；基础模型在提供上下文信息时性能提升；融合两者能显著提高低误匹配率下的识别准确性；基础模型还能为识别过程提供可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定模型和通用基础模型可以显著提高人脸识别任务的性能，尤其是在低误匹配率下，同时增强系统的可解释性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

Conclusion: 该工作为具身手势生成和多模态交互研究提供了重要资源和方法框架。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

Conclusion: 轻量级预训练模型结合优化和分类技术可有效提升脑卒中诊断效果。

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Result: 所有统计模型的调整R平方值均高于0.90，指标能准确反映摩擦变化。

Conclusion: 该图像指标成本低，适用于混合设计阶段的路面摩擦评估。

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的跨域和联合泛化性能。

Conclusion: SMoEStereo通过高效融合VFMs，显著提升了立体匹配的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的车载传感器可能被遮挡或视野受限，而路边基础设施感知系统可以提供互补信息，但传统3D检测算法在俯视角下泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用2.5D检测框架，通过检测地面平面的平行四边形来保留对象的平面位置、大小和方向，忽略高度。训练数据结合真实和合成场景。

Result: 实验表明该方法检测精度高，跨视角泛化能力强，且对光照和天气条件具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该2.5D检测框架为路边摄像头提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: ViFMs在科学应用中具有潜力，但需进一步开发通用性模型。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且可交互控制的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架，支持人机协作诊断。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR表示策略常忽略序列中的时空线索，限制了其效果。LiMA旨在利用长时程关联增强表示学习。

Method: LiMA包含三个关键模块：跨视图聚合、长时特征传播和跨序列记忆对齐，以高效整合多帧图像特征并保持一致性。

Result: 在主流LiDAR感知基准测试中，LiMA显著提升了语义分割和3D目标检测性能，且不影响下游任务效率。

Conclusion: LiMA为自动驾驶提供了更有效的预训练范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

TL;DR: ProtoMM是一种无需训练的多模态原型框架，通过结合文本和视觉特征改进预训练视觉语言模型在测试时的适应性，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注文本模态的原型学习，忽略了类名的模糊语义，导致原型无法充分捕捉视觉概念，性能受限。

Method: ProtoMM构建多模态原型，将原型视为文本描述和视觉粒子的离散分布，动态更新视觉粒子，并通过最优传输问题量化原型与测试图像的语义距离。

Result: 在15个零样本基准测试中，ProtoMM平均准确率提升1.03%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过多模态原型动态学习，显著提升了预训练视觉语言模型在测试时的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉嵌入模型能够捕捉连续、有序属性（称为“排名轴”），且仅需少量样本即可恢复有意义的排名轴。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉嵌入模型是否能够通过线性方向捕捉连续、有序属性，并验证其在实际数据集中的表现。

Method: 通过投影嵌入到定义的“排名轴”上，测试7种流行编码器和9个数据集，验证属性的顺序是否保留。

Result: 许多嵌入模型天生具备排名能力，仅需少量样本（甚至两个极端例子）即可恢复有意义的排名轴。

Conclusion: 研究为图像排名在向量数据库中的应用提供了新思路，并推动了对可排名嵌入结构的学习进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临数据复杂性、噪声标注和持续学习需求的挑战，现有模型难以直接适应。

Method: 提出SAMed-2模型，包含时间适配器和置信驱动记忆机制，用于捕捉图像相关性和存储高置信特征。

Result: 在内部基准和10个外部数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAMed-2为医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案，尤其在多任务场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10
external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at:

Motivation: 解决手语翻译中数据稀缺问题，并提升自动手语识别的词汇灵活性和准确性。

Method: 提取全局时空和手形特征，通过动态时间规整和余弦相似度匹配大规模手语词典，利用LLM进行上下文感知的消歧。

Result: 在合成和真实手语数据集上表现出更高的准确性和句子流畅性。

Conclusion: 展示了LLM在手语识别中的潜力，为无训练框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预跌倒检测系统虽准确率高，但侵入性强或计算资源需求高，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 利用摄像头视频数据，提取跌倒特征，设计简易LSTM网络模型。

Result: 计算需求降低18倍，准确率达88%。

Conclusion: 该系统适合工业和住宅安全领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

Motivation: 当前GUI代理从文本依赖转向纯视觉方法，但忽视了上下文建模的挑战，尤其是无关元素和高冗余历史信息的影响。

Method: 提出掩码元素剪枝方法减少无关元素干扰，设计一致性引导历史压缩模块优化历史信息处理。

Result: SimpAgent减少了27%的FLOPs，并在多样化的网页和移动环境中表现出优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: SimpAgent通过高效上下文建模，为GUI代理的性能和效率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

TL;DR: S3PO-GS是一种基于3D高斯溅射（3DGS）的RGB-only户外SLAM方法，解决了现有方法缺乏几何先验和尺度漂移的问题，通过自一致跟踪模块和动态映射模块提升了跟踪精度和场景重建质量。


<details>

Motivation: 现有3DGS SLAM方法在户外场景中缺乏几何先验或存在尺度漂移问题，限制了其性能和适用性。

Method: 提出自一致跟踪模块和基于补丁的动态映射模块，结合3DGS点图，避免累积误差并引入几何先验。

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上，S3PO-GS在视图合成和跟踪精度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS通过改进的模块设计，显著提升了户外3DGS SLAM的鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM)，通过Flow Matching任务作为锚点，解决了Continuous-time Consistency Models训练不稳定的问题，显著提升了生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs)在少步生成中效率高，但训练不稳定。作者认为这种不稳定性源于模型仅学习概率流的捷径，而忽略了定义流的瞬时速度场。

Method: 提出FACM，利用Flow Matching (FM)任务作为锚点，结合主CM捷径目标进行训练，无需修改模型架构。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，FACM仅用1步（NFE=1）和2步（NFE=2）分别达到FID 1.76和1.32，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACM为构建高性能少步生成模型提供了通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building
high-performance, few-step generative models. Our code and pretrained models:

Conclusion: ChestGPT作为辅助工具，可减轻放射科医生负担，提供初步诊断结果和病灶定位。

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Conclusion: StreamDiT支持实时应用，如流式生成和交互式生成，并通过定量和人工评估验证了其性能。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优精度，并在DSEC-Semantic数据集上能耗降低65%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合事件和帧数据，显著提升分割性能并降低能耗。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要大量计算资源，难以在私有数据或新模态上复现。本文旨在通过高效预训练策略解决这一问题。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强技术，优化ViT-B/16在ImageNet-1K上的预训练。

Result: 预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时在ImageNet-C上保持鲁棒性，线性探测性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案，并探索了数据课程和增强对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Motivation: 随着ViT在安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）中的普及，确保其在参数位翻转故障下的正确功能变得至关重要。

Result: 该方法显著提升了ViT模型对位翻转故障的鲁棒性，可靠性提高了三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该技术为零开销的容错解决方案，适用于安全关键应用中的ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

Conclusion: 该模型在保持图像生成质量的同时，增强了模型的可解释性，有助于理解提示词对图像的具体影响。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

### [104] [Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion of Visible and Near-infrared Images for Long-range Haze Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03893)
*Yi Li,Xiaoxiong Wang,Jiawei Wang,Yi Chang,Kai Cao,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种层次化语义-视觉融合（HSVF）框架，用于长距离去雾，结合近红外和可见光模态，通过双流协作恢复高对比度场景和丰富纹理细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾方法主要关注短距离场景，长距离去雾因散射增强和信号损失而未被充分探索。近红外模态具有更好的雾穿透能力，但现有方法常忽略可见光图像中的雾残留。

Method: 提出HSVF框架，包含语义流和视觉流。语义流通过对齐模态不变的内在表示获取抗雾语义预测，视觉流从近红外模态恢复结构细节。

Result: 实验表明，HSVF在真实长距离去雾任务中优于现有方法，生成高对比度场景和丰富纹理细节。

Conclusion: HSVF通过双流协作和模态互补，有效解决了长距离去雾问题，并提供了新的数据集支持研究。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果推理的表示学习算法，用于解决传感器数据中跨域人类活动识别（HAR）的分布偏移问题。通过设计双分支框架和独立性准则，有效分离因果与非因果特征，显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有领域泛化（DG）方法仅关注统计依赖性，忽略了内在因果机制的重要性。本文旨在通过因果推理解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了一个早期分叉的双分支框架，分别学习因果和非因果特征，并利用Hilbert-Schmidt信息准则进行特征解耦。此外，采用了非均匀域采样策略和类别感知域扰动层。

Result: 在多个公共HAR基准测试中，该方法显著优于11种现有方法，适用于跨人、跨数据集和跨位置场景。

Conclusion: 该方法通过因果机制有效解决了跨域HAR问题，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Result: 在Real3D-AD和Anomaly-ShapeNet数据集上，Object-level AUROC分别为79.9%和79.5%，Point-level AUROC分别为71.2%和84.7%。

Conclusion: DUS-Net通过保留几何结构和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了高精度点云重建和3D异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and
84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 通过技术创新，实现了高效、高质量、通用性强的人体动画生成，解决了性能和实用性挑战。

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLMs在放射学报告生成中更注重语言流畅性而非临床有效性，且难以捕捉X光图像与文本的关系，导致临床实用性差。

Method: OTDRG利用最优传输对齐图像特征与报告中的疾病标签，并通过对齐与微调模块缩小跨模态差距，同时设计了疾病预测模块。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上，OTDRG在自然语言生成（NLG）和临床效果（CE）指标上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OTDRG不仅生成语言连贯的报告，还能确保临床准确性，为放射学报告生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and
0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNF-Intrinsic通过改进输入和约束物理一致性，实现了更高质量的逆渲染。

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了偏置未对齐问题，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

Method: 使用英国Countryside Survey数据，评估CNN和ViT在监督和监督对比学习范式下的表现。

Result: ViT在分类指标上优于CNN（Top-3准确率91%，MCC=0.66），监督对比学习减少相似生境的误分类，模型表现与专家相当。

Conclusion: 结合AI与生态学专家知识，为地面生境监测提供了可扩展、低成本的框架，有助于生物多样性保护和土地利用决策。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)替代ViT中的MLPs，以解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。实验表明，KAN-based ViTs在知识保留和任务适应上优于传统MLP-based ViTs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题严重，尤其在ViT中使用MLPs时。研究旨在通过KANs的局部可塑性解决这一问题。

Method: 用KANs替换ViT中的MLPs，利用基于样条的激活函数实现局部参数更新，减少对已学知识的覆盖。

Result: KAN-based ViTs在MNIST和CIFAR100等数据集上显著减少了灾难性遗忘，表现优于传统MLP-based ViTs。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs的结合为动态环境中的模型提供了更强的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Motivation: 现有方法仅生成静态幻灯片或文本摘要，无法满足动态演示的需求。

Method: 采用模块化流程，包括文档分段、幻灯片视觉帧生成、上下文旁白生成及音视频同步。

Result: 在30个文档-演示对的数据集上，PresentAgent接近人类水平的质量。

Conclusion: 可控多模态代理在将静态文本转换为动态演示方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical

physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation
annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply
this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that
T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能提升显著（14%-23%）。

Conclusion: 结合视觉定位与探索对具身智能至关重要。

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial
information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next
in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce
\underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o
\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and
question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,
respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input
modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.
These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and
exploration for embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: DiffGRE通过合成数据和多阶段方法有效提升了在线类别发现的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Result: 在四个HMP基准数据集上的实验验证了TCL的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架能轻松集成到不同HMP模型中，适用于多种数据集和应用。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at
https://github.com/ghh1125/DOCTOR.

Conclusion: STAB和ACB结合AAA策略有效提升了动作预测的合理性和一致性。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at
https://hyqlat.github.io/STABACB.github.io/.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多目标跟踪中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，尤其适用于动态场景和目标分类需求。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

Motivation: 解决基于窗口的自注意力模型因感受野有限和计算复杂度高而难以扩展的问题。

Result: 实验表明，PromptSR在定量、定性和复杂度评估上优于现有轻量级SR方法。

Conclusion: PromptSR通过结合全局先验和局部细节，显著提升了性能，同时保持低计算成本。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at

Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative
Computing (EMC2), an optimal computing system designed for autonomous vehicles

of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal
representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data
bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to
ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a
end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM在可控性和语义一致性方面取得了显著进展，为开放式文本到图像生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: LVLM-Composer为可控且组合准确的开放式文本到图像生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the
indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations
confirm the perceptual superiority of our generated images. LVLM-Composer
represents a significant step towards truly controllable and compositionally
accurate open-ended text-to-image generation.

*Fengrui Tian,Tianjiao Ding,Jinqi Luo,Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出DynamicVoyager，通过将动态场景生成重新定义为场景外绘过程，解决了从单视图生成无界动态场景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景生成在增强/虚拟现实和机器人领域有广泛应用，但现有方法因依赖多视图训练而限制了生成场景的范围。

Method: 将单视图视频映射到动态点云，利用射线上下文进行视频外绘，生成3D一致的运动，并通过更新点云实现无界场景生成。

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成具有一致运动的无界场景，并可通过场景提示控制生成内容。

Conclusion: DynamicVoyager通过射线上下文和点云更新，实现了单视图下无界动态场景的高效生成。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from
a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and
robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need
to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过空间变化的增益和像素合并技术提升图像传感器的噪声性能和动态范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着像素尺寸减小，图像质量可能因光积累减少而下降，需平衡分辨率、噪声和动态范围。

Method: 采用空间变化的增益和像素合并策略，根据局部场景亮度优化噪声和动态范围。

Result: 动态范围扩展了一个数量级，数字合并在高增益下表现优于模拟合并。

Conclusion: 结合空间变化的增益和像素合并技术，可有效提升图像质量，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法在图像恢复任务中耗时较长，需要改进。

Method: 通过QBM从中间近似初始化加速去噪，并通过RRP调整噪声权重以增强随机性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和CelebA-HQ上验证，能有效加速且保持性能。

Conclusion: QBM和RRP显著提升效率，适用于多种图像恢复任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室小鼠在生物医学研究中至关重要，但复杂的非刚性形变和无纹理外观使得3D运动重建困难，且缺乏结构化3D数据集。

Method: 1. 构建高保真合成数据集；2. 采用基于Transformer的三平面表示架构；3. 引入地标嵌入提升重建稳定性。

Result: MoReMouse在精度和鲁棒性上显著优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: MoReMouse填补了小鼠3D重建领域的空白，为生物医学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

TL;DR: GSTDS算法通过动态调整训练数据子集，利用预训练模型和光谱分析，显著降低计算需求，同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化神经网络训练的数据选择，减少冗余计算，提升资源利用效率。

Method: 基于光谱分析和Fiedler向量评分机制，动态过滤数据点。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求降低4倍，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 光谱数据选择为高效深度学习提供了可扩展方案，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates

convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light
enhancement on resource-limited platforms.

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端设计和预训练视频模型的有效利用，显著提升了3D纹理生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了AI模型在专业领域深度跨模态推理的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

Result: 在各种生成任务上，MPQ-DMv2显著优于现有方法，尤其在极低位量化下表现突出。

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2为极低位扩散模型量化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

Motivation: 单域泛化（SDG）任务面临域偏移大和数据多样性有限的问题，现有方法依赖数据增强但难以适应大域偏移。

Method: 提出LEAwareSGD，利用LE测量动态调整学习率，使模型在混沌边缘训练，平衡稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上的实验显示，LEAwareSGD显著提升泛化能力，PACS上最高提升9.47%。

Conclusion: 在混沌边缘训练能有效增强SDG任务的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为DLCN的大规模夜间动态光照条件下rPPG数据集，填补了该领域数据集的空白，并分析了现有算法的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG算法在理想光照条件下表现良好，但在夜间动态光照环境中的效果未知，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 收集并发布DLCN数据集，包含98名参与者的13小时视频和生理信号数据，覆盖四种典型夜间光照场景。

Result: DLCN数据集具有高多样性和真实性，为评估算法在复杂条件下的鲁棒性提供了资源。

Conclusion: DLCN数据集和Happy-rPPG工具包的发布推动了夜间动态光照条件下rPPG研究的进展。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The
dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/dalaoplan/Happp-rPPG-Toolkit.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种端到端框架DMAT，通过结合3D Mamba结构和特征金字塔，同时改善大气湍流（AT）下的图像质量和目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致图像质量下降，影响目标检测和场景跟踪。现有深度学习方法在湍流条件下表现不佳，需要一种能同时优化图像质量和检测性能的解决方案。

Method: 使用3D Mamba结构处理时空扭曲和模糊，通过特征金字塔提取特征并传递给检测器，通过反向传播优化AT缓解器和检测器。

Result: DMAT在生成湍流的数据集上比现有方法性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT框架有效结合了AT缓解和目标检测，显著提升了湍流条件下的性能。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA方法独立提取图像和文本特征，忽略了CT数据的空间连续性和切片间相关性，导致回答碎片化且不精确。

Method: 构建跨模态图，将CT切片和问题标记作为节点，利用注意力图卷积网络动态融合信息，生成软提示指导LLM生成答案。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过图表示和LLM的结合，有效解决了医学VQA中的空间连续性挑战，提升了回答质量。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 首次证明纯Mamba块可实现高效密集全局融合，同时保证相机-LiDAR多模态3D目标检测的顶级性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合策略无法同时实现高效性、长距离建模和完整场景信息保留。

Method: 提出高度保真LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块，结合局部与全局上下文学习。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上取得75.0的NDS最高分，超越高分辨率输入方法，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过高度保真编码和混合Mamba块，实现了高效且高性能的多模态融合。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 墓碑作为历史文化载体面临保存挑战，需数字化手段改善内容解析与检索。

Method: 利用VLMs将墓碑图像转化为结构化表示（TMRs），并结合RAG增强语义解析。

Result: 解析准确率从传统OCR的36.1提升至89.5，并在多语言和文化背景下验证了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次将大型视觉语言模型应用于墓碑理解，为文化遗产保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于任务算术框架的方法，将自解释模型的视觉可解释性从源域迁移到目标域，提升目标域的解释质量而不牺牲分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自解释模型训练中高昂的标注和计算成本问题，通过迁移学习实现高效的可解释性。

Method: 基于视觉-语言预训练模型构建自解释模型，定义可解释性向量，并通过任务算术框架将其应用于目标域模型。

Result: 实验表明，可解释性可成功迁移至目标域，解释质量提升且分类准确性未受影响；ImageNet上学习的可解释性向量具有普适性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，单次推理的解释质量接近需要多次推理的Kernel SHAP。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Result: 实验结果表明，CoIBA显著提高了特征归因的忠实性。

Conclusion: CoIBA通过跨层共享信息，弥补了现有方法的不足，为决策过程提供了更全面的解释。

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

Motivation: 跨模态遥感图像注册面临非线性辐射变化和纹理限制的挑战，现有方法（如CNN和Transformer）在全局特征捕获或计算复杂度上存在不足。

Result: 在多种分辨率的CRSI上实验表明，RegistrationMamba在性能和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba通过全局与局部特征的有效结合，显著提升了跨模态遥感图像注册的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在合成的大规模3D城市数据集上验证，Sat2City从单张卫星图像生成高保真3D结构，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Sat2City为3D城市生成提供了高效解决方案，适用于游戏、数字孪生等应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计方法需要昂贵的3D监督且泛化性差，尤其在户外无界场景中表现不佳，因此需要更有效的正则化方法。

Method: 利用低层颜色特征和高层蒸馏特征计算视角一致分布，并通过采样施加隐式正则化，结合深度推进损失消除失败模式。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有NeRF变体和深度正则化方法。

Conclusion: 视角一致分布和深度推进损失联合提供有效正则化，显著提升了NeRF在新视角合成中的性能。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

Conclusion: MVNet展示了处理复杂高光谱图像数据的强大能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注食物类别，缺乏对多种食物属性（如甜度、重量等）的全面研究，且RGB相机难以准确感知这些属性。

Method: 通过整合现有数据集和收集数百种食物的高光谱图像，结合仪器实验测定食物属性，构建了包含3,266个食物类别和2,351k数据点的基准。

Result: 大规模模型在数字化食物方面表现不佳，食物成为最难研究的对象之一；光谱数据对分析食物属性至关重要。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并持续迭代，推动智能食物分析的发展。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在复杂场景中难以实现空间组合与输入文本的对齐，布局规划与生成过程脱节。

Method: CoT-Diff框架在单次扩散过程中集成MLLM驱动的3D布局规划，通过动态更新布局并转换为语义条件和深度图，利用条件感知注意力机制指导生成。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff通过紧密耦合布局规划与生成过程，验证了这种纠缠生成范式的有效性。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

TL;DR: BiVM是一种高效的二值化神经网络，用于实时视频抠图，通过弹性快捷路径和可进化拓扑结构提升编码器性能，并通过稀疏化解码器特征减少计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上的深度神经网络在实时视频抠图中存在计算限制，二值化虽为常见压缩方法，但存在精度和效率问题。

Method: 提出弹性快捷路径和可进化拓扑结构的二值化编码器，稀疏化解码器特征，并采用信息引导的局部二值化模仿框架。

Result: BiVM在计算和存储成本上分别节省14.3倍和21.6倍，性能优于现有二值化方法。

Conclusion: BiVM通过优化二值化网络结构和特征利用，显著提升了视频抠图的精度和效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练的情况下，实现了高效的个性化图像生成，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

Conclusion: MVL-Loc通过结合视觉语言模型和多模态数据，显著提升了多场景相机重定位的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的框架FA，通过强制提示学习充分利用ID知识，显著提升OOD检测效果，无需外部辅助数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法依赖外部数据或泛化能力有限，本研究旨在通过ID知识提升OOD检测效果。

Method: 学习一个强制提示，包含ID类的多样化描述，并通过强制系数优化提示学习。

Result: 实验表明FA在OOD检测中优于现有方法，且无需外部数据。

Conclusion: FA通过ID知识显著提升OOD检测效果，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据收集往往偏向常见场景和对象，导致新颖案例代表性不足，影响模型泛化能力和安全性。

Method: 使用动态Mean Shift算法为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性分数，基于均值和协方差统计建模正常内容，识别并丢弃冗余帧。

Result: 减少训练数据集大小可提高模型性能，而数据冗余增加时，更激进的过滤方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时部署，能持续更新正常内容的定义，高效检测连续数据流中的新颖性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive

introduces a state-of-the-art discrete video tokenizer with two key
contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder
architecture that overcomes the limitations of previous sequencebased
tokenizers. Second, we introduce a new quantization scheme, channel-split
quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在需要细粒度控制的编辑任务（如人脸编辑）中表现不佳，导致身份信息丢失或无关区域被修改。

Method: 通过正交约束解耦身份令牌与编辑属性，并使用对象掩码引导注意力图，实现局部编辑。

Result: 实验表明S$^2$Edit在定量和定性上优于现有方法，并展示了多种应用（如妆容迁移）。

Conclusion: S$^2$Edit在保持身份信息的同时实现了精确编辑，为扩散模型的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Conclusion: CVFusion通过多视图特征融合显著提升了4D雷达的3D物体检测性能，验证了其潜力。

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on
View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively. Our code will be made

Conclusion: VLM2Vec-V2为多模态嵌入学习提供了统一框架，为研究和实际应用中的可扩展表示学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在结合多个LoRA模型时，常因权重矩阵的无序修改导致内容与风格属性特征纠缠，影响效果。

Method: 通过QR分解，固定Q和R矩阵，仅训练额外的任务特定ΔR矩阵，减少参数并实现属性分离。

Result: 实验表明，QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中实现了更好的属性分离，参数效率更高。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效、解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的幻灯片级标签，且仅使用单一语言提示和基础余弦相似度，无法捕捉多层次视觉-语言关联。

Method: HiLa框架结合预训练特征提取器生成分层视觉特征，并通过最优提示学习（OPL）对齐多属性语言提示，同时引入跨级传播（CLP）和互对比学习（MCL）模块增强层次协作。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上验证了其SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉-语言协作显著提升了生存预测效果。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D视觉问答中的误导性标注问题，提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MODA的新型注意力机制，解决了多模态学习中的注意力缺陷问题，通过双模态空间映射和自适应掩码注意力提升了模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在整合多模态数据方面表现出色，但在需要细粒度认知和情感理解的高级任务中存在注意力缺陷问题。

Method: 提出MODA机制，采用‘对齐后修正’策略，将模态对齐与跨层令牌混合解耦，并通过自适应掩码注意力确保注意力分数的正确性。

Result: 在21个基准数据集上的实验验证了MODA在感知、认知和情感任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MODA通过改进的注意力机制显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Conclusion: UGG-ReID通过不确定性建模有效提升了多模态对象重识别的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: VectorLLM是一种多模态大型语言模型，用于直接从遥感图像中提取建筑物轮廓，通过点对点回归模拟人工标注过程，显著优于现有方法，并展示了强大的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建筑物轮廓提取方法依赖复杂的多阶段流程，限制了可扩展性和实际应用，因此需要一种更高效、直接的方法。

Method: VectorLLM结合视觉基础骨干、MLP连接器和LLM，利用可学习的位置嵌入增强空间理解能力，通过预训练、监督微调和偏好优化进行训练。

Result: 在WHU、WHU-Mix和CrowdAI数据集上，VectorLLM分别比现有方法提高了5.6 AP、7.1 AP和13.6 AP，并在未见过的对象上表现出色。

Conclusion: VectorLLM为遥感图像中的矢量提取提供了新范式，利用LLM的拓扑推理能力实现了高精度和卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVATAR提出了一种新的视频中心化音频-视觉定位（AVL）基准，包含四种场景，并提出了TAVLO模型，通过高分辨率时间建模实现精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注图像级音频-视觉关联，忽略了时间动态性，且假设场景过于简化（单一可见声源）。

Method: 提出了AVATAR基准和TAVLO模型，前者包含四种场景，后者通过高分辨率时间建模整合时间信息。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征和帧级映射而难以跟踪时间变化，TAVLO则实现了鲁棒且精确的对齐。

Conclusion: 时间动态性对AVL至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心化AVL设立了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了肖像阴影去除的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

Motivation: 视频信息量大且冗余，需全面理解视频以准确检索查询相关片段。

Method: 采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳对齐（ETA）预处理，结合部分无关拒绝优化（PIR-GRPO）微调。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试集上优于现有方法约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知强化显著提升了时间视频定位性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Conclusion: 通过简单而有效的机制，该方法成功解决了空间-时间权衡问题，为文本到视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙科标志点的准确检测对临床治疗至关重要，但手动标注耗时且存在主观差异，传统深度学习方法因数据稀缺和标注成本高而受限。

Method: GeoSapiens结合了Sapiens基础模型和新型几何损失函数，以捕捉解剖结构的几何关系。

Result: 在严格0.5 mm阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为牙科标志点检测提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Conclusion: NC-GCD框架有效解决了GCD中的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对ControlNets的新型数据投毒攻击方法，能够在无文本触发的情况下生成特定内容（如NSFW图像），揭示了开源ControlNets管道的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，因此需要研究其安全漏洞。

Method: 通过向数据集中注入毒化样本（将轻微触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW输出，同时保持正常提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，该方法实现了高攻击成功率，且毒化输入难以察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ControlNets的安全脆弱性，强调了数据净化和防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本文本到图像检索中的应用，特别是在制造业中的织物样本检索。通过自动标注流程生成两种文本描述，评估了三种模型的性能，发现结构化描述显著提升检索精度。

Motivation: 解决制造业中产品信息（视觉样本与文本描述配对）的跨模态检索问题，填补公开数据集的空白。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动生成自由形式和结构化文本描述，评估CLIP、LAION-CLIP和Meta的Perception Encoder三种模型的检索性能。

Result: 结构化描述显著提升检索精度，Perception Encoder表现最佳，但零样本检索在细粒度领域仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 结合技术性文本描述与先进VLMs可优化工业应用中的跨模态检索，需领域适应方法。

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

TL;DR: SalBench是一个新基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在检测人类明显视觉特征（如颜色、强度、方向）的能力。结果显示，LVLM在识别明显视觉异常方面表现不佳，GPT-4o准确率仅为47.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LVLM在低层次视觉特征（如颜色、强度、方向）上的能力，以衡量其与人类视觉注意力的对齐程度。

Method: 设计SalBench基准，包含三种任务（Odd-One-Out Detection、Referring Odd-One-Out、Visual Referring Odd-One-Out），用于测试LVLM的感知能力。

Result: LVLM在识别明显视觉异常方面表现不佳，GPT-4o准确率仅为47.6%。

Conclusion: SalBench揭示了LVLM在视觉感知方面的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要基准。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆向渲染的核心挑战是从2D观测中解耦几何、材料和光照。

Method: 通过联合优化三个神经组件：神经SDF表示几何、神经场预测PBR材料参数、MLP模型捕捉光照，结合物理可微渲染层和几何正则化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如DTU）上表现优于现有方法，提供可编辑和可重光照的资产。

Conclusion: 该方法在数字内容创作中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

Result: MCFormer显著优于现有方法，达到最低的NEPE。

Conclusion: 提供了基准数据集和先进方法，推动PIV研究发展。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小二乘图的多智能体3D LiDAR场景对抗噪声缓解框架，显著提升了对抗条件下的目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EdgeAI系统（如自动驾驶车辆）需要具备对抗威胁的鲁棒性，单智能体跟踪缺乏情境感知，多智能体合作能增强上下文理解和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用最小二乘图工具，通过差分坐标和锚点减少检测质心的位置误差，融合多车辆检测并分两阶段进行跟踪。

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上，该方法比现有单智能体和多智能体跟踪框架性能提升高达23.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外防御机制即可作为对抗威胁的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有方法将拓扑隐式嵌入几何特征中，导致冗余信息和高计算成本，需要一种更高效的方法。

Result: 在两个大规模无条件数据集和一个类别条件数据集上，训练和推理时间分别减少31.3%和56.3%，同时保持高质量CAD生成。

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式表示拓扑，有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Result: ArtBulb在定量和定性评估中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 研究旨在弥合法律与技术社区间的鸿沟，推动社会对AI艺术版权问题的关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常逐层一次性剪枝，可能导致精度损失较大。PCP旨在通过渐进式剪枝减少精度下降。

Method: PCP采用三步流程（尝试-选择-剪枝）迭代剪枝，并结合贪心策略选择剪枝层，还扩展到迁移学习场景。

Result: 在监督学习和迁移学习设置下，PCP在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP是一种简单有效的通道剪枝框架，显著减少了精度损失并适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Conclusion: PointGAC通过聚类中心对齐策略，提升了特征学习的通用性和效率。

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

Result: 在Pmi-GMA数据集上验证了模型在预测运动异常方面的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过显式建模不确定性，显著提升了自动化GMA的临床可靠性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Conclusion: 提出的可解释神经分析方法有效解决了视频长段落描述生成问题，并展示了作为自动教师的潜力。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，简化数据准备的同时达到先进水平。

Conclusion: RIPE为关键点提取提供了更高效、泛化性更强的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

Result: CMET在合成、生物和图像数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有低复杂度和稳定性。

Conclusion: CMET是一种可靠且高效的嵌入质量度量标准，适用于各种数据类型和规模。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable
out-of-the-box link predictior.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made
publicly available upon publication of this paper.

Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频基准过于关注生成质量和动作识别，缺乏对感知和认知能力的全面评估，且评估指标单一。

Method: 设计了HV-MMBench，包含15项任务、多种数据形式、多领域视频覆盖和不同时间长度，以全面评估模型。

Result: HV-MMBench提供了多样化的评估维度和数据形式，能够更准确地反映模型在人类中心视频理解中的表现。

Conclusion: HV-MMBench填补了现有基准的空白，为多模态大语言模型在人类中心视频理解中的研究提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工标注的无人机图像进行灾害区域识别，耗时且易出错。自监督特征可提供更高效、可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出两种编码器-解码器分割方法，结合DINOv2的视觉特征与传统编码器主干，评估自监督特征在航拍图像中的泛化能力。

Result: DINOv2的自监督预训练特征可迁移至航拍图像，显著减少对标注数据的依赖，实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: 自监督特征为航拍图像分割提供了高效且通用的解决方案，减少了人工标注的需求。

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于地球系统模型（ESM）在局部风险评估中分辨率不足，深度学习超分辨率模型成为解决方案，但需针对不同地理区域重新训练，且高分辨率数据分布不均，因此需评估模型的地理泛化能力。

Method: 引入RainShift数据集和基准，评估包括GAN和扩散模型在内的先进降尺度方法在南北半球数据差异下的泛化表现。

Result: 模型在分布外区域性能显著下降，扩展训练域虽能改善泛化，但不足以应对地理差异；数据对齐等方法可提升空间泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究推动了降尺度方法的全球适用性，减少高分辨率气候信息获取的不平等。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

TL;DR: ReLoop是一种闭环训练框架，通过多模态一致性反馈机制减少MLLMs中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在开放视觉问答中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，即输出与输入语义矛盾或失真，影响可靠性。现有方法依赖外部验证或后处理，缺乏训练中的内部验证机制。

Method: 提出ReLoop框架，采用环形结构，集成语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督三个一致性反馈模块，强制模型在训练中自我修正。

Result: 实验证明ReLoop能显著降低多个基准测试中的幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了一种有效的内部验证和修正方法，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

*Jianjiang Yang,Ziyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知启发的方法，将文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的“幻觉”重新解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并引入Alignment Risk Code（ARC）和TensionModulator（TM-ARC）来量化和干预生成过程中的对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在“幻觉”问题，即生成内容与提示语义的微妙或显著偏离。作者认为这些失败反映了生成过程中更深层次的结构性错位。

Method: 论文提出了一种认知启发的视角，将幻觉重新解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并引入了Hallucination Tri-Space和ARC来量化实时对齐张力。基于此，开发了TM-ARC控制器，用于在采样过程中进行针对性干预。

Result: 在标准T2I基准测试中，TM-ARC显著减少了幻觉，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解基于扩散的T2I系统中的生成失败提供了一种统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Motivation: 解决现有掩码AR模型因分词器限制在质量和效率上落后于扩散模型的问题。

Method: 提出DC-HT分词器，实现32倍空间压缩比，并基于此扩展MaskGIT，构建混合掩码自回归框架。

Result: 在MJHQ-30K上gFID为5.49，GenEval得分0.69，吞吐量提高1.5-7.9倍，延迟降低2.0-3.5倍。

Conclusion: DC-AR在图像生成质量和效率上均达到领先水平。

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了虚假相关性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click通过交互式设计和对象级特征对齐，显著提升了视频到音频生成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Result: 实验表明，InterGSEdit在3DGS编辑中实现了最先进的性能，提供了一致且高保真的编辑效果。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式设计和几何一致性优化，显著提升了3D编辑的质量和用户体验。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Conclusion: 对齐可回答性框架有效提升了Video-LLMs在实际应用中的实用性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

TL;DR: TLB-VFI是一种高效的视频帧插值方法，通过3D小波门控和时间感知自编码器提取时间信息，显著提升了性能并减少了参数和训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频帧插值方法存在效率低或模型过大问题，需要一种兼顾性能和效率的解决方案。

Method: 提出TLB-VFI，结合3D小波门控和时间感知自编码器提取时间信息，并引入光流指导以减少训练数据和参数。

Result: 在最具挑战性的数据集上FID提升20%，参数减少3倍，速度提升2.3倍，训练数据需求减少9000倍。

Conclusion: TLB-VFI在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为视频帧插值提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are
available at our project page: https://zonglinl.github.io/tlbvfi_page.

TL;DR: OPAL是一种人类辅助标注方法，通过混合整数线性规划（MILP）最小化标注工作量，同时达到高精度目标。在测试视觉系统时，OPAL在准确性和减少人工标注方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习（DL）中准确标注数据的稀缺性是一个主要挑战，尤其是在测试时需要接近完美的标签精度。

Method: 提出OPAL方法，采用MILP优化标注工作量，并引入主动学习循环进一步减少人工标注。

Result: OPAL在七大数据集上平均准确率达98.8%，减少人工标注50%以上，并在自动验证任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OPAL通过MILP和主动学习的结合，显著提升了标注效率和准确性，适用于深度学习测试任务。

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

Motivation: CVS识别在腹腔镜胆囊切除术中至关重要，但传统方法依赖高成本的空间标注，且现有多模态模型在零样本评估中表现不佳。

Method: 提出CVS-AdaptNet，通过正负提示对齐图像嵌入与文本描述，增强多标签分类性能。

Conclusion: 多标签多模态框架结合文本提示显著提升CVS识别性能，展示了通用模型适应专业手术任务的潜力。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt为手术计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，首次将SPML应用于多任务数据整合。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Method: 结合稀疏点云和RGB图像，利用合成数据集训练深度估计模型，增强现有数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人任务中的质量估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在生成响应时可能出现与视觉内容不一致的幻觉现象，而人类认知中很少出现此类问题。作者认为这是因为人类能有效利用多模态交互信息。

Method: 提出INTER算法，通过显式引导LVLM在生成响应时重新应用多模态交互信息的理解，从而减少幻觉。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INTER在五种LVLM上平均提升了3.4%，优于现有解码策略。

Conclusion: INTER是一种无需额外数据的训练免费方法，能有效减少LVLM的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 生物医学数据集通常存在样本不平衡和隐私限制，阻碍了机器学习模型的开发。合成图像可以改善数据可用性并保护隐私。

Method: 使用LoRA权重微调的稳定扩散模型生成合成图像，并结合少量真实样本指导分类器训练。

Conclusion: 合成图像是生物医学研究中克服数据限制、提升模型泛化能力的有效工具。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Conclusion: MoDiT显著提升了音频驱动说话头生成的质量和真实感。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

Conclusion: AutoHDR在历史文档修复领域取得了重要进展，为文化遗产保护提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D捕获系统帧率低，直接重建高速运动会导致不理想结果，需解决这一问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于同步捕获，实现了等效100-200 FPS的高质量重建。

Conclusion: 通过异步捕获和生成模型，无需高速相机即可实现高质量高速4D重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Motivation: 社交网络在危机事件中能提供多模态数据，但如何从噪声数据中提取有效信息并整合异构数据仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 结合预训练VLMs、丰富文本描述和自适应融合策略，能显著提升多模态危机数据分类性能。

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧插值任务局限于少量帧和固定帧数生成，缺乏文本控制和官方定义。本文旨在解决这些问题，提出更灵活的SFI任务。

Method: 基于Wan2.1构建SemFi模型，引入Mixture-of-LoRA模块，确保多帧长度限制下的高一致性和控制条件对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SemFi模型在SFI-300K数据集上表现优异，满足SFI任务的多维度需求。

Conclusion: SemFi模型和SFI-300K数据集为语义帧插值任务提供了有效的解决方案和评估基准。

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and
materials science communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遥感方法难以应对破碎农业景观的时空异质性，因此需要一种适应性强的监测方法。

Method: 采用物候驱动的分类框架，针对32个地区进行本地化校准，结合遥感与地面数据。

Result: 整体准确率达93.3%，较传统方法提升8.0个百分点，验证了与官方数据的高度一致性（R^2 = 0.981）。

Conclusion: 研究证明，遥感框架需适应而非简化景观复杂性，为区域化农业监测提供了科学且实用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

Result: 在语义、实例和全景分割任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D理解提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

Motivation: 深度学习模型在分布变化时性能下降，TTT虽有效但需专用架构。CTA旨在通过跨任务对齐提升TTT的通用性和鲁棒性。

Method: CTA通过多模态对比学习对齐监督与自监督编码器，避免梯度干扰并保留自监督学习的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示CTA在多个基准数据集上显著提升了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CTA为TTT提供了一种无需专用架构的有效方法，显著提升了模型在分布变化下的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 在低帧率无人机视频中，目标外观和位置的快速变化以及图像质量下降使得多目标跟踪变得复杂。

Result: 该方法对干扰物和检测间隙具有鲁棒性，且在降低图像分辨率和潜在表示大小时仍保持高关联质量。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在军事车辆数据集上表现优异，为实际战斗场景中的多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology
(IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in

Conclusion: 该方法为多领域信号分离问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Result: 模型OVR在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，如MATH500（95.3%）、MathVision（51.8%）和MathVerse（54.6%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了行为转移的早期现象，并通过强化学习优化视觉行为，推动了多模态推理模型的发展。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Motivation: 现有基于Consistency Distillation（CD）的方法因自一致性和跨一致性不平衡导致条件引导不当，生成结果不理想。

Method: 提出SegmentDreamer框架，采用SCTD重新定义自一致性和跨一致性关系，并将PF-ODE轨迹分段以确保一致性。

Result: 实验表明SegmentDreamer在视觉质量上优于现有方法，支持高保真3D资产生成。

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过SCTD有效解决了CD方法的局限性，实现了高质量的文本到3D生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Result: 在REA数据集上，ST-LLM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ST-LLM为解决MLLMs的时空理解问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced

preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing
model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Motivation: 深度神经策略在嵌入式微控制器上的应用受到内存和实时性限制，而二阶剪枝方法虽能高效压缩网络，但其对闭环稳定性、跟踪精度和安全性的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析剪枝后的权重矩阵变化，推导出剪枝策略与原始策略之间的误差界限，并提出了一个依赖于未剪枝谱范数和偏置的常数C_k(s)。

Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive
grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their
millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of
embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain
Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the
recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local
Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite
their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal
on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.
We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of
second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves
under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer
multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.
Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$,
producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$
and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state
$s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,
and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived
bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning
magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking
second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our
work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the
robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合人类手势模型的梯度优化方法，用于生成机器人绘画的自然轨迹。


<details>

Result: 生成可行机器人轨迹，应用于合成涂鸦和图像抽象。

Conclusion: 方法提升了机器人绘画的自然性和协作潜力。

Abstract: Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable
rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that
can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the
intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually
executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important
for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and
more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that
bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like
motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use
the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that
enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG)
renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible
trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a
minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation
and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.

Abstract: Replicating human--level dexterity remains a fundamental robotics challenge,
requiring integrated solutions from mechatronic design to the control of high

relies on the quality of human demonstration data. We bridge this gap with a
hand--arm teleoperation system featuring: (1) a 20--DoF linkage--driven
anthropomorphic robotic hand for biomimetic dexterity, and (2) an
optimization--based motion retargeting for real--time, high--fidelity
reproduction of intricate human hand motions and seamless hand--arm
coordination. We validate the system via extensive empirical evaluations,
including dexterous in-hand manipulation tasks and a long--horizon task
requiring the organization of a cluttered makeup table randomly populated with
nine objects. Experimental results demonstrate its intuitive teleoperation
interface with real--time control and the ability to generate high--quality
demonstration data. Please refer to the accompanying video for further details.

Conclusion: 该方法在微控制器上实现了高性能实时MPC，并在27g微型四旋翼上成功测试，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of
first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have
excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these
approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their
adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order
Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also
their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online
hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks,
achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized
fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache
recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2)
complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on
a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation
open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.

Abstract: The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for
airspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable
motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods
focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on
forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection
to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised
vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of
drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone
trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with
camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We
then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a
self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our
method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that
feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban
scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised
image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction,
reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D
labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for
real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance
to support reproducible research in the robotics community.

Result: UniKF在多种噪声水平下优于基线方法，定位和方向误差降低3倍，维度估计误差降低2倍，精度和召回率接近完美（99.5%-100%）。

Conclusion: UniKF是一种高效的多源融合算法，显著提升了感知性能。

Abstract: Reliable multi-source fusion is crucial for robust perception in autonomous
systems. However, evaluating fusion performance independently of detection
errors remains challenging. This work introduces a systematic evaluation
framework that injects controlled noise into ground-truth bounding boxes to
isolate the fusion process. We then propose Unified Kalman Fusion (UniKF), a
late-fusion algorithm based on Kalman filtering to merge Bird's Eye View (BEV)
detections while handling synchronization issues. Experiments show that UniKF
outperforms baseline methods across various noise levels, achieving up to 3x
lower object's positioning and orientation errors and 2x lower dimension
estimation errors, while maintaining nearperfect precision and recall between
99.5% and 100%.

Abstract: Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic
ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a
multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging
the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial
robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter
using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of
two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while
reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint
of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner
to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive
behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing
rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is
controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope
as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments,
demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how
the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation.
Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of
our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the
potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic
environments.

Motivation: 传统推进系统在近距离操作中可能导致传感器污染等问题，而磁场相互作用控制可以避免这些问题。然而，传统磁场模型在近距离操作中精度不足，可能导致卫星碰撞。

Result: 在目标卫星和追逐卫星的对接模拟中，该方法显著降低了精确磁场模型的计算成本，并展示了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了近距离卫星操作的磁场计算问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the
exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an
increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.

leverages deep neural networks to identify efficient nonlinear embeddings of

Motivation: 解决机器人装配中复杂非凸几何体和高精度间隙的挑战，避免因位姿估计不准确导致的卡顿和损坏。

Method: 通过原始运动在线构建接触状态子流形，并映射到离线接触流形进行精确位姿估计。

Result: 在0.1至1.0毫米间隙的工业相关几何体上，成功率96.7%，比无状态估计方法提升6倍，且显著降低力和时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过精确位姿估计，实现了更安全、高效的机器人装配。

Abstract: Robotic assembly of complex, non-convex geometries with tight clearances
remains a challenging problem, demanding precise state estimation for
successful insertion. In this work, we propose a novel framework that relies
solely on contact states to estimate the full SE(3) pose of a peg relative to a
hole. Our method constructs an online submanifold of contact states through
primitive motions with just 6 seconds of online execution, subsequently mapping
it to an offline contact manifold for precise pose estimation. We demonstrate
that without such state estimation, robots risk jamming and excessive force
application, potentially causing damage. We evaluate our approach on five
industrially relevant, complex geometries with 0.1 to 1.0 mm clearances,
achieving a 96.7% success rate - a 6x improvement over primitive-based
insertion without state estimation. Additionally, we analyze insertion forces,
and overall insertion times, showing our method significantly reduces the
average wrench, enabling safer and more efficient assembly.

Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning have shown promising results in
robotic manipulation, driven by the availability of high-quality training data.
To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing
specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use
human hand demonstrations to obtain training data.However, the former requires
both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the
latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand
demonstrations and the deployed robot observations.To address this, we propose
a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper
generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper
demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap.Specifically, a GoPro
fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand
demonstrations.We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of
paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed
using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both
timestamps and observations.Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we
are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate
them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation
pipeline for training robotic policy model.In experiments, the robust
manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated
robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data
collection method.More demonstrations can be found at: https://rwor.github.io/

Abstract: Modular robotics holds immense potential for space exploration, where
reliability, repairability, and reusability are critical for cost-effective
missions. Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision
tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot
interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in
monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for
synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting
dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design
makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To
ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained
within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric
can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control,
deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible
with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for
Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination
(available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated
by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs,
evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external
disturbances.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques enable robots to learn and
generalize tasks from user demonstrations, eliminating the need for coding
expertise among end-users. One established technique to implement LfD in robots
is to encode demonstrations in a stable Dynamical System (DS). However, finding
a stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear
matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on
the number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant
computational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as
floating-point errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
compositional approach that enhances the applicability and scalability of
learning stable DSs with BMIs.

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM system with 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which is the first to jointly consider visual quality,
geometric accuracy, and real-time performance. It robustly and accurately
estimates poses while building a photo-realistic 3D Gaussian map in real time
that enables high-quality novel view RGB and depth rendering. To effectively
address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a
lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance
cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth
completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas,
significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To
enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise
Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed
CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally
reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly
incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the
continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose
estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream
applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame
interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we
construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth
poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence
novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected
datasets demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our system across LiDAR
sensors with varying sampling densities. Both the dataset and code will be made
publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.

Result: 在四足和六足机器人上的实验表明，ROLT在未见动态条件和噪声下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ROLT在少量动态设置下训练即可泛化到多种未见条件，且能处理测试中的噪声。

Abstract: To succeed in the real world, robots must deal with situations that differ
from those seen during training. Those out-of-distribution situations for
legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here
we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While
previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation
techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our
approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT),a variation of transformer,could
achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key
designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports
knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of
the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy's
robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on
quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than
existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned
policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally,
despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging
corruption noise during testing.

enabling easier adaptability. While significant work has been presented in the
context of learning navigation policies, learning-based methods are rarely
compared to traditional navigation methods directly, which is a problem for
their ultimate acceptance in general navigation contexts. In this work, we
explore the viability of imitation learning (IL) for indoor navigation, using
expert (joystick) demonstrations to train various navigation policy networks
based on RGB images, LiDAR, and a combination of both, and we compare our IL
approach to a traditional potential field-based navigation method. We evaluate
the approach on a physical mobile robot platform equipped with a 2D LiDAR and a
camera in an indoor university environment. Our multimodal model demonstrates
superior navigation capabilities in most scenarios, but faces challenges in
dynamic environments, likely due to limited diversity in the demonstrations.
Nevertheless, the ability to learn directly from data and generalise across
layouts suggests that IL can be a practical navigation approach, and
potentially a useful initialisation strategy for subsequent lifelong learning.

Motivation: 受人类行走时手臂摆动调节全身动态的启发，研究如何通过手臂运动改善机器人的平衡和运动性能。

Method: 采用分散的演员-集中评论家结构，手臂和腿部分别训练，共享基础状态和角动量观测，通过模块化奖励设计实现任务相关行为。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效减少角动量并提升平衡性，在多种运动任务中表现优于单智能体和其他多智能体基线。

Conclusion: 该框架成功部署于真实人形机器人，展示了在复杂地形中的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body
dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this
principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots
through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic
structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but
decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular
momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant
behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking
and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum
and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during
locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with
single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a
humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion
tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair
climbing.

Conclusion: 沉浸式VR在精准农业中具有提升效率和精确性的潜力，但需注意模拟逼真度和通用性的限制。

Abstract: This study explores the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) as a control
interface for agricultural robots in vineyard disease detection and treatment.
Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an
immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During
the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed.
However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others,
completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized
path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38%
faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks,
immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study
highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting
limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that
immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in
precision agriculture.

*Abhijeet Behera,Sogol Kharrazi,Erik Frisk,Maytheewat Aramrattana*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种改进的TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法，分别加入了车辆航向信息、适应铰接式车辆以及允许恒定加速度，并在CARLA仿真环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法假设车辆航向相同且不变，且未考虑铰接式车辆和速度变化，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 开发了三种改进版本：1) 加入航向信息；2) 适应铰接式车辆；3) 允许恒定加速度。在CARLA仿真中测试。

Result: 改进方法不仅能检测追尾碰撞，还能识别侧碰风险，优于传统TTC。

Conclusion: 改进的TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法扩展了应用场景，提升了碰撞预测能力。

Abstract: Time-to-collision (TTC) is a widely used measure for estimating the time
until a rear-end collision between two vehicles, assuming both maintain
constant speeds and headings in the prediction horizon. To also capture
sideswipe collisions, a two-dimensional extension, TTC$_{\text{2D}}$, was
introduced. However, this formulation assumes both vehicles have the same
heading and that their headings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in
addition to the standard assumptions on the prediction horizon. Moreover, its
use for articulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This
paper addresses these limitations by developing three enhanced versions of
TTC$_{\text{2D}}$. The first incorporates vehicle heading information, which is
missing in the original formulation. The standard assumption of constant speed
and heading in the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts this to
articulated vehicles while retaining the assumptions of the first version. The
third version maintains the constant heading assumption but relaxes the
constant speed assumption by allowing constant acceleration. The versions are
tested in a cut-in scenario using the CARLA simulation environment. They detect
rear-end collisions, similar to TTC, and moreover, they also identify sideswipe
risks, something TTC could not predict.

Conclusion: 集成显式运动学模型的强化学习方法有效解决了局部最优问题，提升了四足机器人配备机械臂的运动与操作性能。

Abstract: Equipping quadruped robots with manipulators provides unique
loco-manipulation capabilities, enabling diverse practical applications. This
integration creates a more complex system that has increased difficulties in
modeling and control. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution
to address these challenges by learning optimal control policies through
interaction. Nevertheless, RL methods often struggle with local optima when
exploring large solution spaces for motion and manipulation tasks. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates an explicit
kinematic model of the manipulator into the RL framework. This integration
provides feedback on the mapping of the body postures to the manipulator's
workspace, guiding the RL exploration process and effectively mitigating the
local optima issue. Our algorithm has been successfully deployed on a
DeepRobotics X20 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this
approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种考虑导线交叉的三维导线排列优化方法，通过多目标黑盒优化确保导线不交叉并提供足够的关节扭矩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的导线排列设计依赖经验，复杂结构下难以实现，现有研究常简化问题（如限制2D平面或忽略导线交叉），因此需要更全面的优化方法。

Method: 采用多目标黑盒优化方法，优化三维导线排列，确保导线不交叉且沿目标轨迹提供足够关节扭矩。

Result: 在三维链接结构下优化导线排列，验证了方法的有效性，并讨论了设计解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了复杂结构下导线排列的挑战，为机器人设计提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

Result: 双臂系统效率接近单臂的两倍，吞吐量提高10-20%，且停止次数显著减少。

Conclusion: 优化调度方法显著提升了植物工厂中机器人采摘的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Plant factory cultivation is widely recognized for its ability to optimize
resource use and boost crop yields. To further increase the efficiency in these
environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework
that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks,
minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations.
Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ
pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability.
Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with
that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly
double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides.
Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant
reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These
results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in
improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant
factories.

Method: 采用Soft-Braid Attention捕捉轨迹间的时空拓扑关系，并结合车道交互建模，通过多轮迭代细化轨迹。

Result: 在两个数据集上显著优于四种基线方法，达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: SRefiner通过引入拓扑关系显著提升了轨迹预测精度，为自动驾驶系统提供了更安全的决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of multi-agent future trajectories is crucial for
autonomous driving systems to make safe and efficient decisions. Trajectory
refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological
relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction
precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement
approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological
structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention
captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by
considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft
intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model
interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction
accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively
refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance
interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant
performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement. Code is here

TL;DR: AutoLayout提出了一种双系统框架，通过慢速系统（RRG管道）和快速系统（离散坐标生成与验证）结合，以及LLM自适应关系库（ARL），有效解决了布局生成中的空间幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局生成方法存在空间幻觉问题，如物体漂浮、重叠或堆叠关系错误，需平衡语义保真度和物理合理性。

Method: AutoLayout采用双系统框架：慢速系统通过RRG管道提取对象属性和空间约束；快速系统生成坐标和拓扑关系，并通过ARL验证。

Result: 在8个场景中验证，AutoLayout在物理合理性、语义一致性和功能完整性上比SOTA方法提升10.1%。

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过闭环自验证和双系统协作，显著提升了布局生成的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Motivation: 高速地面机器人在非结构化地形运动时产生的高频振动会导致LiDAR扫描失真，现有方法难以准确高效地解决这一问题。

Method: 建模线性与角振动引起的去失真误差，为每个点分配后去失真不确定性，并利用该不确定性指导点对图匹配和状态更新。

Result: 在振动平台和移动平台实验中，该方法在LiDAR经历强烈振动时表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的后去失真不确定性方法有效提升了LIO在高频振动环境下的性能。

Abstract: High-speed ground robots moving on unstructured terrains generate intense
high-frequency vibrations, leading to LiDAR scan distortions in Lidar-inertial
odometry (LIO). Accurate and efficient undistortion is extremely challenging
due to (1) rapid and non-smooth state changes during intense vibrations and (2)
unpredictable IMU noise coupled with a limited IMU sampling frequency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces post-undistortion uncertainty. First,
we model the undistortion errors caused by linear and angular vibrations and
assign post-undistortion uncertainty to each point. We then leverage this
uncertainty to guide point-to-map matching, compute uncertainty-aware
residuals, and update the odometry states using an iterated Kalman filter. We
conduct vibration-platform and mobile-platform experiments on multiple public
datasets as well as our own recordings, demonstrating that our method achieves
better performance than other methods when LiDAR undergoes intense vibration.

Method: 通过最小化不同相机事件密度分布的差异确定时间差，调整时间戳实现同步。

Result: 实验显示该方法在多种场景和相机模型下同步误差小于10ms。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多事件相机的时间同步问题，无需额外硬件支持。

Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of sensor designed for capturing the dynamic
changes of a scene. Due to factors such as trigger and transmission delays, a
time offset exists in the data collected by multiple event cameras, leading to
inaccurate information fusion. Thus, the collected data needs to be
synchronized to overcome any potential time offset issue. Hardware
synchronization methods require additional circuits, while certain models of
event cameras (e.g., CeleX5) do not support hardware synchronization.
Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware-free event camera synchronization
method. This method determines differences between start times by minimizing
the dissimilarity of the event density distributions of different event cameras
and synchronizes the data by adjusting timestamps. The experiments demonstrate
that the method's synchronization error is less than 10ms under various senses
with multiple models of event cameras.

Abstract: Lidar technology has been widely employed across various applications, such
as robot localization in GNSS-denied environments and 3D reconstruction. Recent
advancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective
solid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its
dome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable
performance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,
such as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars
significantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across
platforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state
and high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently
examined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.
  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from
multiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped
Mid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.
Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively
includes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state
and spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark
evaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor
data. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud
registration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and
hybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar
systems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for
future research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar
platforms.

Abstract: Policy learning focuses on devising strategies for agents in embodied
artificial intelligence systems to perform optimal actions based on their
perceived states. One of the key challenges in policy learning involves
handling complex, long-horizon tasks that require managing extensive sequences
of actions and observations with multiple modes. Wavelet analysis offers
significant advantages in signal processing, notably in decomposing signals at
multiple scales to capture both global trends and fine-grained details. In this
work, we introduce a novel wavelet policy learning framework that utilizes
wavelet transformations to enhance policy learning. Our approach leverages
learnable multi-scale wavelet decomposition to facilitate detailed observation
analysis and robust action planning over extended sequences. We detail the
design and implementation of our wavelet policy, which incorporates lifting
schemes for effective multi-resolution analysis and action generation. This
framework is evaluated across multiple complex scenarios, including robotic
manipulation, self-driving, and multi-robot collaboration, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method in improving the precision and reliability of the
learned policy.

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and safe brain
stimulation procedure with growing applications in clinical treatments and
neuroscience research. However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged
sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with
conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising
solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing
interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been
notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of
Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration,
neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art
technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future
research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of
Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high
operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging
technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration,
learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS),
and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to
address these challenges.

Conclusion: VA-MPPI框架展示了在非结构化和遮挡环境中实现鲁棒导航的潜力，为自主地面车辆系统的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Navigating complex, cluttered, and unstructured environments that are a
priori unknown presents significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles,
particularly when operating with a limited field of view(FOV) resulting in
frequent occlusion and unobserved space. This paper introduces a novel
visibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated
as a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions
are intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a
unified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
explicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances
exploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance
would be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against
deterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a
cluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results
demonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision
with unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example,
in the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller
achieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic
controller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria
rather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids
unobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed
framework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in
unstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements
in autonomous ground vehicle systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在实际应用中具有高效性和实用性，F1TENTH车辆评估验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational
efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is
computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may
compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and
safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models.
Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve
notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free
characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can
safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free
trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the
generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed,
which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and
control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen
scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while
maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle
further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world
applications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, operating in environments with relatively few
obstacles, offer high maneuverability and full three-dimensional mobility. This
allows them to rapidly approach objects and perform a wide range of tasks often
challenging for ground robots, making them ideal for exploration, inspection,
aerial imaging, and everyday assistance. In this paper, we introduce AirStar, a
UAV-centric embodied platform that turns a UAV into an intelligent aerial
assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental
understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural
interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote
controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial
knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for
fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate
vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also
offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering,
intelligent filming, and target tracking. With a highly extensible framework,
it supports seamless integration of new functionalities, paving the way toward
a general-purpose, instruction-driven intelligent UAV agent. The supplementary

Abstract: Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a
longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement
learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in
real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world
faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and
significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a
safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection,
while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated
using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a
novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and
real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we
first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,
which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values
using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived
from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from
the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive
experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation
tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly
improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope
this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on
leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic
RL.

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人操作中表现优异，但在长时程任务和图像噪声下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: VLM-TDP显著提升了扩散策略在长时程任务和噪声环境下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in
short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence
of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided
trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon
manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art
vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,
manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based
trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial
conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and
substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned
Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration
data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation
experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms
classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success
rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in
performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or
altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world
experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in
long-horizon tasks. Videos are available on https://youtu.be/g0T6h32OSC8

Conclusion: 重置步骤应纳入高性能算法，手性选择不影响IEKF性能。

Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state
estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman
Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine
systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial
navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed
respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these
filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match
handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this
paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right-
IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the
handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is
properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the
IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves
asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be
included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation
system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of
the two filters.

Conclusion: IDAGC框架推动了人机协作的全面发展。

Abstract: In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which encompasses physical interaction
and remote cooperation, accurate estimation of human intentions and seamless
switching of collaboration modes to adjust robot behavior remain paramount
challenges. To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive
Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and
human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across
multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of
collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework
overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically
restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and
transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive
model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and
robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By
employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted
features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns
multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent
estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our
framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of
HRC.

Conclusion: PRISM在复杂密集场景中展现了强大的鲁棒性，代码和演示已开源。

Abstract: Robust imitation learning for robot manipulation requires comprehensive 3D
perception, yet many existing methods struggle in cluttered environments. Fixed
camera view approaches are vulnerable to perspective changes, and 3D point
cloud techniques often limit themselves to keyframes predictions, reducing
their efficacy in dynamic, contact-intensive tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose PRISM, designed as an end-to-end framework that directly
learns from raw point cloud observations and robot states, eliminating the need
for pretrained models or external datasets. PRISM comprises three main
components: a segmentation embedding unit that partitions the raw point cloud
into distinct object clusters and encodes local geometric details; a
cross-attention component that merges these visual features with processed
robot joint states to highlight relevant targets; and a diffusion module that
translates the fused representation into smooth robot actions. With training on
100 demonstrations per task, PRISM surpasses both 2D and 3D baseline policies
in accuracy and efficiency within our simulated environments, demonstrating
strong robustness in complex, object-dense scenarios. Code and some demos are

Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to
operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional
approaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps
simultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ
human-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to
navigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high
computational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to
unseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans
perceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments.
Specifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent
essential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are
hybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features,
so-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit
local frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph.
Lastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring
Random Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the
topological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab
environments. We open our source code at

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks (DRAE), a
groundbreaking architecture that addresses the challenges of lifelong learning,
catastrophic forgetting, and task adaptation by combining the dynamic routing
capabilities of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); leveraging the knowledge-enhancement
power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); incorporating a novel
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework; and coordinating through
ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima (RSHO).DRAE dynamically routes expert
models via a sparse MoE gating mechanism, enabling efficient resource
allocation while leveraging external knowledge through parametric retrieval
(P-RAG) to augment the learning process. We propose a new RL framework with
ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning,
and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation
and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly
outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge
reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic
robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models.
Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable,

precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for
traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social
context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments.
This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances
traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We
evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the

Conclusion: 相对反馈是一种高效的人类指导形式，结合离策略强化学习可显著提升性能，适用于实际任务。

Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement
learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations
or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information
content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,
relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to
the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved
performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual
comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation
without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of
domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high
computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we
propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent
framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes
in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to
establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before
each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to
update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to
generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This
approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery
capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks,
demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We
believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also
contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website:

environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Result: 在静态杂乱场景中，系统显著提高了操作安全性且不影响任务效率。

Conclusion: 该系统有效解决了遥操作中的碰撞问题，提升了操作安全性。

Abstract: Teleoperating precise bimanual manipulations in cluttered environments is
challenging for operators, who often struggle with limited spatial perception
and difficulty estimating distances between target objects, the robot's body,
obstacles, and the surrounding environment. To address these challenges, local
robot perception and control should assist the operator during teleoperation.
In this work, we introduce a safe teleoperation system that enhances operator
control by preventing collisions in cluttered environments through the
combination of immersive VR control and voice-activated collision avoidance.
Using HTC Vive controllers, operators directly control a bimanual mobile
manipulator, while spoken commands such as "avoid the yellow tool" trigger
visual grounding and segmentation to build 3D obstacle meshes. These meshes are
integrated into a whole-body controller to actively prevent collisions during
teleoperation. Experiments in static, cluttered scenes demonstrate that our
system significantly improves operational safety without compromising task
efficiency.

Conclusion: 被动形状变量在非完整系统运动中可产生多稳态周期解，为机器人运动控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of many under-actuated wheeled platforms are governed
by nonholonomic constraints of no-skid for passively rolling wheels, coupled
with momentum balance. In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e.
joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering
angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model
where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor
attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to
rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes
multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as
stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as
well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We
use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under
symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further
scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for
symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the
symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and
structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with
numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape
variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic
systems of robotic locomotion.

Conclusion: 系统成功实现了高效、低成本的视觉监控和物体地理定位。

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了检测的自动化水平和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are critical in the automated inspection of
wind turbine blades. Nevertheless, several issues persist in this domain.
Firstly, existing inspection platforms encounter challenges in meeting the
demands of automated inspection tasks and scenarios. Moreover, current blade
stop angle estimation methods are vulnerable to environmental factors,
restricting their robustness. Additionally, there is an absence of real-time
blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment during capture, where lost details
cannot be restored through post-optimization. To address these challenges, we
introduce a platform and two approaches. Initially, a UAV inspection platform
is presented to meet the automated inspection requirements. Subsequently, a
Fermat point based blade stop angle estimation approach is introduced,
achieving higher precision and success rates. Finally, we propose a blade
detail prioritized exposure adjustment approach to ensure appropriate
brightness and preserve details during image capture. Extensive tests,
comprising over 120 flights across 10 wind turbine models in 5 operational wind
farms, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing
inspection autonomy.

Result: 实验证明TTTS在逆运动学、避障运动规划等任务中高效，能够快速收敛到全局最优解。

Conclusion: TTTS通过张量分解显著提升了优化效率，适用于广泛的机器人任务。

Abstract: Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal
control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems
involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and
long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art
optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying
scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to
achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration
across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However,
MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and
high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train
Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the
separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank,
linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation
time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the
bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across
inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion
planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of
TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.

Conclusion: 数据集设计对轨迹预测模型性能至关重要，但现代架构对复杂特征的依赖较低，跨数据集和地理多样性的影响需进一步研究。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,
yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied.
This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset
transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in
multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4
Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the
US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to
the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset
experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred
between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: The specification and validation of robotics applications require bridging
the gap between formulating requirements and systematic testing. This often
involves manual and error-prone tasks that become more complex as requirements,
design, and implementation evolve. To address this challenge systematically, we
propose extending behaviour-driven development (BDD) to define and verify
acceptance criteria for robotic systems. In this context, we use
domain-specific modelling and represent composable BDD models as knowledge
graphs for robust querying and manipulation, facilitating the generation of
executable testing models. A domain-specific language helps to efficiently
specify robotic acceptance criteria. We explore the potential for automated
generation and execution of acceptance tests through a software architecture
that integrates a BDD framework, Isaac Sim, and model transformations, focusing
on acceptance criteria for pick-and-place applications. We tested this
architecture with an existing pick-and-place implementation and evaluated the
execution results, which shows how this application behaves and fails
differently when tested against variations of the agent and environment. This
research advances the rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems,
contributing to their reliability and trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型依赖文本输入，难以适应现实世界的变化和失败。

Method: LERa通过三个步骤（Look、Explain、Replan）利用视觉反馈进行重新规划，仅需原始RGB图像、自然语言指令、初始任务计划和失败检测。

Result: 在ALFRED-ChaOS和VirtualHome-ChaOS数据集上，LERa在动态环境中表现优于基线40%；在PyBullet模拟器中，任务成功率提升67%。

Conclusion: LERa是一种鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，适用于机器人任务执行中的错误感知。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning,
but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world
changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look,
Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that
utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB
image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure
detection - without additional information such as object detection or
predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The
replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a
scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides
corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly.
LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from
both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the
newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40%
improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation
tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet
simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments,
including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's
effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable
solution for error-aware task execution in robotics. The code is available at

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.

Motivation: 随着智能电表的普及，能源盗窃检测成为关键挑战。现有AI模型虽有效但计算和能耗高，限制了实用性，尤其是在低盗窃场景中。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级预过滤机制（看门狗机制），仅在可疑情况下激活LSTM模型，减少不必要的计算和能耗。

Conclusion: 该机制为智能电网提供了一种高效、可持续的能源盗窃检测方案，强调实际部署的可行性和可扩展性。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

*Haoran Zhang,Mingyuan Zhou,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的扩散框架，用于可控生成结构化生物空间数据，通过层次特征注入和通道注意力机制改进现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型对低维输入（如RGB图像）依赖简单条件机制，无法处理高维多通道生物数据的空间对齐和通道间依赖关系。

Method: 采用层次特征注入机制和通道注意力机制，结合随机掩码策略训练模型，以支持灵活的条件生成和缺失通道重建。

Result: 在空间和非空间预测任务中表现优异，包括蛋白质填充和基因到蛋白质预测，并能泛化到未见过的条件配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物空间数据的生成建模提供了高效且灵活的方法，显著提升了性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品真实性、标签错误和掺假问题，提供快速、非侵入性的检测方法。

Method: 使用便携式NIRS采集光谱数据，结合PCA和多种ML模型（如LDA、SVM、随机森林等）进行分析。

Result: 随机森林模型ROC AUC最高（0.8826），SVM次之（0.8747）。NN模型召回率最高（0.7804）。

Conclusion: NIRS与ML结合是检测肉类真实性的可靠方法，对打击食品欺诈有重要意义。

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
domains, but their effectiveness in time series forecasting remains
understudied. This work empirically examines whether pre-trained large-scale
time series models (LSTSMs) trained on diverse datasets can outperform
traditional non-pretrained small-scale transformers in forecasting tasks. We
analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained universal time series models (e.g.,
Moirai, TimeGPT) alongside conventional transformers, evaluating accuracy,
computational efficiency, and interpretability across multiple benchmarks. Our
findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing
insights into their suitability for time series tasks compared to task-specific
small-scale architectures. The results highlight scenarios where pretraining
offers advantages and where simpler models remain competitive.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双曲核图融合（HKGF）框架，用于分析多模态神经影像数据，以捕捉脑网络的分层结构，并在神经认知衰退预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多在欧几里得空间中融合多模态神经影像数据，无法有效捕捉脑网络的分层结构，因此需要一种新的方法来更好地分析神经认知衰退。

Method: HKGF框架包括多模态图构建模块、双曲核图神经网络（HKGNNs）模块、跨模态耦合模块和双曲神经网络预测模块，旨在在双曲空间中编码脑图以捕捉局部和全局依赖关系。

Result: 在超过4,000名受试者的实验中，HKGF在神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HKGF是一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，能够客观量化与神经认知衰退相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

*Aoming Liu,Reuben Tan,Boqing Gong,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSOP是一种数据驱动的方法，通过直接修剪操作而非token来减少VLM的计算冗余，实现高效性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLM token修剪方法存在操作冗余问题，无法区分关键操作与冗余操作。

Method: GSOP将VLM解码器计算分解为三个维度的原子操作，通过贪心排序确定修剪顺序，适应不同计算预算。

Result: GSOP减少70%计算，仅损失4%性能，跨任务和VLM保持18%性能优势。

Conclusion: GSOP在效率和性能上优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程强化学习中，设计有效的任务序列是关键，但现有方法依赖真实的因果结构，这在大多数RL场景中不现实。

Method: 提出CP-DRL框架，通过交互数据近似任务间的因果差异，结合任务新颖性和奖励增益形成统一目标。

Result: 在Point Mass基准测试中表现优于现有方法，收敛更快且回报更高；在Bipedal Walker-Trivial中方差更小，Infeasible变体中性能最佳。

Conclusion: 利用任务间的因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率，CP-DRL为这一方向提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of
our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

Motivation: 压缩广泛使用的自监督学习语音基础模型HuBERT，同时避免现有蒸馏方法依赖层间和特征映射的局限性。

Method: 利用HuBERT的迭代自蒸馏机制，直接用学生模型替换原始模型，使用相同的自监督学习目标进行训练。

Result: 在SUPERB基准测试中，DiceHuBERT显著优于现有方法，音素识别性能提升21%，ASR性能提升14%，并在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT通过简化蒸馏过程，显著提升了性能，展示了其在语音任务中的明显优势。

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

Motivation: 解决多因素问题中的结构复杂性和多重共线性，特别是在碳排放分析中，提供一种客观且可操作的方法。

Method: 使用DBSCAN进行无监督学习聚类，结合Elastic Net回归进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业的能源消耗数据（2000-2019），识别出16个类别，并定量评估了排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架具有全球适用性，能识别主要排放源并提供可操作见解，同时指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Motivation: BNNs在安全关键应用中具有潜力，但现有分析方法存在可扩展性和可信性问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 设计了一种原生表示BNN约束的求解器和近似模型计数器，并开发了专门的证明生成和检查流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定性验证中速度提升9倍，定量验证中提升218倍，覆盖率分别达到99%和86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为BNNs的可信验证提供了高效且全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

TL;DR: Echo State Transformers (EST) 是一种结合Transformer注意力机制和储层计算原理的混合架构，解决了标准Transformer的二次复杂度问题，并在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在大脑认知任务处理和数据效率方面存在不足，且序列处理的二次复杂度限制了其效率。

Method: EST通过固定大小的分布式记忆系统结合储层计算，引入可训练的储层参数，动态调整记忆与非线性之间的权衡。

Result: 在STREAM基准测试的12个任务中，EST在8个任务上优于GRU、LSTM和Transformer。

Conclusion: EST是GRU和LSTM的有效替代方案，并在资源受限和低数据场景下补充标准Transformer。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,

learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge

Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持灵活集成新工具和模型。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Motivation: 解决分子预训练模型无法捕捉专家隐性推理的问题，将化学家知识融入预测模型。

Method: 使用ChatGPT模拟化学家推理，生成知识表示，并通过门控交叉注意力机制与分子图特征融合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有模型，如FreeSolv的RMSE降低15.0%，BACE的AUROC提升5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy提供了一种灵活、可推广的药物发现方法，支持真实化学家输入，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial
environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or
time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures,
leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著简化了现有解决方案，并能轻松泛化到多种图结构。

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Conclusion: SDKD框架能有效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时减少计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Result: 多头注意力在特定条件下能协同增强信息传播，提高混合时间和极小极大保真度。

Conclusion: 多头注意力在理论和实验上均表现出优于单头注意力的性能。

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

TL;DR: InvisibleInk是一个基于LLM的长文本生成框架，通过差分隐私保护敏感信息，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM生成长文本时，如何安全地融入私有信息是一个关键问题。

Method: 通过隔离和裁剪敏感信息，以及从私有令牌的小超集中采样，实现差分隐私。

Result: 计算成本降低8倍，生成的长文本与非私有生成相比成本不到10倍。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk高效且隐私安全，适用于长文本生成。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Conclusion: 为最大化LLMs在科学内容总结中的价值，需开发能准确检索和生成实时证据的系统。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,
checkpoints, and datasets are available at

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展罕见疾病患者的识别和分层，为临床和研究提供支持。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage

work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和经验必要性三个层面的论证，证明通用逼近器的表达力与不稳定性密不可分。

Result: 完美对齐是数学上不可能的，需重新思考如何在不可控性下安全操作。

Conclusion: 研究结果将UAT安全问题从“如何实现完美控制”转向“如何在不可控性下安全操作”，对UAT发展和治理有深远影响。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

### [336] [Adaptive Cubic Regularized Second-Order Latent Factor Analysis Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03036)
*Jialiang Wang,Junzhou Wang,Xin Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ACRSLF的自适应立方正则化二阶潜在因子分析模型，用于解决高维不完整数据建模中的非凸优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整数据在现实应用中普遍存在，但现有二阶潜在因子模型因目标函数的双线性和非凸性，需要复杂的参数调整和阻尼项处理。

Method: ACRSLF采用自调谐立方正则化和多Hessian-向量乘积评估，以动态缓解非凸优化不稳定性和精确吸收二阶信息。

Result: 在两个工业数据集上的实验表明，ACRSLF比现有基于优化器的LFA模型收敛更快且表示精度更高。

Conclusion: ACRSLF通过自适应立方正则化和精确二阶信息处理，显著提升了高维不完整数据的建模性能。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

TL;DR: Optimas是一个统一框架，用于优化复合AI系统，通过局部奖励函数（LRF）实现组件独立优化，提升全局性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合AI系统（如结合大语言模型和传统机器学习模型）在复杂任务中应用广泛，但其优化因非可微结构和多样化配置而困难。

Method: Optimas为每个组件维护一个局部奖励函数（LRF），确保局部奖励与全局性能对齐，并通过迭代优化LRF实现独立配置更新。

Result: 在五个实际复合系统中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas为复合系统提供了一种通用且高效的优化方法。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Result: 证明灾难性遗忘是优化方法的固有缺陷，世界建模方法能避免此类问题。

Conclusion: AI领域需超越机器学习，探索其他方法以实现人工认知。

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

Method: 引入一种规范语言建模常见公平性属性，构建监控器实时评估系统公平性，并提供统计误差界限。

Result: 监控算法在实验中表现高效，每次观察后更新判决时间小于1毫秒。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了8:16半结构化稀疏方法，其在性能上超越压缩阈值，同时保持存储效率，并通过结构化稀疏模式处理异常权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）规模增长，高效的压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）变得至关重要。现有结构化稀疏方法（如N:M稀疏化）因灵活性不足和对异常权重的敏感性而表现不佳。

Method: 提出8:16半结构化稀疏方法，结合稀疏结构化模式处理异常权重，并采用方差校正和权重均衡等简单技术提升性能。

Result: 8:16稀疏化在性能上超越压缩阈值，存储效率优于2:4稀疏化（0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/元素），且结构化稀疏对异常权重的处理效果与无结构化方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏方法在性能和存储效率上表现优异，结合简单技术可进一步提升稀疏模型的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Result: 元学习模型在二元分类任务中优于VLLMs，但在三元分类任务中VLLMs略优。

Conclusion: VLLMs表现有潜力，但可靠性和实用性需进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于数据收集方法限制（如低频GPS采样或CDR数据）导致的移动数据稀疏性问题。

Method: 采用类似BERT的掩码语言建模目标和自注意力机制，结合空间嵌入、时间嵌入和上下文背景特征（如人口统计和锚点）。

Result: 在乌干达坎帕拉的CDR和GPS数据集上显著优于传统模型（如马尔可夫链、KNN、RNN和LSTM）。

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建详细且连续的移动轨迹，提升对人类移动模式的理解。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine（C²HM），通过目标驱动的非对称推理过程改进了传统Helmholtz Machine的局限性，支持更高效的表示和记忆链推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Helmholtz Machine（HM）依赖对称的数据驱动更新，限制了其目标导向推理和时间扩展过程的能力。

Method: C²HM将推理重新定义为基于目标驱动的非对称过程，通过前向生成和逆向细化的循环一致性框架，结合变分循环实现目标条件预测与识别重建的对齐。

Result: C²HM提高了表示效率，支持路径依赖推理的记忆链，并实现了空间组合想象。

Conclusion: C²HM为生成建模提供了一种生物启发的替代方案，将记忆规划和无监督学习统一在一个概率框架中。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决强化学习中策略在新环境中可能因代理目标与设计目标不一致而导致的误泛化问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较了最大期望值（MEV）和最小最大期望遗憾（MMER）两种目标的效果。

Result: 研究发现MEV目标可能导致误泛化，而MMER目标更稳健；实验验证了MEV方法在网格世界环境中的误泛化现象。

Conclusion: 最小最大期望遗憾（MMER）是缓解目标误泛化的有效方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像常面临从未见过的动态，且测量数据稀疏、噪声大，需要一种模型无关的方法来重建复杂动态。

Result: 在风速场重建和等离子体演化恢复两个实际应用中，NeuralDMD表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一种通用工具，适用于地球科学、天文学等领域的动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法通常仅支持显式或隐式关系，且缺乏对结构模式的复用，限制了搜索效率。

Method: SymMatika结合多岛遗传编程和可重用模式库，通过反馈驱动进化引擎和隐式导数度量支持显式和隐式关系发现。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SymMatika表现优异，性能提升5.1%，首次恢复Nguyen-12，并在Feynman方程上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 结构感知的进化搜索对科学发现具有强大潜力，SymMatika已开源以支持更广泛的符号发现研究。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Conclusion: BLaST通过降低能耗、内存占用和延迟，推动下一代大规模AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Conclusion: LLMs的自信机制解释了其固执和对批评的过度敏感，为理解其行为提供了机制性解释。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGCA是一种混合CPU-GPU注意力机制，通过结合GPU上的密集注意力和CPU上的稀疏注意力，实现了高效的大语言模型推理，同时保持接近全注意力的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理中GPU内存受限的问题，尤其是长上下文生成所需的键值缓存（KV caches）占用过多内存，同时避免现有方法对CPU计算资源的低效利用和准确性损失。

Method: HGCA在GPU内存中保留最近生成的KV条目进行密集注意力计算，同时在CPU内存中对选定的重要KV条目进行并行稀疏注意力计算，并通过log-sum-exp融合高效合并结果。

Result: HGCA在多种模型和任务中表现出卓越的可扩展性，支持更长的序列和更大的批量大小，并在性能和准确性上优于现有的稀疏注意力基线。

Conclusion: HGCA是一种无需重新训练模型的解决方案，能够在普通GPU硬件上实现高效且高质量的大语言模型推理。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

TL;DR: 论文提出PiCME框架，通过对比学习整合多种临床数据，优化多模态预测性能，并引入模态门控LSTM解决多模态性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态深度学习在临床预测中有潜力，但现有对比学习方法在临床应用中局限于图像和文本对，需扩展至更多数据类型。

Method: 提出PiCME框架，预训练26种两到五模态组合的对比模型，并引入模态门控LSTM动态加权各模态重要性。

Result: 对比模型在三模态下表现优异，五模态时性能下降，但模态门控LSTM显著提升AUROC和AUPRC。

Conclusion: PiCME首次在MIMIC数据上实现全模态对比学习，为模态选择、训练策略和公平预测提供指导。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

Motivation: 当前AI视觉系统与人类视觉存在显著差异，如过度依赖纹理特征、对图像失真和对抗攻击的脆弱性。论文旨在通过模拟人类视觉发展过程来缩小这一差距。

Method: 通过整合心理物理学和神经生理学研究，设计了一种人类视觉发展模型（DVD），并将其应用于AI视觉系统的训练。

Result: 该方法在形状识别、抗图像干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优异，甚至优于参数更多、数据量更大的基础模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化学习方式而非单纯增加学习量，可以实现更高效、更接近人类视觉的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Conclusion: LaTF通过联合优化表示学习和生成建模，成功捕捉系统的慢自由度并准确生成平衡分布，为复杂分子系统的热力学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

Motivation: 解决零阶优化（ZO）在多百亿参数模型上的内存和计算吞吐量限制，提升分布式环境下的训练效率。

Method: 引入三种并行策略（PertP、DDP和2D并行）及硬件感知通信策略，优化参数卸载和GPU间通信。

Result: 在OPT-175B上，DistZO2比ZO2实现了3倍的加速。

Conclusion: DistZO2成功扩展了零阶微调的应用范围，同时保持了内存效率，并显著提升了训练吞吐量。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

Motivation: 动态路由模型在深度学习中的效率与多样性不足，神经抑制可能改善这一问题。

Method: 引入神经抑制算法，抑制共享信号，使路由模型为每个数据样本选择专用路径。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升通用任务性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型中值得深入研究的方向。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

Motivation: 传统的信息追求(IP)方法因难以准确估计互信息或条件熵而导致查询选择不优，影响预测效果。本文旨在通过基于共形预测集的方法改进不确定性估计。

Method: 提出C-IP方法，利用共形预测集与条件熵之间的关系，通过平均预测集大小来估计不确定性，从而优化查询策略。

Result: 在20 Questions和MediQ数据集上的实验表明，C-IP在预测性能和查询效率上优于传统IP方法，并在医疗交互场景中表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: C-IP是一种分布无关且鲁棒的不确定性测量方法，能够显著提升交互式问答任务的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Motivation: 填补Sentinel-5P产品中的数据空缺，特别是在云层遮挡等复杂情况下，提升数据完整性和准确性。

Method: 采用基于CP分解和交替最小二乘法（ALS）的低秩张量模型（LRTM）进行数据填补，并与地理统计学的空间插值方法对比。

Result: 低秩张量模型成功重建了S5P-TN产品中的缺失值，尤其在云层遮挡等复杂情况下表现优异，并能预测异常值和识别热点区域。

Conclusion: 低秩张量模型为动态大气变量的数据填补提供了一种有效方法，特别适用于大规模时空数据。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

Conclusion: GVI-DA在理论和实践上均表现出色，优于扩散生成框架。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

Motivation: 大语言模型的参数规模巨大，压缩技术成为研究热点，但现有方法通常采用统一的压缩比例，忽视了不同权重矩阵对模型性能的差异性影响。

Method: MGAA方法包含两部分：1) 在不同子层间基于输入输出余弦相似度分配压缩比例；2) 在子层内基于能量分布特性分配压缩比例。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和多模态模型LLaVA上的实验表明，MGAA显著提升了压缩效率和性能。

Conclusion: MGAA是一种高效且通用的压缩方法，适用于大语言模型和多模态模型。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

Result: 在Procgen游戏中，Dyn-O直接从像素观测中学习对象中心世界模型，预测精度优于DreamerV3。

Conclusion: Dyn-O在复杂环境中表现出色，通过特征分离实现了更精细的特征操作和多样化的轨迹生成。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal填补了现有方法的不足，为不规则采样时间序列的因果发现提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

*Alexander Gräfe,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MPX是一个为JAX设计的混合精度训练工具箱，旨在简化并加速大规模神经网络的训练，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JAX目前缺乏对混合精度训练的稳健支持，而混合精度训练已成为提升神经网络训练效率的重要工具。

Method: MPX通过将输入和输出转换为半精度，并引入动态损失缩放机制，解决了半精度计算中常见的梯度下溢和溢出问题。它还继承了JAX的类型提升行为，确保操作在正确的精度下进行。

Result: MPX能够无缝集成到现有的JAX训练流程中，并提供了自动创建和管理混合精度梯度与优化器的封装器。

Conclusion: MPX是一个高效且易于使用的混合精度训练工具箱，适用于JAX用户，其源代码和文档已公开。

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source
code, documentation, and usage examples are available at
github.com/Data-Science-in-Mechanical-Engineering/mixed_precision_for_JAX.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现中的结构-活性关系（SAR）建模面临数据有限和分子微小变化对性质敏感的挑战，需要更准确且可解释的模型。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力作为软注意力的一种高效近似，尤其在长序列中表现突出。然而，现有方法固定所有注意力层的特征维度，忽略了不同层的多样性和复杂性。

Method: 利用统计自由度概念自动确定特征维度，并提出分层训练策略学习非线性特征。理论分析了近似误差边界。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在固定计算预算下实现了更小的近似误差，提升了蒸馏模型的性能，且未增加推理成本。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅优化了线性注意力的特征维度选择，还揭示了注意力机制在不同层中的复杂性演变。

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in sequential

policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness
and safety in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the robustness
of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

Result: 论文系统性地介绍了各类学习问题中的评估指标，填补了现有指南的不足。

Conclusion: 该综述为从业者提供了选择合适评估指标的工具，提升了模型评估和跨模型比较的能力。

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Conclusion: $z$-变换方法在推导渐近结果方面具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and
related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle
to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across

demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further

Method: 通过选择合适的辅助起始状态分布，并利用安全性概念（如回合长度）指导分布选择。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的困难探索环境中实现了最先进的样本效率。

Conclusion: 辅助起始状态分布和安全性概念的结合显著提升了学习效率。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Conclusion: 结合形状信息的混合方法可增强分子表示，为分子机器学习任务提供新方向。

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

Programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure that simplifies the
implementation, modification, and evaluation of new algorithms. ObjectRL lowers
the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.

Result: 实验证明MAFG能有效自动化特征生成并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MAFG为科学数据特征生成提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Conclusion: 展望了由这种模型支持的物理、代理和嵌套（PAN）AGI系统的未来。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Result: 训练速度提升高达23%，在复杂模型（如MoE）中效果显著，计算资源大幅减少。

Conclusion: RLRS是一种简单、有效且可扩展的方法，适用于大规模神经网络优化。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Motivation: 晶体材料的生成建模面临对称性和多模态数据的挑战，特别是分数坐标在超环面上的处理需要特殊方法。

Result: 在晶体结构预测和从头生成任务中，KLDM表现优异，与当前最先进模型竞争。

Conclusion: KLDM为晶体材料生成提供了一种有效方法，解决了对称性和多模态数据的挑战。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 在高风险应用中，需要可靠的个体治疗效果估计，包括准确的点预测和可解释的不确定性量化。

Method: 采用因子化的蒙特卡洛Dropout框架，将总预测方差分解为共享编码器中的表示不确定性（sigma_rep）和结果头中的预测不确定性（sigma_pred）。

Result: 在三种合成协变量偏移情况下，区间校准良好（ECE < 0.03），且满足sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2。在真实世界双胞胎队列中，sigma_rep在分布外样本中显著增加，成为主要误差预测指标。

Conclusion: 模块级分解为深度因果效应模型中的不确定性来源检测和解释提供了实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Conclusion: PEM-UDE为构建多尺度脑模型提供了新途径，连接了微观神经元动态和宏观脑活动。

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source

Conclusion: 神经算子架构设计应反映物理耦合强度，以实现高效准确的替代模型。

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

Conclusion: 结论强调了LLMs对齐机制的脆弱性，并呼吁开发更鲁棒的微调策略以保持跨领域的安全性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Motivation: 早期科技初创企业依赖外部资金，但天使投资决策主观且资源密集。现有CFA工具虽准确但效率低，限制了广泛应用。研究旨在通过AI解决这一问题。

Method: 使用多个LLMs对600份初创企业融资路演文本进行CFA因素提取，并训练机器学习分类模型，以LLM生成的CFA分数为输入特征。

Conclusion: AI与CFA框架结合提供了可扩展、可靠且无偏的初创企业评估模型，解决了传统工具的局限性。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff为VLSI设计流程提供了高效且准确的有效电容建模方法。

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the

TL;DR: 论文提出IMPACT框架，通过重要性感知的激活重建优化低秩压缩，显著减少LLM模型大小同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在资源受限环境中部署困难，传统低秩权重压缩假设不适用于LLM，而激活的低秩结构更显著。

Method: 提出IMPACT框架，结合激活结构和梯度敏感性，通过重要性加权激活协方差矩阵的特征向量优化低秩重建。

Result: 实验显示IMPACT在多种模型和任务中，模型大小减少高达48.6%，准确性优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IMPACT通过重要性感知的激活重建，为LLM压缩提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架MatRL，用于自动发现计算矩阵函数的迭代算法，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索优化算法序列和步长，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迭代方法参数调优复杂，现代计算环境中存在多种迭代变体，手动优化性能困难。

Method: 将算法设计视为序列决策问题，利用蒙特卡洛树搜索规划混合迭代序列和步长。

Result: MatRL生成的算法在相同分布的矩阵上具有泛化能力，并在实验中优于文献中的基线方法。

Conclusion: MatRL为矩阵函数计算提供了一种高效的自动化算法设计方法，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决eGNN在预测材料电子结构时因密集连接图导致的内存不足问题。

Method: 采用分布式eGNN实现，利用GPU直接通信和图分区策略减少嵌入交换。

Result: 在Alps超级计算机上，实现了128 GPU的强扩展和512 GPU的弱扩展，并行效率达87%。

Conclusion: 分布式eGNN方法有效支持大规模电子结构预测，适用于复杂材料系统。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出通过降低ICD-10诊断代码的细粒度，在普通最小二乘法（OLS）中实现正则化，以平衡模型的准确性、可解释性和参数一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型在高维回归中难以同时保证准确性和参数一致性，尤其是使用细粒度ICD-10代码时。

Method: 通过截断ICD-10代码（如从7字符减少到6字符），降低回归问题的维度，同时保留所有诊断代码类别。

Result: 截断ICD-10代码减少了系数估计的方差，提高了模型的稳定性，同时保持了可解释性。

Conclusion: 降低ICD-10代码的细粒度是一种有效的正则化策略，解释了为何实际应用中更倾向于使用较宽泛的诊断分组（如DRGs和HCC代码）。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that
detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs
constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual

Result: OrbitAll在预测带电、开壳和溶剂化分子时表现优异，且能泛化到更大分子，训练数据需求减少10倍，速度比密度泛函理论快10^3-10^4倍。

Conclusion: OrbitAll通过物理驱动的架构实现了化学精度，为复杂分子系统的表示和预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

Method: 训练自编码器生成自适应滤波器权重，在潜在空间更新参数，并通过解码器生成滤波器。

Result: 在特定条件下，Latent FxLMS模型收敛更快，稳态误差与传统FxLMS相当。

Conclusion: 利用潜在空间优化自适应滤波器权重可提升FxLMS算法的性能。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

Motivation: 解决不规则几何域上复杂空间相关性和非线性时间动态联合建模的挑战。

Result: 在心脏时空动态预测中，TK-GCN表现优于现有基准模型，预测准确性高。

Conclusion: TK-GCN能有效建模复杂空间结构和非线性时间动态，适用于长程预测。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Result: 高阶PINN模型在挑战性ODE基准测试中表现出更高的精度，适用于控制不确定物理系统。

Conclusion: 高阶PINN模型能有效提升ODE求解精度，尤其在参数和初始条件变化的情况下。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Conclusion: 集成方法在多样物理系统中表现出鲁棒性，是传统求解器的高效准确替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs
models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and

depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant
behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和LLMs的方法为健康行为干预提供了更高效的数据利用方式。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Conclusion: 神经网络泛化能力可通过局部极值点动态映射解释，极值增量算法为优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both

models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional
representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine
learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

Conclusion: 该模型有望提升AD的早期诊断和患者治疗效果。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种领域中优于现有风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为风险敏感强化学习提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效解决了多模态数据不平衡和未对齐问题，提升了数据融合质量。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为mol-infer-GNN的新框架，结合图神经网络（GNN）和混合整数线性规划（MILP），用于推断具有特定结构和性质的化学化合物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过手工特征向量构建预测函数，但由于MILP的限制，学习性能不足。GNN能直接利用化学图作为输入，性能更优。

Method: 结合GNN和MILP的mol-infer-GNN框架，保留化学图结构的灵活性。

Result: 在QM9数据集上，GNN模型对某些性质表现出良好的学习性能，并能推断最多20个非氢原子的化学图。

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN框架在性能和灵活性上优于传统方法，适用于小分子推断。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

*Mohamed Hamad,Mohamed Mabrok,Nizar Zorba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba架构的多通道时空模型（MCST-Mamba），用于同时预测多个交通特征，解决了现有方法只能预测单一变量或需要多个模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测对智能交通系统至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉多变量间的联合模式。

Method: MCST-Mamba模型利用Mamba选择性状态空间架构，结合自适应时空嵌入，分别建模时间和空间关系。

Result: 模型在所有交通特征上表现优异，且参数更少。

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba为多变量交通预测提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: 基于注意力的架构在知识图谱补全任务中能有效捕捉复杂关系模式。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and
their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information
retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model
that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation
features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

Motivation: 实验室传感器异常检测需要快速适应新液体或传感器的能力，同时保持低延迟和小数据需求。

Method: 使用定制PCB捕获传感器数据，通过基于注意力的单类自动编码器进行训练，模型转换为TensorFlow-Lite二进制文件并在边缘设备上运行。

Result: 模型在仅30分钟正常数据训练后，F1分数为0.72，精度为0.89，召回率为0.61，推理延迟低于2秒。

Conclusion: 该管道快速适应新环境，适合边缘部署，满足实验室需求。

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置嵌入无法充分捕捉源代码的层次结构（如AST），因此需要一种新的方法。

Method: 提出树形位置嵌入，编码AST的层次关系（如节点深度和兄弟索引），并将其集成到CodeBERTa模型中。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa在MLM和克隆检测任务中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 显式结构信息对Transformer模型的源代码表示至关重要。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Conclusion: 研究为城市建模提供了网络效应整合方法，对政策制定有启示。

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential
for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature
directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops
and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge
layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data.
Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF)
were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model,
preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high
predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent

Motivation: SAM通过优化损失函数的几何形状提升泛化能力，但在噪声数据和隐私问题下，现有数据影响评估工具（如IF）无法直接适用。

Method: 提出了两种创新方法：基于Hessian的IF和基于梯度轨迹的IF，分别适用于不同场景。

Result: 实验证明这两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，可用于识别错误标签数据、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 本文方法为SAM中的数据影响评估提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Method: EMERALD采用空间潜在状态和MaskGIT预测，生成潜在空间中的准确轨迹。

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD实现了新的最先进性能，首次在10M环境步数内超越人类专家表现，并解锁所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD提供了一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFKD方法通常假设教师模型可信，但忽略了来自不可信教师（如NTL教师）的鲁棒性和安全性问题。本文首次探讨了DFKD在NTL教师下的表现。

Method: 提出ATEsc方法，通过分析合成样本的对抗鲁棒性，将其分为ID-like和OOD-like两组，分别用于知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD在NTL教师下的表现。

Conclusion: ATEsc为DFKD在不可信教师场景下提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.
Code is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GNNs与Transformers在编码策略上的差异，探索在无需相对位置信息的领域中（如单细胞转录组学）是否可用GNNs替代Transformers。

Method: 比较GNNs与Transformers的编码策略，设计合成示例验证其等价性，并在单细胞转录组学数据集上进行实验。

Result: GNNs在单细胞转录组学中表现与Transformers相当，但计算资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: 在无需相对位置信息的场景中，GNNs可作为Transformers的高效替代方案，挑战了Transformers始终最优的传统观念。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Tsetlin机器（TM）的概率评分方法，用于增强模型预测的可解释性和不确定性量化。通过模拟数据和CIFAR-10数据集的应用验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升Tsetlin机器（TM）模型的透明度和解释性，通过概率评分和不确定性量化技术进一步理解其预测行为。

Method: 分析TM学习动态，推导出概率评分；使用模拟数据验证评分与数据概率的关系；在CIFAR-10数据集上应用不确定性量化技术。

Result: 概率评分与数据概率显著相关；TM在训练数据域外预测信心较低，与神经网络的外推现象形成对比；CIFAR-10实验提供了改进TM图像分类模型的见解。

Conclusion: 提出的概率评分和不确定性量化技术增强了TM的可解释性，为模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

integration with deep learning frameworks. We present JAX-MPM, a
general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市空气污染对健康构成严重威胁，特别是氮氧化物超标问题，需开发高精度预测工具以支持决策。

Method: 结合10年监测站数据和30年气象记录，评估17种机器学习算法，最终选择Extra Trees模型。

Result: 模型预测准确率为77%，显著优于传统方法；气象条件（温度、风速、湿度）是污染主因，交通和季节变化形成周期性污染模式。

Conclusion: 智能预测系统为城市规划和环境管理提供有力工具，可改善空气质量并拯救生命。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology
exists today to transform urban air quality management. All research materials

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型的理论结构提供了新的见解，并验证了基本等式的正确性。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法直接优化敏感数据，可能强化其暴露，违背最小化使用原则。

Method: 利用生成模型自身生成导致分布崩溃的现象，部分触发崩溃以遗忘敏感数据。

Result: 理论证明PMC能收敛到遗忘目标，实验显示其更有效移除私有信息。

Conclusion: PMC为更全面的遗忘方法提供了重要进展，符合实际隐私约束。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Motivation: 环肽具有线性肽不具备的几何约束，但设计目标特异性环肽因数据有限而未被充分探索。

Method: CP-Composer将复杂环化模式分解为单位约束，通过几何条件引入扩散模型，训练时学习线性肽的单位约束及其随机组合。

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成多样化的目标结合环肽，成功率在38%至84%之间。

Conclusion: CP-Composer为环肽设计提供了有效工具，填补了数据不足的空白。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩恢复在压缩感知理论中具有重要意义，但现有方法主要针对矩阵数据。为了处理高维多路数据的低秩恢复问题，需要扩展现有算法到张量领域。

Method: 提出TNIHT方法，扩展了归一化迭代硬阈值（NIHT）算法，支持CP和Tucker两种张量分解模型，并在张量受限等距性（TRIP）条件下建立收敛理论。

Result: 通过合成数据、图像和视频数据的数值实验，验证了TNIHT方法的有效性，并与其他先进算法进行了性能对比。

Conclusion: TNIHT方法能够有效恢复高维低秩张量，理论分析和实验结果表明其优于现有算法，适用于多路数据恢复任务。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“power attention”的线性成本序列建模层，解决了传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中分别存在成本过高和过低的问题，滑动窗口注意力等方法又损害了上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入power attention层，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核以避免内存和带宽瓶颈。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种有效的长序列建模解决方案，兼具高效性和实用性。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Result: 在多个基准测试中有效减少过度拒绝，同时保持对有害查询的处理能力和模型整体实用性。

Conclusion: ACTOR是一种高效且鲁棒的训练框架，能显著减少过度拒绝问题。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

Result: 在模拟环境中成功减少简化道路车辆的空气阻力，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为有限传感器信息的现实环境提供了可行的控制策略优化方案。

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，且通信效率高。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm是一种高效且适合资源受限环境的联邦学习框架。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TinyProto通过类原型稀疏化和自适应缩放，显著降低联邦学习的通信开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中通信效率低的问题，特别是在资源受限环境下原型共享方法的局限性。

Method: 采用类原型稀疏化（CPS）和自适应原型缩放技术，减少传输数据量。

Result: 实验显示TinyProto通信成本降低4倍，性能不降。

Conclusion: TinyProto高效、无客户端计算负担，适用于异构联邦学习。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多CATE估计算法在不同组分配下对同一实例表现出不一致的学习行为，这一问题导致更高的测试误差且无法通过传统机器学习技术解决。

Method: 提出了CLAGA方法，旨在消除不一致性，适用于任何现有的CATE估计算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CLAGA显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: CLAGA是一种通用且有效的方法，解决了CATE估计中的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于交互式可视化的RLHF方法，通过分组比较提高人类反馈效率，显著提升了策略性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RLHF依赖成对比较，效率较低。本文旨在利用人类视觉能力，通过分组比较和探索提升反馈效率。

Result: 在六项模拟机器人任务中，最终策略回报提升了69.34%，错误率降低且策略更优。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RLHF的效率和效果，代码已开源，支持人机对齐研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Motivation: 现有特征重要性方法难以捕捉高阶交互和区分重叠贡献，需一种更全面的模型无关方法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据（如TCGA-BRCA基因表达数据）中准确恢复理论和预期结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于交互分析的特征选择或模型开发提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出三种农业特定的自监督学习任务（TD、FP、FF），在农作物分类和产量预测任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs）的自监督学习任务忽略了农业景观的独特时间特性（如自然周期）。

Method: 提出三种农业特定的自监督学习任务：时间差异预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF）。

Result: 在SICKLE数据集上，FF在作物分类任务中达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE；FF在印度全国尺度上表现优异。

Conclusion: 农业特定的自监督学习任务显著提升了遥感基础模型在农业应用中的性能。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统恶意软件检测方法因特征提取效率低而难以实时部署，需要解决准确性与效率的权衡问题。

Method: 将恶意软件分类建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用D3QN框架进行动态特征选择。

Result: 在Big2015和BODMAS数据集上，D3QN分别达到99.22%和98.83%的准确率，同时大幅减少特征数量（96.6%和97.6%降维）。

Conclusion: 强化学习的自适应特征选择方法在恶意软件分类中表现出色，实现了高精度和高效计算的平衡。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Result: 在树结构和特定随机图结构上取得显著改进，实验表明该方法在训练成本上优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 提出的因果HRL框架通过理论分析和实验验证，显著提升了任务效率和训练效果。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率电路（PCs）在表示学习方面尚未充分探索，现有方法依赖外部神经嵌入或基于激活的编码。

Method: APCs扩展了PCs，联合建模数据和嵌入，通过可处理的概率推理获取嵌入表示，并与神经解码器集成。

Result: APCs在重建质量、嵌入生成和处理缺失数据方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APCs是一种强大且灵活的表征学习方法，展示了在鲁棒推理、分布外检测和知识蒸馏中的潜力。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 研究逆强化学习（IRL）的动机是通过观察代理行为推断其潜在效用函数，从而理解其决策过程。

Method: 第一章利用显示偏好理论（Afriat定理）重构代理的效用函数；第二章研究贝叶斯IRL，分析理性疏忽的贝叶斯效用最大化代理；第三章提出基于Langevin动力学的自适应IRL方法。

Result: 研究结果表明，IRL方法能够有效识别代理的效用函数和行为模式，包括认知雷达和贝叶斯最优序列检测器的存在。

Conclusion: 该专著展示了IRL在多种场景下的应用潜力，尤其是通过自适应方法实时跟踪时变效用函数的能力。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Motivation: 研究目标是在不假设最优策略存在于给定策略类中的情况下，找到性能与最佳策略竞争的策略。

Method: 提出了一种通用策略学习框架，将其转化为非欧几里得空间的一阶优化问题，并分析了三种算法：Steepest Descent Policy Optimization、Conservative Policy Iteration和Policy Mirror Descent。

Result: 在策略类满足凸性和变分梯度主导（VGD）条件的假设下，获得了三种算法的样本复杂度上界。

Conclusion: 论文通过实验验证了VGD条件的实际相关性，为策略学习提供了新的理论支持和算法改进。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了应用分层多标签分类问题，并在实际部署中验证了其价值。

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Result: 新框架将攻击成功率提升48%，效率提高两个数量级，并发现大多数优化策略对输出危害性影响有限。

Conclusion: 尾部感知的攻击和评估方法对准确评估和增强语言模型安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

Conclusion: 迁移学习的效果依赖于特征核的适应性和权重耦合机制，任务对齐和数据规模是关键因素。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF方法在LLM对齐中存在高计算成本、内存需求和训练不稳定性，尤其是在大模型上。

Method: 提出ESSA框架，结合进化策略和低秩适应，减少优化维度，无需梯度计算。

Result: ESSA在数学推理任务中比梯度方法（如GRPO）收敛更快且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: ESSA为LLM对齐提供了一种高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within

function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

*Xujia Wang. Yunjia Qi,Bin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoSiA是一种动态优化关键参数的PEFT方法，通过梯度稀疏分析定位子网络，减少矩阵乘法，提升计算效率。LoSiA-Pro进一步降低训练延迟27%，性能接近全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）在领域专业化任务中计算效率低且性能不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出LoSiA，通过梯度稀疏分析动态定位并优化子网络参数，减少矩阵乘法；LoSiA-Pro是其高效实现版本。

Result: LoSiA在领域专业化和常识推理任务中性能接近全微调，训练时间最短，且减少遗忘。

Conclusion: LoSiA在计算效率和性能上优于现有PEFT方法，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的上下文异常检测（CAD）框架——正常性评分（NS），通过显式建模随机和认知不确定性，提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多异常检测任务中，存在影响目标变量正常性的上下文变量，但这些变量本身并不指示异常。现有方法未能充分建模不确定性，限制了检测的可靠性。

Method: 基于异方差高斯过程回归，将Z分数视为随机变量，提供反映异常评估可靠性的置信区间。

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学实际应用中，NS在检测准确性和可解释性上优于现有CAD方法。

Conclusion: NS框架通过不确定性驱动的决策过程，特别适用于医疗等领域，展示了其在异常检测中的优越性。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

TL;DR: DOTResize是一种基于离散最优传输理论的Transformer模型压缩方法，通过合并相似神经元减少模型宽度，优于现有剪枝技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练模型（如LLMs）存在计算冗余，模型压缩可降低成本同时保持性能。

Method: 将神经元宽度减少问题建模为离散最优传输问题，结合熵正则化和矩阵分解优化传输映射。

Result: DOTResize在多个LLM家族和规模上优于现有剪枝技术，显著降低实际计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize通过保留和重新分配有用信号，提供了一种高效的模型压缩方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Conclusion: 该模型在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高效且准确的AMC，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification
accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and
RML2018.01a datasets, respectively demonstrating a strong balance between model

Conclusion: 该方法具有实时适应性和可解释性，适合无线数字孪生平台和6G网络规划。

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Result: 在多种模型（如Llama 2、Llama 3等）上表现优于其他4位量化方法，且在更低位数（如any3和any2）下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: any4是一种高效、无需预处理的4位量化方法，适用于大型语言模型，并开源了相关代码。

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large

compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息论的扩散模型采样方法（IGDS），用于提升数据集蒸馏在低IPC（每类图像数）下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在数据集蒸馏任务中表现良好，但在低IPC设置下生成的样本多样性不足。

Method: 通过最大化原型信息I(X;Y)和上下文信息H(X|Y)的加权和，提出信息引导的扩散采样（IGDS），并使用变分估计逼近这些信息量。

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上的实验表明，IGDS在所有IPC设置下均优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC下表现显著。

Conclusion: IGDS通过信息论视角优化扩散模型采样，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能和多样性。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MLLM-SC框架通过语义引导和自适应资源分配，显著提升了6G网络中任务导向通信的性能。

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

Method: 通过物理启发的自组织稀疏自编码器（SOSAE），结构化稀疏化特征空间，动态截断非活跃部分。

Result: SOSAE在多种数据集上表现优异，计算量减少130倍，性能不变。

Conclusion: SOSAE提供了一种高效且性能优越的自编码器特征空间调整方法。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

Conclusion: 该框架支持无监督学习，显著减少对人工干预的依赖，在非单射回归任务中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate surface roughness prediction in ultra-precision machining (UPM) is

excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and
deep learning models (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) demonstrate that augmenting

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，DANCE在准确性和搜索成本上优于现有NAS方法，并能适应不同硬件需求。

Conclusion: DANCE通过动态架构演化，显著提升了NAS的实用性和性能一致性。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

Conclusion: SEED方法通过自进化蒸馏和模式寻求进化，有效解决了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Method: 提出SWR方法，通过逐步缩放权重防止无界增长，同时保留学习信息。

Result: 理论证明SWR能限制权重幅度并平衡层间权重，实验显示其在多种学习任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: SWR有效解决权重无界增长问题，提升网络可塑性和性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合了KAN的非线性表达能力与MLP的效率，通过FiLM机制和RBF激活函数改进KAN的计算成本和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)在计算成本和分类任务性能上的局限性。

Method: 提出MJKAN，结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构。

Result: 在函数回归任务中表现优于MLP，但在图像和文本分类中需调整基函数数量以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KAN的理论优势，同时提升了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

TL;DR: CB-RM是一个通过选择性概念标注实现可解释偏好学习的奖励建模框架，优于传统RLHF方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法依赖不透明的奖励函数，缺乏可解释性，CB-RM旨在通过分解奖励预测为可解释概念来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于动态获取最有信息量概念标签的主动学习策略，采用Expected Information Gain作为获取函数。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，CB-RM在可解释性和样本效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CB-RM为更透明、可审计且与人类对齐的奖励模型迈出了一步。

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

Conclusion: 通用LLM在BLAS代码生成中表现出色，尤其在优化方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Conclusion: 为未来城市环境中通用LLM智能体的实现迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

Abstract: This work shows that normalization layers can facilitate a surprising degree

normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing

results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 利用原型对抗学习统一特征空间，通过协作学习强化类别信息，并混合全局原型与局部特征增强分类器。

Result: 在三个特征漂移数据集上，FedPall表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FedPall有效解决了特征漂移问题，提升了联邦学习中的分类性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

Motivation: 大规模标注数据获取和训练成本高，小数据集易导致模型结果不稳定、过拟合和虚假相关性学习。标签缺乏解释性，模型可能学习任意分类规则。

Method: 采用两阶段训练循环，交替提升模型预测准确性和注意力匹配解释信号，使模型学习标签分配背后的逻辑。

Result: 该方法加速了模型收敛，提升了在小规模、类别不平衡或含虚假特征数据上的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过结合解释信号，该方法在小数据集上训练出更可靠和准确的分类模型。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Result: 在公开数据集上，NTSFormer在多模态冷启动节点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: NTSFormer通过自学习和统一框架有效解决了冷启动节点的孤立性和模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

Motivation: DRL系统在安全关键应用中日益普及，但其安全性研究不足，尤其是后门攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出了两种攻击方法：TrojanentRL（利用组件级漏洞植入持久后门）和InfrectroRL（无需训练数据的后训练攻击）。

Result: 在六种Atari环境中，攻击效果与现有训练时后门攻击相当，且能规避两种主流防御。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了DRL供应链的脆弱性，呼吁加强防御措施。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Result: 在真实地理空间数据集上测试，ConBatch-BAL策略优于随机基准，甚至超越无约束方案。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略能有效降低实际场景中的主动学习成本和迭代次数。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多个小规模领域特定数据集的训练策略，替代传统的大规模非结构化数据集，以提高上下文学习模型的泛化能力，同时解决存储、质量评估和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式依赖大规模非结构化数据集，存在存储成本高、质量评估难、隐私和伦理问题。

Method: 利用多个小规模领域特定数据集，结合元学习在Meta-Album集合上训练上下文学习模型，测试其在未见领域、持续学习和无监督场景中的表现。

Result: 模型在未见领域和持续学习场景中表现良好，泛化能力提升，且性能与单一大规模数据集训练的模型相当。

Conclusion: 通过精心策划的数据集集合训练，Transformer模型在上下文预测中仍能泛化，同时具有模块化和可替换性的优势。

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Motivation: 理解神经网络性能扩展的机制，并解决无限宽度极限对有限宽度模型的影响问题。

Method: 通过神经切线核（NTK）分析数据和模型扩展下的神经网络行为，量化特征学习与核驱动扩展的过渡。

Result: 发现性能扩展指数相似但内部动态相反，确定了支持特征学习的最大模型宽度。

Conclusion: 性能扩展不足以理解神经网络机制，需结合内部动态分析；特征学习在有限宽度模型中存在上限。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

Motivation: 高维数据回归问题中，正则化超参数的调整对避免过拟合和实现有效变量选择至关重要。本文旨在改进现有泛化误差界，使其适应数据分布的“友好性”。

Method: 通过假设任务内数据为i.i.d.抽样（如子高斯分布），推导出泛化误差界，并推广到岭回归的变体。

Result: 在数据分布较“友好”时，泛化误差界不随特征维度d增加而恶化，且优于现有统一界。

Conclusion: 本文提出的分布依赖泛化误差界在高维数据下表现更优，为多任务线性回归中的正则化参数调整提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶测试提供了可扩展的场景选择基础，提升了测试效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注孤立成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物有意义PPI网络的能力，这对生物学研究至关重要。

Method: PRING构建了一个高质量、多物种PPI网络数据集，并设计了两种互补评估范式：拓扑导向任务和功能导向任务。

Result: 实验表明当前PPI模型在恢复PPI网络的结构和功能特性上存在潜在局限性。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DICE方法是一种生成建模方法，通过学习有限时间点上的样本群体演化来捕捉平滑的群体动态，而非复杂的个体轨迹动态。其损失函数具有不变性，提高了训练稳定性和鲁棒性，且生成样本速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉群体动态的平滑性，且个体轨迹可能表现出复杂或混沌行为。DICE旨在解决这些问题，提供更稳定和高效的建模方法。

Method: DICE通过学习有限时间点的样本群体演化，设计了一种不变性损失函数，避免训练中的虚假常数干扰，并直接在时间区间内生成样本。

Result: DICE在训练稳定性和样本生成效率上优于其他方法，适用于随机波、Vlasov-Poisson不稳定性等高维混沌问题。

Conclusion: DICE是一种高效、稳定的生成建模方法，适用于捕捉群体动态，并在复杂问题中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

Result: 提供了一种易于理解和实现的KFAC教程，帮助初学者深入理解并降低实践难度。

Conclusion: 本文为KFAC提供了现代视角，旨在促进其更广泛的应用和扩展。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

Motivation: 解决神经符号AI在资源受限的TinyML硬件上部署时，符号模型的计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 1. 训练硬件高效的确定性PCs；2. 使用n次方根压缩技术压缩PCs；3. 在TinyML硬件上部署完整NSAI模型。

Result: 相比64位精度基线，FPGA资源占用显著减少（FF减少82.3%，LUTs减少52.6%，Flash减少18.0%），ESP32微控制器推理速度平均提升4.67倍。

Conclusion: 通过硬件/软件协同设计，实现了NSAI在TinyML硬件上的高效部署，为嵌入式场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field
models, where the target random variable comprises both continuous and
categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

Motivation: 现有基准测试的模型排名矛盾，导致模型选择和比较困难，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用“训练-测试”方法，对61个模型在24个基准上进行统一微调后评估。

Result: “训练-测试”显著提升了排名一致性，增强了排名的外部有效性，并揭示了基准性能的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 建议将“训练-测试”作为语言模型基准测试的默认组成部分。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Result: 揭示了孤立预测任务的局限性，为干预导向的ADS开发和部署奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 需转变范式，将ADS视为决策支持和干预工具，以更全面地评估其社会影响。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

Result: 实验证明QuEst在经济建模、民意调查和语言模型自评估中具有实用性。

Conclusion: QuEst为基于分位数的分布度量提供了灵活且严谨的推断工具。

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

Motivation: 随着LLM参数规模增加，计算资源需求限制了其使用范围，第三方推理服务虽流行但存在隐私风险。现有安全方案如SMPC因高开销难以扩展。

Method: Cascade协议利用序列维度分片技术，牺牲部分密码学隐私保证以换取性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Cascade为现代LLM的安全部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在生成主题摘要时难以保持主题聚焦的问题，尤其是对小模型而言。

Method: 采用三种logits重加权技术：常量偏移、因子缩放和阈值选择，以提升主题相关词汇的使用。

Result: 在NEWTS数据集上的实验表明，阈值选择方法能有效提高主题聚焦且不降低摘要质量。

Conclusion: 直接重加权logits是一种实用且资源高效的替代微调方法，可精确控制生成文本的主题内容。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习在GWAS中的应用，提出了一种避免数据泄漏的多标签框架，提升了多疾病分析的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GWAS方法难以捕捉非线性遗传互作，而现有深度学习方法存在数据泄漏或局限于已知通路的问题。

Method: 研究了不同深度学习架构，并扩展为多标签框架，联合建模五种疾病，利用共享遗传结构。

Result: 在37,000样本和五百万SNPs上，AUC达到0.68-0.96，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为多疾病GWAS提供了可扩展、无泄漏且具生物学意义的分析工具。

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.
