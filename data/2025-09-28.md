*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）下一个令牌概率（NTPs）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来高效识别VLM生成的文本与视觉内容不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本不匹配）降低了模型的可靠性，而现有的检测方法通常需要额外的VLM进行评估，计算成本高且增加延迟。

Method: 利用VLM的下一个令牌概率（NTPs）作为模型不确定性的量化指标，训练传统ML模型进行幻觉检测。还探索了结合语言NTPs和VLM幻觉预测分数的方法。

Result: NTPs特征是有效的幻觉预测因子，使简单的ML模型能达到与强大VLM相当的检测性能。结合语言NTPs和VLM预测分数能进一步提升检测效果。

Conclusion: 基于NTPs的轻量级方法为增强VLM可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案，有望在实际应用中替代计算密集的VLM评估方法。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于独立书写者离线手写签名验证，通过SPD空间中的黎曼高斯混合模型生成合成数据，在真实数据集上取得了低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决独立书写者设置下离线手写签名验证的挑战，特别是当模型需要泛化到未见过的个体时，传统方法依赖真实签名数据集进行训练。

Method: 利用对称正定矩阵(SPD)的黎曼几何，通过少量真实样本在SPD空间中建立黎曼高斯混合模型，识别黎曼中心作为合成书写者，方差作为其属性，然后进行黎曼高斯采样生成正负合成SPD群体。

Result: 在两个包含西方和亚洲书写风格的流行签名数据集上的实验表明，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下都取得了低错误率。

Conclusion: 准合成方法在黎曼空间中生成合成数据对于独立书写者签名验证系统具有潜力，能够有效降低错误率。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

### [3] [Seedream 4.0: Toward Next-generation Multimodal Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20427)
*Team Seedream,Yunpeng Chen,Yu Gao,Lixue Gong,Meng Guo,Qiushan Guo,Zhiyao Guo,Xiaoxia Hou,Weilin Huang,Yixuan Huang,Xiaowen Jian,Huafeng Kuang,Zhichao Lai,Fanshi Li,Liang Li,Xiaochen Lian,Chao Liao,Liyang Liu,Wei Liu,Yanzuo Lu,Zhengxiong Luo,Tongtong Ou,Guang Shi,Yichun Shi,Shiqi Sun,Yu Tian,Zhi Tian,Peng Wang,Rui Wang,Xun Wang,Ye Wang,Guofeng Wu,Jie Wu,Wenxu Wu,Yonghui Wu,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Shuang Xu,Xin Yan,Ceyuan Yang,Jianchao Yang,Zhonghua Zhai,Chenlin Zhang,Heng Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xinyu Zhang,Yuwei Zhang,Shijia Zhao,Wenliang Zhao,Wenjia Zhu*

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，统一了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，采用高效的扩散变换器和优化的VAE，能够快速生成1K-4K高分辨率图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个统一的框架来处理文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合任务，通过高效架构和优化策略实现快速高质量图像生成。

Method: 使用高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE减少图像token数量，通过多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务，集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码进行推理加速。

Result: 在2K图像生成上推理时间达到1.8秒，在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，展示了在复杂任务中的卓越多模态能力。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更交互式和多维度的创意工具，为创意和专业应用推进了生成AI的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的半监督框架，用于乳腺癌检测，在有限标注数据下实现96.7%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测至关重要。深度学习虽然效果好但需要大量标注数据，而医学影像标注数据稀缺，因此需要开发能在小标注数据集上有效的方法

Method: 使用Resnet-50在半监督对比学习框架下训练，利用大量未标注乳腺X光片数据，通过相似性指数和各种数据增强技术提升性能，最后在小标注数据集上微调

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 对比学习框架在医学影像分析中具有显著优势，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下，能够有效提升乳腺癌检测的准确性

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基础模型在工业质量检测中表现不佳，尽管在公开数据集上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型的零样本泛化能力替代繁琐的人工标注，实现跨产品的自动化质量检测。

Method: 在定制工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型。

Result: 所有模型在真实工业数据上都失败，但在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测场景中的实际应用仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS）框架，通过编码器-解码器架构预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块共享同一特征空间，减少冗余并提高跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI模型针对特定高精度任务定制导致的低效问题，特别是在包含一系列模块化任务的应用中，每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，编码器学习变换感知、可泛化的表示，多个下游模块共享同一特征空间。

Result: 证明了去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等成像和视觉模块可以在NS中高效执行，减少了冗余并改善了跨域泛化。

Conclusion: NS架构为高效的多任务视觉流水线奠定了基础，相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量，具有更广泛的硬件适用性。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在边缘设备上选择最有用的训练图像，以在保持低传输成本的同时最大化模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘相机系统不断扩展，面临不断变化的环境，需要定期更新模型。实践中，复杂教师模型在中央服务器上运行以标注数据，然后用于训练适应有限计算能力的边缘设备的小型模型。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，选择最有用的图像进行训练。

Result: 在相似的训练负载下，该方法能够以最少的数据库查询产生高质量的模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是在边缘设备训练中平衡模型质量和传输成本的有效方法。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂的样式控制，支持单件或多件服装的试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法需要精确绘制二进制掩码来控制生成布局，这既困难又需要专业知识，且在某些情况下无法实现复杂的样式控制（如卷起袖子等）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本样式指令，无需手动绘制精确掩码。

Result: InstructVTON简化了最终用户体验，移除了精确绘制掩码的必要性，并自动执行多轮图像生成，实现传统掩码方法无法完成的试穿场景。

Conclusion: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，能够实现最先进的结果并提供样式控制功能。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上对三个难度级别分别达到96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率，但阈值选择对性能影响很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边境控制、法医和财政准入等应用中，对手可能故意修改指纹脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要能够稳健识别被篡改指纹的系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集的三个难度级别上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，对Easy、Medium、Hard三个难度级别分别达到96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率；但当阈值从0.92放松到0.72时，准确率急剧下降到7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明已准备好用于现实世界部署，其中安全性和识别弹性都至关重要。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: 探索如何利用预训练视觉模型的注意力机制来增强机器人操作的语义理解能力，特别是在双手操作任务中。

Method: 从DINOv2自监督ViT模型中提取注意力图，将其解释为像素级显著性分数，然后提升到3D体素网格中，形成体素级语义线索，并整合到行为克隆策略中。

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试的所有任务中，注意力引导的特征化方法带来了平均8.2%的绝对改进和21.9%的相对增益。

Conclusion: 将预训练视觉变换器的注意力图集成到体素表示中能有效提升双手机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究对36种实时目标检测模型（YOLOv8-v12和RT-DETRv1-v2）在蓝莓检测任务上进行了基准测试，使用包含85,879个标注实例的新数据集，并通过半监督学习进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然环境中蓝莓检测面临光照变化、遮挡和运动模糊等挑战，需要大规模多样化数据集和合适的精度/速度/内存权衡模型。

Method: 使用新构建的661张蓝莓冠层图像数据集评估36种模型变体，并采用无偏均值教师半监督学习在1,035张未标记图像上进行微调。

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50，半监督学习后RT-DETRv2-X提升至94.8% mAP@50。

Conclusion: 中等规模模型在精度和速度间提供良好平衡，半监督学习能提升检测性能，但需要更深入研究以充分利用跨域未标记数据。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

TL;DR: 在Mini-DDSM乳腺X光数据集上，提出了一种轻量级ROI增强策略，通过概率性替换全图像为随机ROI裁剪来提升深度学习模型的性能，无需额外标签或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量，性能有待提升。

Method: 引入轻量级ROI增强策略：训练时概率性地用预计算的、无标签边界框库中的随机ROI裁剪替换全图像，可选抖动增加变异性，保持推理成本不变。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强（最佳参数：p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10）带来适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但性能在不同折叠间有变化；PR-AUC持平或略降。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在受限环境中增强乳腺X光分类性能，无需额外标签或架构修改。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: 利用镜面反射作为辅助视图，构建虚拟相机进行单图像多视角立体视觉，实现通用且鲁棒的3D重建，支持动态场景处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜面反射在日常环境中常见，能提供单次拍摄中的立体信息，简化成像过程并与前馈重建模型兼容。

Method: 将反射视为辅助视图，设计变换构建物理有效的虚拟相机，直接生成虚拟视图像素，并提出对称感知损失优化姿态估计。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性，提供了包含地面真实点云和相机姿态的合成数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法利用镜面反射实现了单图像多视角立体视觉，简化了成像过程，支持通用且鲁棒的3D重建，并扩展到动态场景。

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [15] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现人类在感知简单动画中的社会互动时，不仅依赖视觉特征，还使用语义表征来补充理解，其中基于动词的语义嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类在识别移动形状展示的社会互动时，除了视觉特征外还使用哪些语义表征来补充理解。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记动画印象；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社会互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息，其中从描述中提取的基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，在视觉和抽象表征之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Motivation: 现有方法在无人机不同方向和视野导致的严重外观变化下缺乏鲁棒性，阻碍跨域泛化；同时难以建立同时包含全局场景语义和细粒度局部细节的可靠对应关系。

Method: 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征；构建带虚拟超级节点的图结构，连接所有局部节点，实现全局语义聚合和局部区域再分配，强制全局-局部一致性。

Conclusion: EGS框架通过E(2)-Steerable CNN和全局-局部一致性图结构，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的鲁棒性和对应关系建立问题，在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Motivation: 红外小目标缺乏明显纹理和形态特征，容易与杂乱背景融合。现有方法依赖固定梯度算子或简单注意力机制，在低对比度和高噪声下难以准确提取目标边缘。

Method: 采用双路径架构：第一条路径使用双向交互模块（局部和全局自注意力）捕获多尺度特征依赖；第二条路径使用多边缘精炼器，通过级联泰勒有限差分算子和注意力门控机制增强边缘细节。

Result: 该方法能够精确检测和定位红外小目标，有效抑制噪声，为不同尺寸目标提供精确的边缘定位和特征增强。

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络结合结构语义和边缘精炼，为精确红外小目标检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Motivation: 传统的意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽略了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。为了解决这一局限，需要研究群体意图和预测其出现时机。

Conclusion: 该研究为群体意图预测领域建立了重要基础，提出的数据集和方法为未来研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Neptune-X是一个数据中心的生成-选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务感知样本选择来解决海事目标检测中数据稀缺和泛化能力差的问题。

Motivation: 海事目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺，以及在各种海事属性（如目标类别、视角、位置和成像环境）上的泛化能力差。现有数据集训练的模型在代表性不足的场景（如公海环境）中表现不佳。

Method: 提出Neptune-X框架，包含两个核心组件：1) X-to-Maritime多模态条件生成模型，通过双向对象-水域注意力模块捕捉对象与水域环境的边界交互；2) 属性相关主动采样，基于任务相关性动态选择合成样本。

Conclusion: Neptune-X通过生成多样化的合成数据和智能样本选择，有效解决了海事目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为海事视觉任务提供了强大的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有陨石坑导航主要针对短期降落任务，而月球测绘任务涉及稀疏、倾斜图像和变化光照条件，需要解决长期导航的挑战。

Method: 结合Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒透视n-陨石坑位姿求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: 在CRESENT+和CRESENT-365数据集上，STELLA在广泛视角、光照条件和月球纬度范围内平均保持米级位置精度和亚度姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境中对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务提供了操作条件参考。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

TL;DR: 研究发现单模态视觉和语言模型在表示空间中存在部分对齐，这种对齐在模型中层到深层达到峰值，反映从模态特定到概念共享表示的转变。对齐对语义变化敏感，能捕捉人类偏好，且通过样本聚合得到增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型在不同模态上训练，但它们将输入投影到部分对齐的表示空间。需要明确这种对齐在网络的何处出现、由什么线索支持、是否捕捉人类偏好，以及样本聚合如何影响对齐。

Method: 系统研究对齐在网络层中的出现位置、对视觉和语言变化的鲁棒性、在多对多图像-文本场景中的人类偏好匹配，以及样本聚合对对齐的影响。使用强制选择任务评估人类偏好与模型嵌入空间的对应关系。

Result: 对齐在两种模型的中层到深层达到峰值；对仅外观变化鲁棒但对语义变化敏感；人类偏好与所有视觉-语言模型对的嵌入空间匹配；样本聚合增强而非模糊对齐。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于共享语义代码，与人类判断对齐，并通过样本聚合得到加强，表明跨模态语义对齐是深度表示学习的涌现特性。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化对象插入任务中存在几何控制不足、风格不一致等限制，且需要大量训练。

Method: 将2D对象转换为3D，在3D空间进行交互编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，结合扩散适配器实现几何、风格和内容控制。

Result: 能够生成几何控制精确、风格一致的编辑图像，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过3D几何信息有效解决了对象插入中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，提供了一种无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer统一了生成和重建过程，实现了对个性化模型生成过程的全面训练自由控制，无需为每个模型重新训练控制器。

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Conclusion: DAC框架能有效解决CD-SSDG问题，在存在域偏移的情况下提升医学图像分割的泛化性能

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

TL;DR: DEIMv2是DEIM框架的升级版本，通过集成DINOv3特征和引入空间调谐适配器(STA)，在八个不同规模模型上实现了优越的性能-成本平衡，在目标检测任务中建立了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEIM已成为实时DETR的主流训练框架，显著优于YOLO系列。本研究旨在通过集成DINOv3特征来进一步提升其性能。

Method: 对于X、L、M、S变体，采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，并引入空间调谐适配器(STA)将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；对于超轻量模型，使用HGNetv2进行深度和宽度剪枝，结合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O。

Result: DEIMv2-X仅用5030万参数达到57.8 AP，超越之前需要6000万参数才能达到56.5 AP的X规模模型；DEIMv2-S是首个参数量低于1000万(971万)但超过50 AP的模型，达到50.9 AP；DEIMv2-Pico仅用150万参数实现38.5 AP，与230万参数的YOLOv10-Nano相当但参数量减少约50%。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的架构设计，在不同规模模型上都实现了优越的性能-成本平衡，为目标检测任务建立了新的最先进基准。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DAC-LoRA框架，将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调中，通过动态对抗课程提升视觉语言模型的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在关键应用中易受对抗攻击，CLIP作为基础模型的安全漏洞会级联影响整个多模态AI生态系统

Method: 基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES损失，设计动态对抗课程，逐步增加攻击难度，可应用于任何迭代攻击方法

Result: 在保持清洁准确率的同时显著提升对抗鲁棒性

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA是轻量级、广泛适用的方法，可轻松集成到标准PEFT流程中显著增强鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 提出FedDSPG方法，通过生成式视角为联邦域泛化任务生成域特定软提示，在未知域上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的联邦域泛化方法学习的提示多样性有限，且忽略未知域信息，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 为每个域引入域特定软提示，将内容和域知识整合到客户端生成模型中，在推理阶段生成未知域的提示。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在联邦域泛化任务中优于现有强基线，达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: FedDSPG方法从生成式视角有效解决了联邦域泛化问题，通过域特定软提示生成显著提升了模型在未知域的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VideoLLMs在视频理解方面表现出色，但先前采样策略的漏洞已被发现，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索。

Method: 使用闭环优化策略迭代优化通用扰动，通过基于影子VideoLLM和轻量级语言模型构建的描绘集来抑制有害帧相关性分数。

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上的综合评估显示，攻击成功率达到82%-99%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了提示引导采样策略的脆弱性，强调了为VideoLLMs开发更先进采样策略的重要性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过仅使用两个可训练参数动态平衡任务特定和知识蒸馏损失，解决了量化感知训练中梯度异质性问题，显著提升了小型量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定和蒸馏损失，主要由于异质梯度幅度导致监督信号冲突。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，使用两个可训练参数自适应平衡TS和KD目标；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，利用多个异构教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和大型语言模型压缩任务上，GoR持续优于最先进的QAT-KD方法；在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率；EKD-GoR在最优条件下可超越全精度模型。

Conclusion: GoR为实际部署提供了鲁棒解决方案，通过动态损失加权减少监督信号冲突，改善收敛性并提升小型量化模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 研究为大规模植物识别系统的发展提供了重要参考，特别是在如何利用网络上的大量但含噪声数据方面。挑战赛结果有助于理解数据质量和数量在深度学习模型中的权衡关系。

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: TasselNetV4是一个用于跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，结合了TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种的植物计数任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统植物计数方法需要为每种植物构建特定模型，但植物具有生物多样性且新品种不断涌现，无法穷尽所有物种。需要从'计数什么植物'转向'如何计数植物'的问题重构，特别是植物具有动态变化和非刚性结构的特点，使得现有类无关计数模型表现不佳。

Method: 基于普通视觉变换器构建，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，引入新颖的多分支框感知局部计数器来增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，TasselNetV4不仅实现了优越的计数性能，而且具有高效率，超越了最先进的类无关计数模型。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，为农业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Motivation: 现有的半监督学习方法在视网膜分割中经常产生解剖学上不合理的分割结果，无法有效建模层与病变之间的相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性的保证。

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，实现层和病变的双向影响联合学习，利用未标记和部分标记数据集，学习解耦的空间和风格因子表示。

Result: 在公共和内部OCT扫描数据集上的评估表明，该模型在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并能将层分割泛化到病理病例。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在半监督学习中使用解剖约束进行准确、鲁棒且可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法使用大型语言模型作为知识引擎，但图像描述常包含与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了其推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型将图像转换为描述，生成上下文示例，同时对描述进行总结和重排序以排除无关信息。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率，基于6.7B参数的LLM。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过描述重排序过程使LLMs更好地理解图像信息和问题，无需昂贵的端到端训练即可增强模型的推理能力和任务适应性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与评估之间的不对称性：在图像质量评估中表现优异的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，这种错位在对抗训练下更为明显。判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化目标（保真度和对抗性目标）作为优化目标的有效性与作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 进行系统性分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化和图像质量评估中的表现，研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在优化和评估之间存在不对称性；判别器能有效抑制优化过程中的伪影，但其学习表示作为IQA模型初始化时效果有限；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏见对推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 视频序列常包含结构化噪声和背景伪影，传统RPCA方法中的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核范数正则化和扩散模型先验进行视频分解。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强(gCNR)和信号保持(KS统计量)方面表现出更好的去雾性能。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验的方法在高保真视频恢复方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于transformer架构的概念瓶颈框架，专门为视频分类设计，能够处理任意长度的视频序列，通过全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性三个维度来解释视频中的动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，无法有效处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，这对于捕捉动作和事件至关重要。

Method: 受transformer启发，MoTIF将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频分类，将概念定义为跨时间重复出现的语义实体（如物体、属性、动作组件），形成描述动作的motif模式。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于概念建模的范式可以有效地迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的性能的同时，更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频领域，提供了多角度的可解释性分析，为视频分类的透明性和理解性做出了贡献。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远距离物体或计算资源受限的任务中，密集深度估计和3D场景重建不可行，需要一种轻量级的3D定位方法。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器处理单目标和多目标场景，基于相机姿态估计和图像分割结果进行3D定位。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器方法独立于检测方法，具有灵活性，可用于无人机野火监测等实际应用。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SwinMamba框架，结合局部Mamba扫描和全局感受野，用于遥感图像语义分割，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像分割中具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但依赖全局扫描会忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），这在遥感图像分割中至关重要。

Method: 受Swin Transformer启发，SwinMamba在移位窗口内集成局部Mamba式扫描与全局感受野。前两个阶段执行局部扫描捕获细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合上下文信息，使用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的广泛实验表明，SwinMamba优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba在遥感图像语义分割中表现出有效性和潜力，是优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于打包的多实例学习框架，通过将可变长度的特征序列打包成固定长度来支持批量训练，同时引入残差分支和注意力驱动的下采样器来减少特征损失和冗余，显著提升了计算病理学的训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（高达20万）、显著的序列长度变化（从200到20万）以及有限的监督信息，这些极端变化导致数据高度异质和冗余，传统方法在有限监督下难以有效处理这种异质性。

Method: 提出打包式MIL框架：1）将采样的可变长度特征序列打包成固定长度序列以支持批量训练；2）引入残差分支，将多个切片丢弃的特征组合成超切片进行训练；3）使用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上，该方法实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。广泛的实验表明，解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力。

Conclusion: 通过解决计算病理学中的数据异质性、冗余和有限监督等核心挑战，所提出的打包式MIL框架在显著提高训练效率的同时，大幅提升了模型性能，证明了在基础模型时代关注数据挑战的重要性。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: SimDiff是一个模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需在推理时重复调用模拟器即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层融入扩散过程以确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序性质，这些方法计算成本高昂且无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过将环境参数（如重力、风力）直接条件化到去噪过程中。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，无需推理时重复模拟器调用，并提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制，还能成功泛化到未见过的环境参数组合。

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将模拟器约束集成到扩散模型中，实现了高效、可控且具有组合泛化能力的物理合理人体运动生成。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过分析1174个预训练视觉模型，识别出四种能显著提升模型对高斯噪声鲁棒性的设计模式：更大的stem核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化以及监督ViT而非CLIP ViT。理论分析解释了这些发现，揭示了低通滤波、下采样、池化操作和预处理对噪声敏感性的影响机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉模型的鲁棒性通常被测量，但其对特定架构设计选择的依赖性很少被剖析。本文旨在研究为什么某些视觉架构天生对加性高斯噪声更鲁棒，并将这些经验发现转化为简单可行的设计规则。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别出四种一致的鲁棒性设计模式。开发理论分析来解释这些发现，包括证明低通stem核的噪声衰减特性、下采样的噪声能量减少、平均池化与最大池化的对比分析，以及CLIP ViT脆弱性的像素空间Lipschitz边界分析。

Result: 识别出的设计模式可带来高达506位的排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益。理论分析表明：低通stem核的噪声衰减增益随核大小二次方减小；反混叠下采样按采样因子平方减少噪声能量；平均池化无偏且按池化窗口面积抑制噪声；CLIP预处理使最坏情况敏感性比监督ViT高1.91倍。

Conclusion: 研究结果将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了解释观察趋势的理论，并建立了实用的即插即用指南，用于设计对高斯噪声更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to

Motivation: 现有方法需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为先决条件，限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和开箱即用应用。

Conclusion: ASD成功实现了SSL学习器的冷启动图像聚类，无需任何先决条件，在多个数据集上表现出色，并能增强现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

Motivation: Vision Transformers会产生高范数伪影，在知识蒸馏时这些伪影会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过拟合伪影而忽略信息信号，限制了从大模型中获得的收益。

Result: 在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能，生成了更清晰和可解释的表征。

Conclusion: SiNGER框架能有效解决教师模型中伪影问题，提升知识蒸馏效果，为学生模型带来显著性能提升。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth

Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables

handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets

Conclusion: SNCE方法通过单神经元操作实现了精确的概念擦除，在安全性和图像质量之间取得了良好平衡，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出KD-SS算法，用于生物点云的下采样，无需降低输入数据分辨率，实现全分辨率点云分割，适用于不同植物物种和传感器模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物器官点云分割方法针对特定植物物种或传感器模态设计，且通常需要大量预处理和下采样以满足硬件或神经网络输入要求。

Method: 提出KD-SS算法，这是一种简单有效的生物点云下采样方法，对传感器数据和植物物种具有通用性。

Result: 将KD-SS与当前最先进的分割模型结合，在摄影测量、激光三角测量和LiDAR等不同模态下，对各种植物物种都取得了令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: KD-SS作为轻量级分辨率保持方法，可替代密集预处理和下采样方法，适用于任何植物物种和传感器模态的植物器官分割。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo是一个用于少样本分布外检测的前景-背景分解框架，通过背景提示学习和局部相似性优化来解决现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前景-背景分解方法在少样本分布外检测中由于过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定的背景补丁提取策略，导致鲁棒性较低。

Method: 提出Mambo框架：1）学习背景提示获得包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性；2）使用局部类别相似性优化局部背景相似性；3）提出补丁自校准调整，根据样本多样性灵活选择背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，Mambo在分布外检测和近分布外检测设置方面相比现有最先进方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo通过减少对局部类别相似性的依赖和灵活的补丁选择策略，有效提升了少样本分布外检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种用于图像分割任务的数据集划分方法：IPS（迭代像素分层）和WDES（Wasserstein驱动的进化分层），以解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性和模型评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集缺乏代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但分割任务的多标签结构和类别不平衡使得扩展这些方法具有挑战性。

Method: 1. IPS：基于现有分层概念的标签感知采样方法；2. WDES：新颖的遗传算法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离来优化数据集划分间的标签分布相似性，证明在足够代数下具有全局最优性。

Result: 使用新提出的统计异质性指标评估，WDES始终产生更具代表性的划分。在街道场景、医学影像和卫星图像等多样化分割任务中应用WDES，降低了性能方差并改善了模型评估。

Conclusion: WDES在处理小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集时特别有价值，这些情况下传统划分策略最容易产生偏差。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Motivation: 现有细粒度分类模型依赖部件标注或复杂技术提取注意力图，但这些方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此作者提出利用层次化语义关联来改进细粒度分类。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义关联结构化为层次结构（分类学），作为端到端深度神经网络中的监督信号。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个知名数据集上的广泛实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最先进的近期方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 利用层次化语义关联作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需依赖裁剪技术或手动标注，为细粒度分类提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统依赖度增加，其安全性成为关键问题。ViT虽然相比CNN具有更好的性能和对抗扰动鲁棒性，但仍易受对抗性补丁攻击。研究旨在探索CNN中使用的对抗攻击技术在ViT分类模型中的可迁移性。

Method: 使用褶皱变换技术设计逼真的对抗性补丁，在人物与非人物分类任务中测试四个微调ViT模型的脆弱性。褶皱变换添加了类似穿着衣物时自然出现的细微几何扭曲。

Result: 实验评估显示不同ViT模型存在显著脆弱性差异：google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k攻击成功率为40.04%，facebook/dino-vitb16达到99.97%，google/vit-base-patch16-224为66.40%，facebook/dinov3-vitb16为65.17%。

Conclusion: 研究证实了对抗性补丁从CNN到ViT的跨架构可迁移性，预训练数据集规模和方法强烈影响模型对抗攻击的弹性。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念迁移方法在精确控制和编辑性方面存在局限，需要一种能够对视频不同组件进行细粒度控制的架构。

Method: 提出空间分解（前景主体、背景、运动流）和扩散时间步分解的双重分解策略，采用双到单流DiT架构，结合自监督预训练和Chain-of-Prompt机制进行渐进式生成。

Result: 在多样化的参考图像和场景上实现了高质量且可控的视频概念迁移，在视觉保真度和编辑性方面超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间步的双重分解实现了精确可控的视频概念迁移，为视频编辑领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖LLM推理来分析解析后的视觉信息，受限于静态感知阶段，需要增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力以实现人类水平的感知和理解。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知机制，通过强化学习和时空监督来优化推理，逐步聚焦高置信度的时空区域，并基于更新的文本预测进行引导。

Result: 在超过15个基准测试中，Videochat-R1.5模型相比Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型平均提升超过5%，涵盖视频对话、视频推理和时空感知任务。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了MLLM的性能，验证了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型学习内容对于AI在临床环境中的安全部署至关重要，现有研究多关注基于像素的解释方法，较少关注模型学习的文本概念，而这些概念可能更好地反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为"解析器"，在指定层用人类可解释的文本概念标记神经元，并量化其与领域知识的对齐度。

Result: 在乳腺摄影数据上训练的模型比未在乳腺摄影数据上训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念且更接近放射科医生的工作流程；针对特定任务微调会增强某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但会减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了关于卷积神经网络如何捕获乳腺摄影特定知识的见解，通过比较不同训练数据和微调策略的模型，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV是一个基于强化学习的视频推理框架，使用动态时间规整(DTW)的过程奖励来解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的过程不一致问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即使最终答案正确，中间推理过程也可能偏离视频动态，这影响了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MOSS-ChatV强化学习框架，使用基于动态时间规整(DTW)的规则化过程奖励，将推理轨迹与时间基础参考对齐，无需辅助奖励模型。同时构建了MOSS-Video基准数据集用于训练和评估。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有性能提升。该框架在不同架构(Qwen2.5-VL和Phi-2)上都表现出一致的改进。

Conclusion: MOSS-ChatV框架能够有效提升视频推理的过程一致性和稳定性，具有广泛的适用性，为多模态大语言模型的可靠视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成跟随指定相机轨迹的视频，同时保持一致的物体运动。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成与真实图像的界限变得模糊，引发了生成器与检测器之间的竞赛。本文旨在探索检测器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度对检测器性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现：增加维度通常增强检测器发现细微不一致的能力；简单数据集可被生成器近乎完美学习；高度多样性数据集可掩盖缺陷；中等复杂度数据集最有利于检测。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测有显著影响，中等复杂度数据集为检测器提供了最有利的条件，而极简或极复杂数据集都会削弱检测效果。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Result: 在零样本分类任务中表现出色，实现了竞争性的准确率，同时显著节省了计算资源，用户可以在单个部署模型中动态选择计算-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP通过小波基标记化实现了自适应分辨率推理，为视觉语言模型提供了高效灵活的计算框架，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Method: 对CLIP模型进行大规模量化评估，包括多种可靠性指标分析，并测试不同量化感知训练方法

Result: 量化持续改善预训练模型的校准性，即使在校准性下降的情况下OOD检测仍可提升，某些QAT方法能实现多方面性能提升

Conclusion: 量化在部署高效、可靠、鲁棒的视觉语言模型中具有超越传统角色的重要作用

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例，覆盖20个任务，基于200万个独特表格，其中88%保留了原始可视化。该数据集提供图像-HTML配对表示，用于训练视觉语言模型以提高表格理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性，且现有数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新表述。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含400万个示例，覆盖20个任务，基于200万个独特表格，88%保留原始可视化。每个示例包含图像-HTML配对表示、全面元数据和溯源信息。使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型在该数据集上进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调视觉语言模型提高了在已见和未见视觉表格理解任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来视觉表格理解模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Result: 在六个图像数据集上使用五种解释器进行实证评估，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面始终优于竞争方法，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级度量更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种控制解释保真度的有效途径，基于超像素的度量在识别关键特征方面表现更优。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过语义感知的早期融合、分层对齐学习和统一预训练策略，解决了语义基础弱、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡以及跨模态学习效率低的问题，在多个手语任务上取得了新的最先进结果。

Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个关键限制：1）语义基础弱，模型难以将骨架运动模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低，难以构建语义对齐的跨模态表示。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）语义感知早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态的深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，最大化不同模态特征在不同层次上的一致性；3）统一预训练框架，结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模。

Conclusion: 证明了语义信息丰富的预训练的影响，以及骨架数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Motivation: 文本到图像生成发展迅速，但评估输出是否真正捕捉提示中的对象、属性和关系仍是核心挑战。由于该领域的评估和进展报告直接依赖于这些指标，理解它们如何反映人类偏好至关重要。

Method: 对广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标进行广泛研究，分析它们在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果显示没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致：性能随组合问题类型而变化。VQA指标虽然流行但并非总是最优，某些嵌入指标在特定情况下更强。仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很少。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了仔细和透明地选择指标的重要性，既是为了可信的评估，也是为了将它们用作生成中的奖励模型。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

TL;DR: SlideMamba是一个结合Mamba架构和图神经网络(GNNs)的计算病理学框架，通过熵基自适应融合策略整合局部空间关系和长程上下文依赖，在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算病理学需要从全切片图像(WSIs)中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，但现有方法在捕捉局部空间关系和长程上下文依赖方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SlideMamba框架，集成Mamba模块(擅长捕捉长程全局依赖)和GNNs(强调细粒度短程空间交互)，采用基于熵的自适应融合策略动态平衡两个分支的贡献。

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，SlideMamba达到PRAUC 0.751±0.05，优于MIL(0.491±0.042)、Trans-MIL(0.39±0.017)、Mamba-only(0.664±0.063)、GNN-only(0.748±0.091)和GAT-Mamba(0.703±0.075)。

Conclusion: 集成架构结合熵基自适应融合策略展现出强大性能，为计算病理学中的空间解析预测建模任务提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有的3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每个样本选择一种控制模态，偏重较难信号（如骨骼姿态）而降低较易信号（如点云）的权重。

Result: 实验表明额外控制信号提高了生成准确性，实现了几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态控制信号显著提升了3D资产生成的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，需要确保模型基于正确原因进行决策。现有方法依赖专家标注，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种无需人工标注的可扩展方法，能够促进更可靠和认知合理的决策过程，有效减少模型对捷径的依赖。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent

Conclusion: SQ-InstructBLIP通过生成图像感知的信息性子问题，有效提升了多步推理任务的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注对齐性，检查提示中指定元素是否出现，但忽略了模型在提示之外生成的内容。需要明确定义T2I模型中的幻觉现象。

Method: 将T2I幻觉定义为偏见驱动的偏差，并提出包含属性、关系和对象幻觉的三类分类法。

Result: 该框架为评估设定了上限，揭示了隐藏的偏见，为T2I模型提供了更丰富的评估基础。

Conclusion: 提出的幻觉定义和分类方法为文本到图像生成模型提供了更全面的评估框架，能够更好地识别和理解模型中的偏见问题。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，通过保留VGGT的固有优势并针对跨实例语义匹配场景进行适配，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：几何歧义（依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构）和最近邻规则（像素级匹配忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持）。需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 保留VGGT早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，添加语义头实现双向对应；在数据稀缺情况下通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方法适配语义匹配场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优异，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功将VGGT从单实例几何匹配适配到跨实例语义匹配，在数据稀缺条件下实现了更好的几何感知和匹配性能。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

*Xinyu Liu,Guolei Sun,Cheng Wang,Yixuan Yuan,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MedVSR框架，专门用于解决医学视频超分辨率中的对齐困难和伪影问题，通过跨状态空间传播和内部状态空间重建模块，在多种医学场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但由于硬件限制和生理约束难以获取。现有VSR模型在处理医学视频时面临相机抖动、噪声、帧间突变等独特挑战，导致光流误差和对齐困难，且容易引入伪影和扭曲特征误导医生诊断。

Method: 提出MedVSR框架：1) 跨状态空间传播(CSSP)模块，通过将远距离帧投影为状态空间模型中的控制矩阵，选择性地传播一致且信息丰富的特征到邻近帧进行有效对齐；2) 内部状态空间重建(ISSR)模块，通过联合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合来增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Result: 在包括内窥镜和白内障手术在内的四种医学场景数据集上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和效率方面显著优于现有VSR模型。

Conclusion: MedVSR通过创新的跨状态空间传播和内部状态空间重建模块，有效解决了医学视频超分辨率中的对齐困难和伪影问题，为医学诊断提供了更可靠的视频增强解决方案。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法解决GRPO训练中的梯度消失问题，并发布大规模长链思维数据和RL问答对，开源多模态推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态推理模型面临两个主要限制：缺乏高质量长链思维数据，以及强化学习训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布包含160万条长链思维数据和1.5万条RL问答对的大规模资源；开源多尺度多模态推理模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了所提数据和VAS方法的有效性，通过消融研究深入分析了各组件贡献，理论上证明了奖励方差对策略梯度幅度的下界约束。

Conclusion: VAS方法能有效稳定策略优化，发布的数据和模型为社区提供了标准化基准，代码、数据和检查点已开源。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于Prithvi-EO视觉Transformer架构的海洋科学基础模型，通过Sentinel-3 OLCI数据进行预训练，并在叶绿素浓度估算和海洋初级生产力估算两个下游任务中验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用在大量无标签数据上预训练的基础模型，解决海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且收集成本高的问题，改变海洋科学中的AI应用。

Method: 采用Prithvi-EO视觉Transformer架构，使用Sentinel-3 OLCI数据进行预训练，然后通过微调应用于叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估算两个海洋地球观测任务。

Result: 模型在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉详细海洋颜色空间模式方面表现出色，同时与点观测数据匹配良好，证明了自训练基础模型在海洋监测中的实用性。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的图像合成框架，通过流形引导锚点损失、降噪抑制指导和自适应背景融合，实现高保真目标插入，解决了复杂光照和多样化高分辨率输入的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现有扩散模型虽然编码了物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏有效框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE引入流形引导锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器指导潜在表示以保持目标忠实性；提出降噪抑制指导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench上的实验显示，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个无需训练的高质量图像合成解决方案，能够有效处理复杂光照条件和高分辨率输入，并引入了新的基准测试集ComplexCompo来评估模型性能。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了QuantVGGT，首个针对视觉几何基础变换器(VGGT)的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样化采样技术，在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型如VGGT虽然取得了显著进展，但其巨大的计算和内存成本严重阻碍了实际部署。后训练量化(PTQ)在压缩十亿级VGGT时面临独特挑战：数据无关的特殊token导致重尾激活分布，而3D数据的多视角特性使校准样本选择高度不稳定。

Method: 1. 双平滑细粒度量化：集成预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑，缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2. 噪声过滤多样化采样：通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样化校准簇以确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: 在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，同时重建精度保持在完整精度模型的98%以上，在不同基准测试和位宽下均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有巨大优势和实用性，显著提升了VGGT模型的实际部署可行性。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in
https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen是一个结合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理的文本到视频生成框架，通过神经牛顿动力学(NND)建模牛顿运动，解决现有模型物理一致性和可控性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型存在物理一致性差和可控性不足的问题，经常产生不真实的运动（如物体向上坠落、速度和方向突变），且缺乏精确参数控制。这源于模型仅从外观学习运动分布，缺乏对底层动力学的理解。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是训练神经牛顿动力学(NND)来建模和预测各种牛顿运动，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程，联合利用数据先验和动力学指导。

Result: NewtonGen能够实现物理一致的视频合成，并具有精确的参数控制能力。

Conclusion: 通过集成数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理，NewtonGen解决了文本到视频生成中的物理一致性和可控性瓶颈问题。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Result: 通过大规模用户研究评估，SD3.5-Flash在性能上持续优于现有的多步方法，实现了从手机到桌面电脑等不同硬件配置上的快速生成和内存高效部署。

Conclusion: 该框架使先进的生成式AI真正实现了实际部署的普及化，为各种设备提供了高质量的图像生成能力。

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 当前社区贡献平台的数据集治理模式存在严重缺陷，需要改进以支持负责任的医疗数据管理和AI算法开发。

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

FM in the context of sub-symbolic AI-enabled RAS and examine the evolution of
how FM is used over time in this field. This work complements a pre-existing
survey in this area and we examine how this research area has matured over

observed in a previous survey. Additionally, it recognized new trends that were
not considered previously including a noticeable increase in adopting Formal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型和机器人技术的快速发展，视觉语言导航成为具身智能体的关键任务。连续环境中的VLN特别具有挑战性，需要智能体同时理解自然语言指令、感知环境并规划底层动作。

Method: 使用简化的路径点预测器在抽象障碍物地图上生成线性可达路径点，构建动态更新的拓扑图并记录访问历史。将图和访问信息编码到提示中，使MLLM能够进行空间结构和探索历史的推理，鼓励探索并具备局部路径规划能力。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

Result: 在波士顿动力Spot机器人上的实验表明，与开环基线相比，该交互感知方法在楼梯上推挤物体时获得了更高的任务成功率和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 通过结合本体感觉反馈和交互感知的状态估计，能够有效解决四足机器人在单腿推挤过程中物体遮挡问题，提高在复杂地形上的操作性能。

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ是一种基于学习进展的查询策略，只在学习停滞或恶化时请求人类反馈，显著减少了不必要的反馈请求，在保持高性能的同时降低了反馈成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中人类反馈成本高昂且有限，现有的人机协同强化学习方法假设反馈充足，限制了其在物理机器人部署中的实用性。

Method: 提出了SPARQ策略，通过监控学习进展，只在学习停滞或恶化时请求人类反馈，避免不必要的查询。在PyBullet模拟环境中使用UR5机器人进行方块抓取任务评估。

Result: SPARQ实现了近乎完美的任务成功率，与始终查询策略性能相当，但只消耗约一半的反馈预算。相比随机查询提供更稳定高效的学习，显著优于无反馈训练。

Conclusion: 基于进展的选择性查询策略能够使人机协同强化学习在现实人类努力约束下更加高效和可扩展。

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Conclusion: GraspFactory数据集为训练大规模机器人抓取模型提供了重要资源，有助于解决机器人抓取在多样化物体上的泛化问题。

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种推理时潜在激活编辑框架，可在不修改预训练策略权重的情况下，通过监测和编辑中间激活来提升多四旋翼无人机导航的安全性，显著减少碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在复杂领域取得进展，但训练好的策略在障碍物密集环境中仍容易发生碰撞。重新训练或微调成本高且可能降低已学技能，需要一种轻量级的后部署优化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：在线分类器监测中间激活检测不良行为状态；激活编辑模块选择性修改标记的激活，使策略转向更安全状态。具体通过训练潜在碰撞世界模型预测未来碰撞前激活，促使更早的规避响应。

Result: 在仿真和真实Crazyflie实验中，LAE实现了统计显著的碰撞减少（比未编辑基线减少近90%累积碰撞），大幅提高了无碰撞轨迹比例，同时保持任务完成能力。

Conclusion: LAE作为一种轻量级范式，可在资源受限硬件上实现学习机器人策略的后部署优化，为安全关键应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

outperforms a generalist policy by up to 16% in success rate and achieves lower
tracking errors as the velocity target increases, particularly on low-friction
and discontinuous terrains, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness
across mixed-terrain scenarios.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

Conclusion: 该触觉共享控制框架有效促进了人类驾驶员在高级驾驶任务中的技能获取，证明了其在复杂驾驶场景中的教学价值。

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Result: MI训练达到93.1%准确率和14.8 bit/min的平均信息传输率；AR神经反馈显著改善持续控制（SCI=0.210）并达到最高ITR（21.3 bit/min）；闭环抓取达到97.2%成功率，具有良好效率和用户报告的控制感。

Conclusion: AR反馈显著稳定了基于EEG的控制，所提出的框架实现了稳健的零接触抓取，推动了辅助机器人应用和未来人机交互模式的发展。

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索方法在超网络训练方面不足，且很少关注实际机器人硬件资源限制，需要开发资源感知的NAS方法。

Method: 提出子网互蒸馏概念，使用三明治规则采样所有子网进行互蒸馏；采用解耦知识蒸馏损失增强logits蒸馏性能；使用三种机器人边缘硬件数据训练延迟代理预测器，在搜索阶段估计硬件推理延迟；进行统一的多目标进化搜索。

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，能够有效平衡模型精度和硬件推理延迟。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上的仿真和现实实验表明，RuN在训练效率和最终性能上都优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: RuN框架能够实现稳定自然的步态和平滑的走跑转换，在广泛速度范围内表现出色。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to

We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

TL;DR: BIM2RDT框架将静态BIM转换为动态的机器人就绪数字孪生，通过SG-ICP算法和实时安全监控提升施工安全管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有BIM数据与实时现场条件之间的差距，提升施工行业的数字管理和安全执行能力。

Method: 集成BIM几何语义信息、IoT传感器活动数据和机器人视觉空间数据，使用SG-ICP点云配准算法和LLM推理，结合YOLOE目标检测和Shi-Tomasi角点检测。

Result: SG-ICP相比标准ICP在特征遮挡场景中RMSE降低64.3%-88.3%，HAV集成能在超过暴露限值时触发警告。

Conclusion: BIM2RDT框架成功将静态BIM转化为动态数字孪生，显著提升了施工安全管理和机器人操作的准确性。

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言指令与建筑信息模型语义地图融合的框架，通过Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合将LLM视为传感器，生成上下文感知的排斥增益来改进机器人路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在建筑领域，BIM模型包含丰富的环境自然语言描述，需要将自然语言指令与机器人任务规划相结合，实现更安全、上下文感知的路径规划。

Method: 使用Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合方法，将障碍物的设计时排斥系数视为Beta随机变量，LLM返回的危险分数作为伪计数来更新参数，生成连续上下文感知的排斥增益，增强基于欧几里得距离的势场成本启发式。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在路径鲁棒性和有效性方面都取得了定性和定量的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数值稳定的方式，可以链接多个自然命令，使机器人能够规划更安全、上下文感知的路径，并可集成到任何学习或经典AI框架中。

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

TL;DR: RobotDancing是一个简单可扩展的框架，通过预测残差关节目标来显式修正动力学差异，实现人形机器人长时间高动态运动跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人的长时间高动态运动跟踪仍然脆弱，因为绝对关节指令无法补偿模型-实际系统的不匹配，导致误差累积。

Method: 采用端到端管道，包括训练、模拟到模拟验证和零样本模拟到真实部署，使用单阶段强化学习设置，具有统一的观测、奖励和超参数配置。

Result: 在Unitree G1上评估重定向的LAFAN1舞蹈序列，并在H1/H1-2上验证迁移，能够跟踪多分钟的高能量行为（跳跃、旋转、侧手翻），并以高运动跟踪质量零样本部署到硬件。

Conclusion: RobotDancing框架能够有效解决人形机器人长时间高动态运动跟踪中的模型-实际系统不匹配问题，实现高质量的零样本部署。

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言感知的SLAM-free导航框架，用语义推理和轻量拓扑表示替代密集几何建图，通过分层感知和分层规划实现腿式机器人的鲁棒导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在腿式机器人导航中存在快速运动下的脆弱性、标定需求高、传感器漂移等问题，且缺乏任务驱动的语义推理能力。

Method: 采用分层视觉语言感知模块融合场景级和物体级信息，构建语义概率拓扑地图，结合LLM全局推理和视觉局部规划的分层规划策略，与强化学习运动控制器集成。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境实验中，在语义准确性、规划质量和导航成功率方面均取得显著提升，消融研究验证了分层感知和精细局部规划的必要性。

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了SLAM-free、视觉语言驱动的导航新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心建图转向语义驱动决策。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Motivation: 传统视觉SLAM系统在低纹理环境、尺度模糊和挑战性视觉条件下表现不佳，而现有的基于神经网络的点云回归方法虽然能恢复高保真3D场景几何，但往往忽略了概率多传感器信息融合的优势。

Method: 提出Sim(3)基于视觉对齐约束（Hessian形式）集成到通用度量尺度SE(3)因子图中进行有效信息融合，采用分层因子图设计，支持实时滑动窗口优化和具有激进闭环的全局优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试和自收集数据集上的评估表明，相比现有的视觉中心多传感器SLAM系统，在准确性和鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion框架成功将前馈点云回归与多传感器信息融合，实现了高精度和鲁棒的视觉SLAM性能，代码将开源以支持可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

TL;DR: SemSight是一个概率性鸟瞰图预测模型，用于多层级场景语义预测，能够推断未知区域的结构布局、全局场景上下文和目标区域分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单个物体或几何占用地图，缺乏对房间级语义结构的建模能力，而合理的未知区域预测对于高效导航和环境理解至关重要。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器网络作为核心架构，引入掩码约束监督策略，在2000个室内布局图上模拟前沿驱动探索构建数据集，包含40000个序列化自我中心观察与完整语义地图配对。

Result: 实验结果显示SemSight在未知区域关键功能类别的预测性能得到提升，在结构一致性(SC)和区域识别准确率(PA)等指标上优于非掩码监督方法，在闭环模拟中提高了导航效率，减少了搜索目标区域的步骤数。

Conclusion: SemSight通过掩码约束监督策略有效推断未知区域的语义结构，在场景语义预测和导航效率方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

Motivation: 端到端机器人操作策略具有显著潜力，但现有基于VLM/VLA模型的神经网络在实际大规模部署中性能不足。需要开发通用、准确且可靠的端到端操作策略。

Method: 提出CoMOK公式作为神经策略的动作表示，通过定向关键点实现自然泛化，支持多阶段任务、多模态行为和可变形物体处理。

Conclusion: CoMOK公式为机器人操作提供了一种通用、准确且可靠的端到端解决方案，在多样化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 采用闭环系统，结合基于记忆的经验检索机制和动态工具包，通过记忆-工具协同推理来改善环境交互、推理和决策能力。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，3B参数的MTRDrive模型达到PDMS 88.3，驾驶指标得分79.8%，规划准确率82.6%；在Roadwork-VLM基准测试中零样本泛化达到80.2%的驾驶指标得分。

Conclusion: MTRDrive展示了推动自动驾驶向更安全可靠系统发展的潜力，特别是在复杂场景下的鲁棒推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

Motivation: 随着可微分物理的成熟，其在模型预测控制、机器人设计优化和神经PDE求解器等下游应用中的作用日益重要。然而，可微分模拟器提供的导数信息可能出现突变或完全消失，阻碍了基于梯度的优化器的收敛。

Result: 实验表明，即使从简单的初始化开始，本文提出的接触模型也能发现复杂的、接触丰富的控制信号，成功执行一系列下游运动和控制任务。

Conclusion: 通过设计满足特定性质的接触模型，可以有效解决可微分物理模拟中的梯度不稳定问题，显著提升梯度优化器的性能，为各种下游应用提供更可靠的导数信息。

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶端到端规划中面临时空不对齐问题，规划器需要基于过去感知数据预测未来动作，导致世界观不一致，限制了性能上限。

Method: 1) TISA模块将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步的一致自我中心坐标系；2) 运动学动作预测头确保物理可行轨迹；3) 多目标DPO后训练提供细粒度驾驶行为反馈。

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上达到89.8 PDMS的SOTA性能，在自回归模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: TISA模块有效解决了时空不对齐问题，结合DPO多目标训练显著提升了自动驾驶规划性能，为端到端规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池拆卸需要精确的多机器人协调、短而可靠的运动以及在杂乱动态场景中的鲁棒碰撞安全。现有方法在运动紧凑性和安全性方面存在不足。

Method: 四层TAMP框架，结合符号任务规划、成本感知分配、TP-GMM引导的运动规划，使用立体视觉进行实时组件定位，OctoMap 3D映射和FCL碰撞检测。

Result: 相比RRTConnect基线，末端执行器路径长度平均减少63.3%，完成时间减少8.1%，单臂扫掠体积显著减小（R1: 0.583→0.139 m³; R2: 0.696→0.252 m³），相互重叠减少47%。

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$
($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved
autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in
unstructured, dynamic environments.

*Sibo Li,Qianyue Hao,Yu Shang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KeyWorld是一个改进文本条件机器人世界模型的框架，通过将transformer计算集中在少量语义关键帧上，同时使用轻量卷积模型填充中间帧，实现5.68倍加速并提高生成视频的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人世界模型存在推理速度慢和生成轨迹物理合理性不足的问题，主要源于逐帧生成方法的冗余计算以及忽视关键转换的语义重要性。

Method: 首先通过迭代简化机器人运动轨迹识别重要转换，获得真实关键帧；然后训练DiT模型从文本任务描述推理生成物理意义关键帧；最后使用轻量插值器高效重建完整视频。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，相比逐帧生成基线实现5.68倍加速，关注运动感知关键帧进一步提升了生成视频的物理有效性，特别是在复杂任务上。

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制和其他需要高效有效世界模型的领域中部署世界模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Motivation: 当前通用机器人领域使用的概率模型（如扩散模型）存在推理计算成本高和无法量化输出不确定性的问题，而模型的可信度对于可靠通用机器人至关重要，需要能够提供置信度测量。

Method: 引入Normalizing Flows Policy，基于Normalizing Flows构建视觉运动策略学习模型，通过消融研究验证了使Normalizing Flows在该领域表现良好的关键架构和训练技术。

Conclusion: Normalizing Flows是扩散模型的自然且强大替代方案，能够提供统计上可靠的置信度测量和高效推理过程，适用于通用机器人领域。

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

Motivation: 现有的基于雷达或摄像头的无人机边缘检测方法部署成本高且计算需求大，不适合轻量级无人机。需要一种低成本、高效率的边缘检测方案。

Method: 将地面效应从飞行控制的'敌人'转变为'朋友'，通过理论分析、算法设计和实现，利用无人机基本姿态传感器和飞行命令检测地面效应变化，这些变化通常表明无人机飞越两种材料的边界。

Result: 系统达到高检测精度，平均检测距离误差为0.051米，比基线方法性能提升86%，仅需43毫瓦功耗。

Conclusion: AirTouch证明了地面效应作为新感知方式的可行性，实现了低成本、高效率的场景边缘检测，在资源效率和检测能力方面具有独特优势。

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

Motivation: 传统机器人教学需要物理演示，数据收集困难且难以扩展。本文探索使用人类草图和行为标注作为替代方案，以解决演示数据集难以扩展的问题。

Method: 提出CrossInstruct框架，将跨模态指令作为上下文输入到基础视觉语言模型中，通过迭代查询小型微调模型，在多个2D视图中合成运动，最终融合为3D运动轨迹分布。

Result: 在基准模拟任务和真实硬件上严格评估，证明无需额外微调即可有效工作，并为后续强化学习提供强初始化策略。

Conclusion: CrossInstruct通过跨模态指令成功教导机器人行为，超越了有限指令示例的环境，为机器人学习提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 解决无人机通过缆绳交互平衡球体的任务，探索强化学习在复杂控制任务中的潜力，并与传统PID控制器进行对比分析。

Method: 提出分层控制框架，将高层平衡策略与底层无人机控制解耦，使用强化学习训练高层决策策略，并与相同分层结构下的PID控制器进行对比。

Result: 仿真结果显示，强化学习策略在相同分层结构中优于精心调谐的PID控制器，其优势主要来自于能够有效利用更丰富的状态观测信息。

Conclusion: 强化学习的优势不在于改进的参数调谐或固有的非线性映射能力，而在于其有效利用丰富状态观测的能力，这强调了全面状态表示在学习型系统中的关键作用。

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Motivation: 可靠的双臂抓取对于操作大型复杂物体至关重要，但现有方法通常将任务分解为两个独立的抓取提议，依赖于区域先验或启发式方法，限制了泛化能力且无法提供稳定性保证。

Method: 提出DAGDiff框架，在SE(3)×SE(3)空间中直接去噪生成抓取对，通过几何感知、稳定性感知和碰撞感知的引导项来指导扩散过程，确保物理有效性和力闭合合规性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够直接在真实世界点云上为未见过的物体生成双臂抓取，并在异构双臂设置上成功执行抓取和提升操作。

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

Conclusion: ReasonNav通过集成类人导航行为和视觉语言模型的推理能力，显著提高了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

Conclusion: SEEC框架实现了精确鲁棒的臂端稳定控制，能够适应未见过的运动控制器，无需额外训练，在人形机器人运动操作任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand

lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了BiNoMaP框架，通过双手机器人配置和几何感知优化方法，从视频演示中学习非抓取式操作技能，实现类别级泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非抓取式操作在机器人领域研究不足，传统方法依赖单臂配置和外部辅助，难以处理接触丰富且分析困难的任务。

Result: 在多种代表性双手任务和不同物体类别上验证了BiNoMaP的有效性、效率、多功能性和优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: BiNoMaP为双手机器人非抓取式操作提供了通用解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性，实现了从实例级复制到类别级泛化的突破。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

TL;DR: GMP³是一个多阶段全局路径规划框架，为无人机在复杂环境中生成动态可行的三维轨迹，通过SE(3)李群扩展传统路径规划，结合强化学习实现协同策略更新，并开发了DroneManager地面控制软件进行实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路径规划方法在三维复杂环境中难以同时处理位置和姿态的动态约束，需要开发能够联合学习平移运动和旋转动力学的新框架。

Method: 提出基于SE(3)李群的路径规划框架，引入改进的Bellman算子支持强化学习策略更新，采用分布式架构实现多智能体协同规划，通过共识机制共享策略信息。

Conclusion: GMP³框架成功解决了无人机在复杂3D环境中的动态轨迹规划问题，通过分布式协同和SE(3)空间规划实现了位置和姿态的联合优化。

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The
open-source implementation is available at

Motivation: 现有运动生成模型经常忽略人类运动分类学提供的丰富层次结构信息，导致生成的运动与底层层次结构脱节。

Method: 将GPDM的动态先验扩展到双曲流形，整合分类学感知的归纳偏差，提出三种生成机制：两种概率递归方法和基于拉回度量测地线的方法。

Conclusion: GPHDM成功地将层次分类学结构与时序动态相结合，为机器人运动生成提供了既保持结构又确保物理一致性的新方法。

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

Motivation: 生成流网络使用流匹配损失学习生成对象的随机策略，但目前缺乏多智能体生成流网络的理论框架。

Method: 提出了MA-GFlowNets理论框架，包含集中流网络、独立流网络、联合流网络及其条件版本四种算法，基于局部-全局原则进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的框架在性能上优于强化学习和基于MCMC的方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets理论框架为多智能体协作生成对象提供了理论基础，通过局部-全局原则实现了有效的集中训练与分散执行。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，取代了传统的顺序生成方式，在保持无损验证成本的同时实现了显著的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来生成N个token，这限制了推理速度的进一步提升。FastEagle旨在通过消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖性来加速LLM推理。

Method: FastEagle采用非自回归级联草稿器，用轻量级层级级联替换时间步骤，并通过层级监督训练来减轻错误累积。结合保留无损验证成本的约束草稿树结构。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务（MT-Bench、HumanEval、GSM8K等）上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下始终优于EAGLE-3的加速效果，同时保持可比较的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖性是实现无损LLM推理加速的实用路径，FastEagle证明了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习参数化方法(mloz)，用于在气候模型中交互式模拟臭氧变化，比传统化学方案快31倍，且可在不同气候模型间迁移使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于大气化学方案计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这限制了气候敏感性模拟的准确性。

Method: 使用机器学习参数化方法，仅需大气温度廓线作为输入，就能模拟对流层和平流层的日臭氧变化和趋势，支持与准两年振荡的双向相互作用。

Result: mloz在UKESM模型中比化学方案快31倍，仅占模型总运行时间的不到4%，且在ICON模型中也成功迁移使用，表现出良好的稳定性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望在缺乏交互化学的CMIP级气候模型中广泛应用，特别是在关注臭氧趋势和变化对大气反馈过程影响的气候敏感性模拟中。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，用户隐私保护需求日益迫切。EEG数据可能泄露个人身份信息，需要开发既能保护隐私又能保持数据效用的方法。

Method: 使用基于transformer的自编码器对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，在自动睡眠分期任务上评估匿名化前后数据的重识别风险和效用保持情况。

Result: 结果显示，EEG信号的重识别能力可以显著降低，同时仍能保持机器学习任务的效用。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡EEG数据的隐私保护和实用价值，为EEG数据的隐私安全使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

Motivation: 随着影响力估计工具在数据估值和负责任机器学习中的广泛应用，需要研究这些分数本身是否可能被对抗性操纵，以评估其安全性和可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种实用的攻击方法，通过计算输入的伪逆来产生高度记忆化的样本，仅需要黑盒访问模型输出，计算开销适中。

Result: 在广泛的图像分类任务中实证验证了攻击的有效性，表明即使是最先进的代理方法也容易受到针对性分数操纵。理论分析揭示了在对抗性扰动下记忆度分数的稳定性条件。

Conclusion: 研究发现影响力估计存在关键漏洞，强调了需要开发鲁棒防御措施的必要性。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习方法主要使用两种表示结构框架：对比表示和时序距离，但各有局限性。本文旨在统一这两种框架，结合各自的优势。

Method: 使用拟度量表示空间结构（三角不等式）和额外约束来学习后续表示，能够利用拟度量距离参数化在次优数据和随机环境中学习最优目标到达距离。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，在拟度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了蒙特卡洛对比强化学习方法的稳定性和长时程能力，以及拟度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力，实现了两种框架的优势互补。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一个基于规则引导的多模态聚类框架，通过将领域特定约束嵌入到表示学习中，结合VAE架构和LLM生成的规则，实现更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，难以捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束。需要将领域特定约束直接整合到表示学习过程中。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，将显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征嵌入到统一的潜在空间中，通过规则一致性和违反惩罚在损失函数中强制约束合规性。规则由LLM生成并构建为知识图谱。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生了更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改善了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: 通过将规则编码与学习表示相结合，DARTVAE比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂、知识密集型场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Method: 基于树结构矩阵的高效求逆算法，将稀疏注意力与状态空间模型的循环依赖性相结合。

Result: 开发了一种新颖算法，能够有效降低计算和内存复杂度。

Conclusion: 该算法成功结合了稀疏注意力和状态空间模型的优点，为解决注意力机制的高复杂度问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

*Oscar Leong,Yann Traonmilin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为基于扩散模型的逆问题求解算法建立了理论框架，证明了当数据分布集中在低维模型集上时，噪声卷积分数可解释为时变投影，并推导了在受限等距性质下的定量收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恢复高维信号是逆问题的核心挑战。虽然生成扩散模型在提供数据驱动先验方面取得了显著经验成功，但严格的恢复保证仍然有限。

Method: 开发理论框架分析确定性扩散基算法，将噪声卷积分数解释为时变投影，将先前的扩散先验算法视为具有变化投影的广义投影梯度下降方法。

Result: 当感知矩阵在模型集上满足受限等距性质时，可以推导出明确依赖于噪声调度表的定量收敛率。在低维紧凸集和低秩高斯混合模型等数据分布上应用该框架。

Conclusion: 在低秩高斯混合模型设置中，尽管底层模型集是非凸的，仍能建立全局收敛保证。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

TL;DR: MDBench是一个开源基准测试框架，用于评估动态系统的模型发现方法，评估了12种算法在14个PDE和63个ODE上的表现，发现线性方法和遗传编程方法分别在PDE和ODE上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对动态模型发现的全面基准测试，现有工作主要关注单个方程的识别，需要系统评估模型发现方法的性能。

Method: 开发MDBench框架，在14个偏微分方程和63个常微分方程上评估12种算法，考虑不同噪声水平，使用导数预测精度、模型复杂度和方程保真度等指标。

Result: 线性方法在PDE上获得最低预测误差，遗传编程方法在ODE上表现最佳，线性模型对噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MDBench通过提供严格的基准测试框架和丰富的动态系统数据集，加速了模型发现方法的发展，支持系统评估和改进方程精度与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RNPC，一种对抗性攻击鲁棒的神经概率电路，通过类级集成推理方法提升对抗鲁棒性，同时保持良性输入的高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经概率电路（NPC）虽然具有可解释性和高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模型容易受到对抗性攻击，通过微小扰动操纵属性预测，从而影响最终预测结果。

Method: 提出RNPC，引入新颖的类级集成推理方法，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。理论分析表明RNPC相比NPC具有可证明的对抗鲁棒性提升。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证结果显示，RNPC相比现有概念瓶颈模型实现了更优的对抗鲁棒性，同时在良性输入上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: RNPC是首个针对识别模块对抗性攻击的鲁棒神经概率电路，通过理论分析和实证验证证明了其对抗鲁棒性的显著提升。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球超5.37亿人，预计2045年将达7.83亿。早期风险分层可从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的泛化性能。

Method: 构建两种混合分类器：XGBoost+随机森林和支持向量机+逻辑回归。采用防泄漏的标准化流程，在主要数据集上训练并冻结流程，在PIMA队列上进行外部验证。

Result: XGB-RF在主要数据集上AUROC约0.995，AUPRC约0.998；在PIMA数据集上AUROC约0.990，AUPRC约0.959，均优于SVM-LR。阈值指标也显示XGB-RF性能更好。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中始终优于SVM-LR，外部衰减较小且校准可接受。支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健可转移方法。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

Motivation: 扩散模型在科学领域表现出强大的生成能力，但经常产生违反物理定律的输出。现有方法依赖DPS式值函数近似，这会引入显著误差并导致训练不稳定和推理效率低下。

Method: PIRF方法：1）将物理约束作为稀疏奖励优化问题；2）直接计算轨迹级奖励并反向传播梯度；3）采用层级截断反向传播方法利用物理奖励的时空局部性；4）使用基于权重的正则化方案提高效率。

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下始终实现优越的物理约束执行效果，超越了传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有巨大潜力，PIRF通过避免值函数近似和采用高效优化策略，为物理感知生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

TL;DR: 本文通过全局敏感性分析研究了贝叶斯神经网络超参数对预测准确性和不确定性量化的影响，发现超参数之间存在复杂交互作用，建议使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化来改善BNNs在实际应用中的不确定性量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络在实际应用中难以获得准确的不确定性量化，部分原因是训练过程中的近似方法和超参数选择困难。超参数数量多且对结果影响不透明，需要系统研究其影响。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在不同超参数设置下系统评估贝叶斯神经网络的性能表现，分析超参数之间的交互作用。

Result: 研究发现许多超参数之间存在交互作用，共同影响预测准确性和不确定性量化性能。超参数选择对BNNs的不确定性量化准确性至关重要。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法来辅助维度约简和超参数选择，以确保贝叶斯神经网络获得准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Conclusion: Neural FMM能够有效学习椭圆偏微分方程的格林算子，为FMM与机器学习的结合提供了新途径。

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

Motivation: 传统黑盒方法无法捕捉视频流中不同特征与用户体验之间的复杂关系，且缺乏可解释性，需要开发既能准确预测QoE又能提供透明解释的模型。

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture

evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出一类稳定的、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方案（EES方案），用于神经随机微分方程，解决了传统可逆求解器在复杂模型和大步长下的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难：离散化再优化方法梯度准确但内存成本高；优化再离散化方法内存成本恒定但梯度近似误差大且评估慢。代数可逆求解器虽然承诺内存效率和梯度精度，但现有方法如Reversible Heun方案在复杂模型和大步长下不稳定。

Method: 引入一类新颖的稳定、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方案，称为显式有效对称（EES）方案。这些方案保留了可逆求解器的优点，同时克服了它们的不稳定性。

Result: 通过数值实验证明，EES方案具有优越的稳定性和可靠性，能够在没有严格步长或模型复杂度限制的情况下实现内存高效的训练。

Conclusion: EES方案为神经SDE的可扩展和准确训练提供了实用的基础，实现了内存效率和梯度精度的平衡。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Result: 该方法不仅通过了自一致性测试，而且优于传统的基于分数的扩散互信息估计器，在高互信息情况下仍能保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型可以有效地用于互信息估计，提供了一种直接且可扩展的方法，在估计性能方面超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架成功解决了技能增量学习中技能-策略兼容性问题，实现了技能改进对下游策略的自动增强。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

TL;DR: 提出了个性化联邦字典学习(PFedDL)框架，通过分解站点特定字典为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件，解决多站点fMRI研究中数据隐私和站点异质性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据隐私约束和多站点功能磁共振成像研究中站点特定异质性导致的非独立同分布数据阻碍了通用模型的发展。

Method: 在每个站点执行独立字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件，通过联邦聚合更新全局原子，独立优化本地原子以捕获站点特定变异性。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非独立同分布数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL框架能够在不共享原始数据的情况下实现跨站点协作建模，有效处理数据隐私和站点异质性挑战。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

*Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究使用MM-SHAP框架量化音频大语言模型中各模态对输出的贡献，发现在MuChoMusic基准上表现更好的模型更依赖文本回答问题，但音频模态仍能成功定位关键声音事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型能够进行类似人类的音乐对话，但不确定它们是否真正在听音频还是仅使用文本推理。需要量化每个模态对模型输出的贡献。

Method: 采用基于Shapley值的MM-SHAP框架，这是一种与性能无关的评分方法，用于量化每个模态对模型预测的相对贡献。在MuChoMusic基准上评估了两个模型。

Result: 准确率更高的模型更依赖文本来回答问题，但进一步检查发现，即使整体音频贡献较低，模型仍能成功定位关键声音事件，表明音频并未被完全忽略。

Conclusion: 这是MM-SHAP在音频大语言模型中的首次应用，为可解释AI和音频研究的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习中的自主探索严重依赖有效的内在动机，但现有好奇心机制往往将环境随机性与有意义的新颖性混淆，且忽视了包含潜在任务动态的同伴行为新颖性。

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴自适应校准探索行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架，能够鲁棒地过滤噪声惊喜信号，并通过动态校准内在好奇心与推断的多智能体上下文来指导探索。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试套件上的实证结果表明，使用CERMIC进行探索在稀疏奖励环境中显著优于现有最优算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过理论支撑的内在奖励生成，鼓励智能体探索具有高信息增益的状态转换，有效解决了多智能体强化学习中的探索挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵化学计算（如耦合簇方法）时面临的两个关键问题：如何找到最短执行时间的配置和如何最小化资源使用成本。

Method: 评估多种机器学习模型和策略，基于CCSD应用在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上的运行参数数据，使用梯度提升模型进行执行时间预测，并采用主动学习策略在数据收集成本高时减少实验次数。

Result: 梯度提升模型在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差分别为0.023和0.073；主动学习策略仅需约450个实验就能达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效预测化学计算应用的资源需求，梯度提升模型表现优异，主动学习策略在数据稀缺情况下仍能提供可接受的预测精度。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感，需要建立理论框架来理解并预测稳定演示的最小数量。

Method: 基于高维亚高斯表示建立非渐近下界，分析协方差的谱特性，提出两阶段可观测估计器配合单次校准方法。

Result: 实验显示预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论作为保守但可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小差距。

Conclusion: 研究连接了谱覆盖与稳定上下文学习，弥合理论与部署之间的差距，提高了大规模提示在有限样本场景下的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

TL;DR: 提出了Bispectral Optimal Transport，这是一种对称感知的离散最优传输扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，在保持信号结构的同时去除群作用引起的变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的设置中，仅基于原始特征间几何距离的最优传输对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构。

Method: 引入Bispectral Optimal Transport，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示在去除群作用引起的变异的同时保留所有信号结构。

Result: 在经视觉对称性变换的基准数据集上，Bispectral OT计算的传输计划比原始特征OT实现了更高的类别保持准确率。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT能够提高有意义对应的质量，捕捉数据集中潜在的语义标签结构，同时去除不影响类别或内容的干扰变异。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现联邦学习(FL)框架下微调大语言模型(LLMs)仍存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可以从全局模型中提取训练数据，且模型越大泄露越严重。作者提出了针对FL的增强攻击策略，并评估了多种隐私保护技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织通常不愿共享本地数据，联邦学习作为隐私保护框架允许客户端仅共享模型参数进行协作训练。虽然普遍认为FL能保护客户端隐私，但作者发现实际情况并非如此。

Method: 通过大量实验验证FL框架下LLMs的隐私泄露问题，包括使用简单生成方法从全局模型提取训练数据，并提出跟踪全局模型更新的增强攻击策略。同时评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLMs等隐私保护技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击者可以从FL训练的全局模型中提取训练数据，泄露程度随模型规模增大而增加。增强攻击策略能进一步加剧隐私泄露。隐私保护技术能有效降低风险。

Conclusion: FL框架下微调LLMs仍存在显著的隐私泄露风险，需要采用适当的隐私保护措施。研究为在FL中训练LLMs时降低隐私风险提供了有价值的见解和实践指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常通过简单拼接融合配体和蛋白质表示，缺乏显式几何正则化，导致在化学空间和时间上的泛化能力差。

Method: 使用FiLM层条件化分子嵌入到蛋白质嵌入上，通过三重损失强制度量结构，采用RBF回归头在嵌入距离上产生平滑可解释的亲和力预测。

Conclusion: 条件化和度量学习对于稳健的药物-靶点亲和力预测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

TL;DR: 提出CE-GPPO算法，通过保留被裁剪token的梯度信号来控制策略熵，在数学推理任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO方法由于裁剪机制丢弃了低概率token的梯度信号，而这些信号对调节熵动态至关重要。

Method: CE-GPPO算法以温和有界的方式重新引入被裁剪token的梯度，控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，CE-GPPO在不同模型规模下均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，实现探索与利用的平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Conclusion: SynGA作为轻量级且构造上确保可合成性的算法，既可作为强大的独立基准，也可作为未来更大合成感知工作流程中的多功能模块。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

Motivation: 缩放定律是深度学习的显著特征，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数一直难以捉摸，需要从理论上解释这些经验观察。

Method: 使用核回归方法，分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部，推导出超额风险的幂律关系，并在有界可逆变换、多模态混合、有限宽度近似和Transformer架构中验证其普适性。

Result: 发现缩放指数α = 2s/(2s + 1/β)，其中β控制谱尾，1/β衡量冗余度，表明学习曲线斜率取决于数据冗余，更陡的谱会加速规模收益。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其统一为有限样本冗余定律，将经验观察与理论基础联系起来。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

Motivation: 尽管反欺骗系统对保护语音应用安全至关重要，但广泛使用的音频水印（原本用于版权保护）对反欺骗系统的影响尚未被充分研究。

Method: 构建水印增强的训练和评估数据集（Watermark-Spoofing数据集），应用多种手工和神经网络水印方法到现有反欺骗数据集上，并提出知识保持水印学习（KPWL）框架。

Result: 实验表明水印会持续降低反欺骗性能，水印密度越高，等错误率（EER）越高。KPWL框架能让模型适应水印引起的域偏移，同时保持原始域的反欺骗检测能力。

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个被忽视的域偏移因素，本研究为开发抗水印反欺骗系统建立了首个基准。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了Transformer-based表格数据合成工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)的超参数敏感性，发现较浅的模型配置能显著降低计算成本，而REaLTabFormer在大型数据集上能保持更好的数据质量与实用性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based表格数据合成模型虽然数据质量优于GAN和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高，限制了其在普通硬件上的应用。需要研究超参数选择对数据质量和计算性能的影响。

Method: 在两个Transformer-based工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)上评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型配置，从运行时间、机器学习实用性和数据分布相似性三个维度进行敏感性分析，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小型数据集上两种工具都能生成高质量合成数据，但大型数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强实用性和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer配合轻量级LLM提供了最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限度。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上表现出色，但在动态更新时性能下降严重，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS指标。现有方法未能有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强逼近技术：通过局部sigmoid函数逼近数据分布变化，延迟完全重训练；2) 主动更新训练：使用高斯混合模型识别高更新概率区域进行策略性占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上的评估显示，Sig2Model相比最先进的可更新学习索引，重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提升高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的自适应技术有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能瓶颈，为实现实际工作负载中的高效学习索引提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳性，包括趋势变化、不规则季节性和残差。MLP模型在处理长期依赖方面表现优异但忽略局部变化，CNN能有效捕捉局部模式但计算成本高

Method: 提出IConv架构：MLP建模整体趋势，CNN使用多样化核建模细粒度局部模式；独立处理时间依赖通道，通过不同层考虑通道间关系；支持大核尺寸，降低计算成本

Result: 在多个时间序列数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多变量时间序列预测方面具有优越性

Conclusion: 结合MLP和CNN的混合模型能够有效处理时间序列的非平稳特性，IConv架构通过独立通道处理实现了高效准确的预测性能

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW是一种轻量级自适应加权方法，通过三个可学习参数动态调整训练样本的损失权重，根据样本难度（简单、中等、困难）优先处理信息丰富的样本，提升模型在噪声标签和数据异质性下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在噪声标签和数据异质性存在的情况下训练深度神经网络是一个重大挑战，需要一种能够动态适应样本难度的方法来提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数，在每个训练小批量后通过验证集上的单步梯度下降更新样本权重，无需大量超参数调优或干净验证集。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数及架构上的实验表明，LiLAW能持续提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中增强模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，且不严重依赖数据增强或高级正则化。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

TL;DR: 提出了任务依赖初始化(TDI)方法，通过功率谱匹配将状态空间模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特性对齐，显著提高了模型在低数据情况下的泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。状态空间模型等基础序列模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSM的归纳偏置，提出任务依赖初始化(TDI)方法，通过功率谱匹配在大型训练前将模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特性对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著提高了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FERD是首个公平性增强的无数据鲁棒性蒸馏框架，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决鲁棒公平性问题，提升最差类别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据鲁棒性蒸馏方法只关注整体鲁棒性，忽视了不同类别间鲁棒性的严重差异问题，导致鲁棒公平性问题。

Method: 提出FERD框架：1）采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例；2）生成公平感知样本(FAEs)和统一目标对抗样本(UTAEs)来平衡特征表示和攻击目标分布。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性，在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升了15.1%和6.4%。

Conclusion: FERD在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出色，有效解决了无数据鲁棒性蒸馏中的鲁棒公平性问题。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个基于时频表示和去噪扩散的fMRI生成框架，通过将BOLD信号转换为窗口频谱图，使用无分类器扩散模型生成类别条件频谱图，再逆变换回BOLD信号，提升了fMRI数据生成质量和下游脑网络分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本有限，现有生成模型因忽略BOLD信号的非平稳性和非线性动态而表现不佳。

Method: 将BOLD信号通过时变傅里叶变换转换为窗口频谱图，训练无分类器扩散模型生成类别条件频谱图，再通过逆傅里叶变换恢复为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在基于fMRI的脑网络分类任务中展现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架通过结合时频分析和扩散模型，有效解决了fMRI数据生成中的挑战，为数据驱动的脑分析提供了高质量合成数据。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是首个大规模、真实世界的时间序列描述基准，包含46.5万训练和10.5万测试时间戳，整合数值序列、元数据、线图图像和描述文本，并引入新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列描述基准依赖合成数据或过于简化的描述，通常忽略元数据和视觉表示，需要更真实、全面的基准来推动该领域发展。

Method: 从11个不同数据集重构为描述和问答任务，使用可扩展的流水线生成参考描述（大部分由Oracle LLM生成并经过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证），并提供579个人工修订的测试描述。

Result: 建立了可靠且可扩展的基准，对领先的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，揭示了它们的优势和持续局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其描述流水线为时间序列分析与基础模型的交叉研究提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Conclusion: 神经坍缩理论为深度神经网络训练中的后期现象提供了统一的解释框架，类内方差收缩是这些现象的核心机制。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Motivation: 多模态融合中常出现模态竞争问题，某个模态主导学习过程导致其他模态优化不足。现有方法多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1）单模态预训练塑造初始状态；2）引入ECS概念量化模态竞争强度；3）开发FastPID求解器进行部分信息分解，测量模态特异性、冗余性和协同性；4）异步控制器动态平衡模态并定位最佳联合训练起始点。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，证明了塑造预融合模型初始状态是缓解模态竞争的有效策略。

Conclusion: 通过单模态预训练塑造初始状态是一种强大策略，能够在竞争开始前缓解多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，可靠地实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide

integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in

*Armin Karamzade,Kyungmin Kim,JB Lanier,Davide Corsi,Roy Fox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种处理随机传感器延迟的模型强化学习方法，通过基于模型的滤波过程更新信念状态，在延迟环境中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常出现延迟，但标准强化学习算法假设即时感知环境。随机传感器延迟在POMDP中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出基于模型的滤波过程，顺序更新信念状态；引入延迟感知框架，将其整合到模型强化学习中；在Dreamer上应用该框架。

Result: 方法在延迟环境中始终优于为MDP开发的延迟感知基线方法，对部署期间的延迟分布变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 明确建模观测延迟对于处理随机传感器延迟至关重要，提出的方法在模拟机器人任务中优于常见实用启发式方法。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过选择能最好地对齐当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）的活跃客户端，来解决数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，需要改进客户端选择方法来缓解数据不平衡的有害影响。

Method: 扩展现有联邦学习策略，选择活跃客户端以最佳对齐当前标签分布与两个目标分布之一：平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布。

Result: 在三种常见联邦学习策略和两个数据集上的实证验证显示，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐能带来最大改进；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦组合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 分布控制的客户端选择能有效改善联邦学习中的数据不平衡问题，不同目标分布适用于不同类型的失衡情况。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于联邦学习和注意力机制LSTM的脓毒症发病预测模型，支持可变预测窗口，在多中心ICU数据上训练，在保护隐私的同时提升早期检测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症早期准确预测对ICU患者预后至关重要，但单个医院数据有限。联邦学习可跨机构协作训练而不共享数据，解决数据隐私和多样性问题

Method: 使用联邦学习框架，结合注意力增强的LSTM模型，支持可变预测窗口，实现短期和长期预测的统一模型

Result: 联邦学习不仅提高整体预测性能（接近集中式模型），特别有利于早期脓毒症发病预测。可变预测窗口不显著影响性能但降低计算、通信和组织开销

Conclusion: 联邦学习是脓毒症预测的有效方法，特别适合早期检测，可变预测窗口在保持性能的同时减少资源消耗

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为离散扩散模型开发确定性反向过程，替代随机去噪过程，提高生成效率和样本质量。

Method: 使用基于马尔可夫链的确定性去噪算法，引入具有弱混沌动态的放牧算法变体来实现确定性离散状态转换。

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务中，效率和样本质量均得到一致提升。

Conclusion: 这种简单的去随机化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，并证明确定性反向过程在离散状态空间中也同样有效。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

TL;DR: 开发了一个深度学习框架，结合微观流动性特征、历史犯罪和社会人口统计数据，在精细时空分辨率下提升犯罪预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在精细时空分辨率下，结合微观流动性特征是否能增强犯罪预测的准确性，超越传统仅使用历史犯罪和社会人口数据的方法。

Method: 使用ConvLSTM网络，结合犯罪事件数据、社会人口调查数据和人类流动性数据，在四个美国城市进行训练和预测，并与逻辑回归、随机森林和标准LSTM等基线模型比较。

Result: 结合流动性特征显著提升了预测性能，特别是在使用较短输入序列时。同时使用流动性和社会人口特征时效果最佳，深度学习模型在所有四个城市都取得了最高的召回率、精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究强调了整合多样化数据源（包括流动性数据）对于时空犯罪预测的重要性，同时也凸显了深度学习在精细时空尺度处理中的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高重型土方设备中线性执行器的能效，减少能量损失和环境影响。

Method: 使用MATLAB/Simulink进行液压回路仿真，比较PDCV和PFCV两种方案。PFCV通过在执行器两端之间引入人工泄漏来减少能量损失。位置控制采用模糊控制器调谐的PID控制器。

Result: PFCV液压回路比传统PDCV回路能效提高8.5%，通过旁路泵的多余流量减少热量形式的能量损失。

Conclusion: 提出的PFCV方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，降低环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不真实或不直观，需要一种能够产生更真实和用户可理解的反事实的方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，整合了对比学习和分类一致性目标、基于原型的初始化以及真实性约束优化。

Result: 在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据上，GenFacts在真实性方面比现有基准方法提高了18.7%，在人类研究中获得了最高的可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据，真实性和用户中心的可解释性（而不仅仅是稀疏性）是产生可操作反事实解释的关键因素。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

TL;DR: Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳甚至不如简单线性模型，研究发现现有时间序列Transformer中的注意力机制实际上退化成了简单MLP，原因是当前的嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳，甚至在某些情况下不如简单线性基线，探究注意力机制失效的原因。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，逐步将Transformer修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；设计了可解释的数据集来研究注意力机制失效的原因；进行了理论分析。

Result: 发现Transformer块在现有时间序列Transformer中经常退化成为简单MLP；注意力机制没有按预期方式工作；当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。

Conclusion: Transformer在时间序列预测中的失败主要是由于当前嵌入方法的局限性，导致注意力机制无法有效工作，使得模型退化成了简单的MLP结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了解耦值注意力（DVA）来改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs），使其在高维回归任务中更有效，通过分离输入相似性计算和标签传播来模拟高斯过程更新，在保持快速推理的同时显著降低验证损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中对高维回归任务效果有限，需要改进注意力机制来更好地模拟高斯过程特性，同时保持PFNs的快速推理优势。

Method: 引入解耦值注意力（DVA），仅从输入计算相似性，通过值单独传播标签，实现核自由的高斯过程式更新。验证了局部注意力在PFNs中的重要性。

Result: 在5维和10维情况下验证损失降低超过50%，CNN-based PFNs性能与Transformer-based相当，64维电力流方程近似平均绝对误差达1E-3量级，比精确GP推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: 注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素，局部注意力能显著提升PFNs性能，DVA方法成功模拟了高斯过程更新机制。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

TL;DR: Flow matching在低噪声区域存在不稳定性问题，本文提出Local Contrastive Flow (LCF)方法，通过在小噪声级别使用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现flow matching框架在低噪声区域存在根本性不稳定性，当噪声水平接近零时，输入的微小扰动会导致速度目标的巨大变化，影响优化和语义表示质量。

Method: 提出LCF混合训练协议，在小噪声级别使用对比特征对齐，在中等和高噪声级别保留标准flow matching。

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量。

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理对于充分发挥flow matching在生成和表示学习中的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习具有巨大潜力，但视图间结构异质性阻碍有效融合，特别是自监督方法如掩码建模，交叉视图上下文被视为噪声

Method: 提出MixGate框架，采用原则性训练课程：首先通过等价对齐损失教授模型共享的功能感知表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标

Result: 广泛的实验和关键消融研究表明，对齐优先策略将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督学习的关键前提条件，能够解锁多视图布尔电路学习的潜力

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Motivation: 个性化医疗需要为患者找到最优治疗方案，但无法随意测试候选治疗，而现有的替代模型难以泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合。

Method: 通过'提示优化'实现，将LLMs作为随机引擎提出治疗设计，利用其上下文理解非结构化领域知识的能力。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务上的实验表明，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON提供了一种数学上严谨的方法，能够有效利用领域特定先验知识来优化个性化治疗计划。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Motivation: 现有基于定位的方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠组，导致灾难性过度遗忘或目标知识不完全擦除。

Result: 与现有定位方法相比，CLUE通过精确的神经定位实现了更优的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过区分遗忘和保留电路，解决了现有方法中神经元纠缠的问题，实现了更精确的LLM遗忘。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的模块，具有显著的通用性和有效性，能够持续提升各种GNN在图级异常检测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

TL;DR: LCR是一个实用的基于学习的GPU缓存框架，通过LARU算法结合机器学习预测来增强LRU缓存策略，在预测准确时达到接近最优性能，预测不准确时优雅退化到接近LRU性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中，缓存效率是主要瓶颈。推荐模型中的嵌入命中率和大型语言模型中的KV缓存未命中严重影响性能。启发式策略如LRU在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而现有学习方法存在预测不准确时性能急剧下降或设计保守收益有限的问题。

Method: 提出LCR框架，核心算法LARU通过机器学习预测增强LRU缓存策略，并通过在线错误估计动态适应预测准确性。在预测准确时实现接近最优性能，预测不准确时优雅退化到LRU性能。

Result: 在DLRM和LLM场景下，LCR将吞吐量提升高达24.2%，P99 TTFT降低高达28.3%，优于广泛使用的推理系统。即使在预测不佳的情况下，性能仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存中弥合了实证进展与理论进展之间的差距，提供了性能增益同时确保鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

*Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在截断伊辛模型中基于单个样本估计逆温度参数β的方法，使用伪似然最大化技术，在近乎线性时间内实现了参数的一致性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在截断伊辛模型中，传统方法需要多个样本来估计参数，而本文旨在解决仅使用单个样本进行参数估计的挑战性问题。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化方法，扩展了Daskalakis等人和Galanis等人的技术，处理截断伊辛模型的复杂设置，在近乎O(n)时间内构建估计器。

Result: 设计的估计器在k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³条件下，与真实参数β*具有O(Δ³/√n)的一致性，其中Δ是图的度限制。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将伪似然最大化技术扩展到截断伊辛模型，实现了在单个样本下的参数一致性估计，为高维统计推断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Brian M. Kurkoski,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为二元自编码器(BAE)的新方法，通过最小化小批量隐藏激活的熵来增强LLM特征提取的稀疏性和独立性，解决了现有方法产生密集特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从LLM隐藏状态中提取原子化数值特征时，通常依赖带有隐式正则化的自编码器，缺乏对实例间全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致产生大量密集特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化程度。

Method: 提出二元自编码器(BAE)，通过在小批量隐藏激活上施加最小熵约束来促进特征独立性和稀疏性。使用阶跃函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，并应用梯度估计实现反向传播。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠方面表现优异：能够可靠估计二元隐藏激活的熵来表征LLM推理动态；在特征提取中避免密集特征，产生最多可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有有效性，能够避免密集特征并产生大量可解释特征，同时改进了传统特征解释方法对数值标记的处理。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

*Qingyu Han,Qian Li,Linxin Yang,Qian Chen,Qingjiang Shi,Ruoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Local-UID方案和ColorGNN方法，通过局部唯一标识符解决ILP优化中GNN表达能力和泛化能力的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准匿名GNN在ILP优化中表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符(UID)会引入虚假相关性严重损害泛化能力，需要解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 基于d跳唯一性着色的局部UID方案，确保标识符仅在节点的d跳邻域内唯一；在此基础上提出ColorGNN（通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息）和轻量级变体ColorUID。

Result: 实验表明：(i)在三个ILP基准上取得显著提升；(ii)在线性规划数据集上表现出强大的OOD泛化能力；(iii)与最先进方法结合时进一步改进图级任务。

Conclusion: 对于d层网络，Local-UID在实现Global-UID表达能力的同时提供更强的泛化能力，有效解决了ILP优化中GNN的表达能力-泛化权衡问题。

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用无损压缩作为评估时间序列模型的新范式，基于香农信源编码定理，建立了最优压缩长度与负对数似然的直接等价关系，为建模能力提供了严格统一的信息论标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注四个典型任务（预测、插补、异常检测、分类），这些任务主要评估特定任务性能，无法严格衡量模型是否捕获了数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 定义了标准化评估协议和指标，提出并开源了TSCom-Bench评估框架，能够快速将时间序列模型适配为无损压缩的骨干网络。

Result: 在多样化数据集上对包括TimeXer、iTransformer和PatchTST在内的最先进模型进行实验，证明压缩能够揭示经典基准测试忽略的分布性弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有的时间序列建模评估方法。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

TL;DR: 提出MAIFormer多智能体倒置Transformer架构，用于预测多飞机飞行轨迹，通过掩码多元注意力捕获个体时空模式，通过智能体注意力建模复杂空中交通场景中的社会模式，在真实数据集上表现最佳且具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对理解空中交通流至关重要，但面临建模个体行为与复杂交互的挑战，且需要生成可解释的预测结果。

Method: 提出MAIFormer架构，包含两个关键注意力模块：掩码多元注意力（捕获个体飞机的时空模式）和智能体注意力（建模多智能体间的社会模式）。

Result: 在仁川国际机场终端空域的真实ADS-B飞行轨迹数据集上评估，MAIFormer在多个指标上达到最佳性能，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MAIFormer不仅预测性能优越，还能从人类视角产生可解释的预测结果，提高了模型的透明度和在空管中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

TL;DR: ExMoIRL是一个新颖的生成框架，通过整合表型和靶点特异性线索来生成新分子，解决了当前AI驱动药物设计中高质量候选分子生成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于表型和基于靶点的策略各有局限性，要么实验成本高，要么忽视系统级细胞反应。需要一种能够结合两者优势的方法来改进药物设计。

Method: 使用表型引导的生成器，先在广泛的药物诱导转录谱上进行预训练，然后通过多目标强化学习进行微调。奖励函数融合对接亲和力、药物相似性评分，并加入排序损失、先验似然正则化和熵最大化。

Result: 实验表明ExMoIRL在多个明确靶点上优于最先进的表型和靶点模型。生成的分子具有良好的药物样性质、高靶点亲和力和对癌细胞的抑制效力（IC50）。

Conclusion: 这个统一框架展示了结合表型引导和靶点感知策略的协同潜力，为从头药物发现提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究上下文学习机制，发现语言模型在零样本场景下生成非选择性表示，而少样本上下文学习通过选择性移除冗余信息来引导模型专注于目标任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习作为一种新兴的少样本学习范式，其内部机制尚不明确，本文旨在通过信息移除的视角揭示其工作原理。

Method: 通过测量隐藏状态在精心设计的指标上的表现，观察少样本上下文学习如何模拟任务导向的信息移除过程，并识别出诱导移除操作的关键注意力头（去噪头）。

Result: 研究发现选择性移除隐藏状态中的特定信息能有效引导语言模型专注于目标任务，而去噪头的移除会导致上下文学习准确率显著下降，特别是在正确标签缺失的情况下。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是上下文学习的关键机制，去噪头在选择性移除冗余信息中起着关键作用，这为理解上下文学习的内在机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

TL;DR: rBridge方法使用小模型（≤1B参数）有效预测大模型推理能力，通过结合预训练目标和任务对齐来加权负对数似然，大幅降低数据集筛选成本100倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型成本高昂，需要用小代理模型优化数据集，但推理能力通常只在超过7B参数的大模型中可靠出现，小模型难以预测大模型推理表现。

Method: rBridge通过加权负对数似然结合任务对齐，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，使小代理模型能更准确地预测大模型的推理能力。

Result: rBridge在1B到32B规模上实现最强相关性，数据集排名成本降低100倍以上，并在1B到7B规模上实现跨预训练数据集的零样本迁移预测关系。

Conclusion: rBridge为以更低成本探索推理导向的预训练提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs是否能够真正学习和泛化新的推理策略（而不仅仅是预训练中已掌握的技能）这一开放性问题。

Method: 使用DELTA-Code基准测试，通过模板化问题生成器隔离推理技能，引入完全分布外的问题家族，探索强化学习训练中的关键要素如分阶段热身、经验回放、课程训练等。

Result: 实验揭示了顿悟相变现象：在长时间接近零奖励后，RL训练模型突然达到接近完美的准确率；在家族内部和技能重组方面表现良好，但在转换性案例中仍存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA提供了一个清晰的测试平台，用于探索RL驱动推理的极限，并理解模型如何超越现有先验来获取新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT)框架，通过数据分区和p值聚合的方法显著降低条件独立性测试的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于约束的因果发现需要大量条件独立性测试，但计算成本过高，特别是当样本量很大时，这严重限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用分而治之策略：将数据分成子集，在每个子集上独立应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合得到的p值。

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性级别，在保持竞争性能的同时显著减少了计算负担，特别是在复杂测试场景和真实世界数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: E-CIT是一个通用即插即用框架，能有效解决因果发现中条件独立性测试的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA)框架，消除显式actor网络，直接从噪声级critic的梯度场生成动作，简化训练同时保持策略表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖分离的actor和critic网络，训练复杂且对架构决策敏感；扩散模型虽能表达多模态行为但引入额外设计负担。需要更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: ACA框架消除显式actor网络，通过噪声级critic的梯度场直接生成动作，保持策略改进与critic最新价值估计紧密对齐。

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic和最先进扩散方法，实现了更优的学习曲线和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACA提供了一个简单而强大的在线RL解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达能力，无需扩散actor即可捕获多样化多模态行为。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中视觉越狱攻击的局限性，发现现有攻击方法在跨模型迁移时效果不佳。通过分析损失景观和特征表示，作者提出了FORCE方法，通过纠正对特定层特征和频率特征的过度依赖，提高了视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型集成新模态增强了能力，但也引入了额外漏洞。现有的简单视觉越狱攻击虽然能有效操纵开源MLLMs，但在跨模型迁移到闭源MLLMs时效果有限，无法可靠识别漏洞。

Method: 分析越狱攻击的损失景观，发现攻击倾向于位于高锐度区域；分析中间层和频谱域的特征表示，揭示了对狭窄层表示和语义贫乏频率组件的过度依赖。提出FORCE方法，引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，并根据语义内容重新缩放频率特征的影响。

Result: 通过消除对层和频谱特征的非泛化依赖，FORCE方法为视觉越狱攻击发现了平坦的可行区域，从而提高了跨模型迁移性。大量实验证明该方法能有效促进对闭源MLLMs的视觉红队评估。

Conclusion: FORCE方法通过纠正特征过度依赖问题，显著提升了视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移能力，为评估闭源多模态大语言模型的安全性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究通过边缘归因修补分析发现，RL微调通过增加激活强度和多样性来增强LLM能力，而DPO方法的效果较弱且不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RL微调为何能超越SFT提升LLM能力的内在机制，以及不同RL方法对模型内部结构的影响差异。

Method: 使用边缘归因修补技术分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部差异，比较PPO、GRPO和DPO等不同RL方法的效果。

Result: 发现在线RL后训练产生两个稳健效应：激活强度整体增加，激活模式多样性提高；DPO方法的变化较弱且不一致。

Conclusion: RL微调通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性来提升泛化能力，在线RL与基于偏好的方法存在显著方法学差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Motivation: 研究如何构建高效的学习系统，即在最短时间内达到期望误差阈值的学习系统。

Method: 基于物理学中的最小作用量原理，提出学习拉格朗日量概念，将学习过程视为在拉格朗日量中寻找平稳路径的搜索过程。

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning
$\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths
in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

Motivation: 几何问题求解需要准确的图表理解和跨模态对齐能力，但目前缺乏专门评估几何元素定位和解释能力的方法。

Method: 构建GeoRef数据集，使用结构化几何形式语言生成大规模合成训练数据，采用SFT和GRPO两种微调方法，并提出验证-再生机制。

Conclusion: 几何指代表达理解是几何问题求解的重要基础，GeoRef训练能提升下游几何推理任务的性能。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Motivation: 开发高效的多目标优化方法来计算冲突目标之间的帕累托最优解集仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是对于大规模和昂贵的问题。

Method: SPREAD首先学习决策空间采样点的条件扩散过程，然后在每个反向扩散步骤中，通过使用自适应多梯度下降启发的更新进行快速收敛，同时使用基于高斯RBF的排斥项来保持多样性。

Result: 在多目标优化基准测试（包括离线和基于贝叶斯代理的设置）上的实证结果表明，SPREAD在效率、可扩展性和帕累托前沿覆盖方面匹配或超过了领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: SPREAD是一个有效的多目标优化生成框架，能够在大规模和昂贵问题上实现良好的帕累托前沿覆盖。

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

TL;DR: SATMC是一个新颖的图域自适应框架，通过图结构和属性转换来顺序对齐不同网络间的分布，解决了传统方法在处理结构异质性时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图域自适应方法主要关注节点属性转换和特征分布对齐，但往往难以处理不同图域之间的结构异质性，导致分布对齐效果不佳。

Method: SATMC框架通过图结构和属性转换顺序对齐分布，引入私有域信息减少机制和经验Wasserstein距离来增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在9对公开跨域数据集上的实验表明，SATMC在跨网络节点分类任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SATMC能够实现比现有图域自适应方法更紧的跨网络节点分类误差界，有效解决了结构异质性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个用于大规模生成困难数学问题的有效流水线，通过自适应思维模型识别现有数据集中的难题，然后训练专门的难题生成器，显著提升了推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展数学问题生成方面面临高计算成本、复杂提示工程和生成问题难度有限等挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用自适应思维模型通过单次前向传播识别困难问题，然后训练专门的难题生成器(DiffGen-8B)来大规模生成新难题，无需复杂的逐实例提示。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct，相比原始数据集性能提升11.3%，在多个数学竞赛基准上达到65.9%的平均准确率，超越了OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff证明了无需依赖大型昂贵教师模型即可有效传递高级推理能力，并观察到随着困难问题数量增加，模型在困难基准上的性能呈现明显的扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种混合注意力计算方法，结合了naive和absorb两种实现方式的优势，在MLA架构中实现了高达3倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLA解码内核使用absorb方法虽然减少了HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性无法充分利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀），限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出TyphoonMLA混合方法，对注意力计算的计算密集型部分使用naive公式，对非共享部分使用absorb公式以减少带宽需求。

Result: 在NPU和GPU上分别实现了高达3倍和3.24倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升，HBM大小仅增加3%的开销。

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA通过巧妙结合两种实现方式的优势，有效解决了MLA架构中注意力计算的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

TL;DR: GraphUniverse是一个用于生成图家族以系统评估归纳泛化能力的框架，通过创建具有持久语义社区的图来测试模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图学习基准局限于单图、直推式设置，无法系统评估模型在新图上的归纳泛化能力，需要开发能够生成图家族以测试分布偏移鲁棒性的框架。

Method: 开发GraphUniverse框架，生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，通过控制同质性、度分布等结构属性来创建概念一致但结构多样的图。

Result: 基准测试显示，强直推性能不能预测归纳泛化能力，对分布偏移的鲁棒性高度依赖于模型架构选择和初始图状态（如同质性高低）。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发真正可泛化的图架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at
https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

TL;DR: VARL是一个利用视觉语言模型为强化学习代理提供动作建议的框架，通过增加样本多样性来提高稀疏奖励任务中的样本效率，而不改变最优性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中需要大量交互步骤，而视觉语言动作策略在低层控制方面表现有限，通常需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，确保最优性和收敛性不变。

Result: VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销，在多样化环境和代理设置中均表现良好。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在真实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自进化的认知代理框架，通过构建统一的异质邮件图，结合认知图神经网络和LLM进行上下文感知推理，并通过红蓝对抗循环实现持续进化，显著提升了垃圾邮件和钓鱼邮件的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越简单的关键词黑名单或启发式方法，采用多模态策略结合文本、URL、附件等，传统基于静态规则或单模态模型的检测系统难以整合异质信号并持续适应，导致性能快速下降。

Method: 构建统一的异质邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用认知图神经网络增强LLM进行上下文感知推理；建立对抗自进化循环，红队生成新规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集（Enron-Spam、Ling-Spam、SpamAssassin、TREC）和合成对抗变体上的广泛实验表明，EvoMail在检测准确性、对演化垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理可解释性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色但容易受到对抗性攻击，需要寻找简单有效的数据适应防御方法。

Method: 使用线性降维方法，比较标准PCA和稀疏PCA(SPCA)作为前端特征提取器，结合理论分析推导鲁棒性证书，并通过实验验证在非线性网络中的效果。

Result: 理论分析表明稀疏投影能减少对抗性攻击的利用空间，实验结果显示SPCA在强白盒和黑盒攻击下比PCA表现更好，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 稀疏主成分分析通过减少投影的稀疏性来降低对抗性攻击的有效性，这一机制在理论和实验中都得到了验证，为对抗性防御提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型难以解释，特别是当输出是多维潜在嵌入而非明确目标时。现有解释方法要么过于细粒度，要么过于简化，无法有效揭示潜在空间的组织结构。

Method: 将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过原始特征的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后在整个潜在空间中揭示重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 在MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入上，LAVA能够捕捉相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域中发现视觉和生物学相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA提供了一种有效的方法来解释无监督学习中的局部嵌入组织，通过特征相关性模式揭示了潜在空间的结构关系。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM分词器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉CAD原语级语义，阻碍了几何结构建模。需要与CAD结构特性对齐的多模态分词策略。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，使用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原语级池化和约束解码，生成紧凑的、原语感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: 在统一文本引导CAD原型设计中，CAD-Tokenizer显著改善了指令遵循和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上都优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: 多模态分词策略能够提供更有效的CAD表示，为文本引导CAD原型设计提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

Result: 实验表明λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现更好，达到峰值性能更快，且训练时间和成本影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 研究质疑了使用昂贵显式定义PRM的必要性，证明可以利用GRPO算法中隐藏的PRM结构来提升性能，为RL训练提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DATS方法，通过原型距离估计和距离感知校准来改进持续学习中的不确定性校准，无需任务信息即可自适应调整温度参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要从数据角度解决校准问题，使用单一温度参数忽略了任务间差异，导致不同任务的校准误差波动较大。在安全关键应用中，模型不仅需要预测性能，还需要可靠的不确定性校准。

Method: 提出距离感知温度缩放(DATS)，结合原型距离估计和距离感知校准，推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度，无需先验任务信息。

Result: 在标准基准和生物医学领域的不平衡数据集上，DATS方法相比最先进方法在减少任务间校准误差方面表现稳定、可靠且一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放有效解决了持续学习中任务间校准误差波动的问题，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的不确定性校准方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: MoT是一种在异构专家模型间进行潜在层协作的方法，通过轻量级路由器选择专家，在共享潜在空间中进行交叉注意力，实现单次推理的高效多模型协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型日益专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交换聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性。

Method: 使用轻量级路由器选择top-K专家并指定主专家，通过交互层将隐藏状态投影到共享潜在空间，主专家对活跃同行进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，仅训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT超越了当前最先进的Avengers方法，分别提升+0.38%和+2.92%，显著优于最佳单模型，且具有单次推理、运行时与路由基线相当的优势。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制来组合异构LLM，是迈向更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差，但这种方法只是f-散度的一个特例，需要更灵活的框架来平衡遗忘强度与概念保留

Result: 展示了不同f-散度在概念遗忘中的不同特性，提供了在激进遗忘与概念保留之间的灵活权衡机制

Conclusion: f-散度框架为扩散模型机器遗忘提供了更通用和灵活的方法，能够根据具体应用需求优化遗忘效果

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的逆强化学习方法，将最大熵IRL简化为两个现成的监督学习问题：概率分类来估计行为策略，以及迭代回归来解决固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的逆强化学习方法涉及复杂的内循环优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，这限制了现代高度表达性函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。本文旨在简化IRL流程，使其更易实现。

Method: 将softmax IRL转化为两个监督学习任务：1）使用概率分类估计行为策略；2）使用迭代回归求解固定点方程。该方法简单、模块化，适用于各种函数逼近器。

Result: 提供了最优解的精确特征描述、基于oracle的通用算法、有限样本误差界限，以及实证结果，显示该方法在性能上可与MaxEnt IRL竞争甚至更优。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了逆强化学习流程，使其更易于实现和使用现代函数逼近器，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TimeRCD，一种基于相对上下文差异(RCD)预训练范式的时间序列异常检测基础模型，通过检测相邻时间窗口间的显著差异来识别异常，在零样本检测中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重构的时间序列异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常，同时容易误判复杂正常模式，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 采用相对上下文差异(RCD)预训练范式，训练模型检测相邻时间窗口间的显著差异而非重构输入；使用标准Transformer架构；构建大规模合成语料库进行预训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时间序列异常检测中显著优于现有的通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式验证了其优越性，为构建鲁棒且可泛化的时间序列异常检测基础模型开辟了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Conclusion: DINO为物理一致的长期湍流预测建立了新基准，具有卓越的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO通过树搜索和分组相对优势估计有效解决了强化学习中的稀疏监督问题，理论分析表明其目标等价于步骤级直接偏好学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在分布式数据上本地训练生成模型而无需集中聚合。

Method: 开发了三种联邦流匹配方法：FFM-vanilla（本地独立耦合）、FFM-LOT（本地最优传输耦合）和FFM-GOT（基于半对偶最优传输的全局协调耦合）。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功解决了分布式数据下的隐私保护生成模型训练问题，通过全局协调机制在保持隐私的同时实现了良好的性能。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance

Abstract: There has been a considerable interest in constrained training of deep neural
networks (DNNs) recently for applications such as fairness and safety. Several
toolkits have been proposed for this task, yet there is still no industry
standard. We present humancompatible.train
(https://github.com/humancompatible/train), an easily-extendable PyTorch-based
Python package for training DNNs with stochastic constraints. We implement
multiple previously unimplemented algorithms for stochastically constrained
stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the toolkit use by comparing two
algorithms on a deep learning task with fairness constraints.

*Junxin Lu,Shiliang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AirPCM是一个新颖的深度时空预测模型，通过整合多区域多污染物动态与显式气象-污染物因果关系建模，实现准确可扩展的空气污染预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球性紧迫问题，威胁公众健康和环境可持续性。现有方法局限于单一污染物或局部区域，难以处理复杂的多污染物相互作用、变化的气象条件和区域空间异质性。

Method: 采用统一架构联合捕捉跨站点空间相关性、时间自相关性和气象-污染物动态因果关系，实现细粒度可解释的多污染物预测。

Result: 在多尺度真实数据集上的广泛评估表明，AirPCM在预测准确性和泛化能力上持续超越最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AirPCM的长期预测能力为未来空气质量趋势和潜在高风险窗口提供可行见解，为基于证据的环境治理和碳减排规划提供及时支持。

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SuperOffload系统，针对Superchips异构架构优化LLM训练，通过自适应权重卸载等技术实现2.5倍吞吐量提升，支持在单个Superchip上训练25B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superchips将GPU和CPU紧密集成在同一封装中，提供了前所未有的计算能力，但现有研究很少探讨LLM训练如何从这种新架构中受益，需要重新审视卸载策略的假设。

Method: SuperOffload系统结合自适应权重卸载、桶化重新分区、Superchip感知类型转换、推测执行等技术，并针对Grace CPU优化Adam优化器，充分利用Hopper GPU、Grace CPU和NVLink-C2C互连。

Result: 在NVIDIA GH200上的评估显示，相比最先进的基于卸载的系统，SuperOffload实现了2.5倍的吞吐量提升，支持在单个Superchip上训练25B模型，并在8个GH200上训练13B模型时达到55%的模型FLOPs利用率。

Conclusion: SuperOffload证明了Superchip架构在LLM训练中的巨大潜力，通过专门优化的卸载策略能够显著提升训练效率，支持更大模型的训练。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PSPO方法替代强化学习中的比率裁剪，通过平滑策略概率来稳定训练，在保持梯度信号的同时避免大更新，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法如PPO和GRPO使用比率裁剪来稳定训练，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。

Method: 提出概率平滑策略优化(PSPO)，在计算重要性比率前将当前策略概率平滑到旧策略，类似于标签平滑，创建软信任区域。

Result: 在GSM8K上，GR-PSPO相比裁剪GRPO显著提升性能：0.5B模型从17.6%提升到39.7%，1.5B模型从37.8%提升到59.4%。

Conclusion: PSPO在保持稳定性的同时保留梯度信号，比传统裁剪方法更有效，能产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理结果。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

### [247] [Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293)
*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于在广义线性模型下计算最优鲁棒补救措施，使用L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）来约束模型变化，相比之前使用L^∞范数的方法显著降低了补救成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒补救方法使用L^∞范数衡量模型变化，可能导致补救成本过高。本文旨在通过使用更约束的L^p范数来解决这个问题，提供成本更低的鲁棒补救方案。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，在L^p范数约束下为广义线性模型提供可证明的最优鲁棒补救。该方法通过更精确地建模模型变化来提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，对于线性和非线性模型，新算法相比先前工作显著降低了补救成本（可达几个数量级），在补救实施成本和有效性之间实现了更好的权衡，并提供更稀疏的补救方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于L^p范数的鲁棒补救算法在降低补救成本、提高稀疏性和保持对后处理方法的鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了神经网络训练数据重构攻击的固有局限性，证明了在没有先验知识的情况下存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解，重构本质上不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络记忆训练数据引发隐私安全担忧，现有重构攻击方法缺乏可靠理论基础，需要分析其固有弱点和失效条件。

Method: 从理论角度严格证明重构攻击的局限性，并通过实证验证训练样本精确复现的偶然性。

Result: 证明无先验知识时存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解；发现训练更充分的网络反而更不易受重构攻击。

Conclusion: 重构攻击本质上不可靠，训练更充分的网络在满足隐式偏置条件的同时反而增强了隐私保护，调和了泛化能力与隐私保护的需求。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.
