It is widely recognized that achieving\nhuman-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to\nintegrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy\ngeneration, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving\nhigh-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),\npretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,\nexhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a\nsingle function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without\nintegrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose\nFrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that\nachieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our\nframework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions\nfrom frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional\ncompleteness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy\ngeneration, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,\ncerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and\ndesign efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules.

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly\navailable bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its\nsuperiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories."}

Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the\nvisual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,\nincluding Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade\nperformance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,\nunderscoring the importance of visual input design over purely\nlinguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual\nstructuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving\ncompositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for\nenhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks."}

To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view\nin single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is\nrequired by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two\nstages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating\nboth the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the\ndissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and\nobserved intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view\ntraining loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly\nenforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is\nperformed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage.

To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines\nASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually\nrelevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with\nstrengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric\nspecifically designed for assessing generative performance.

Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even\nstate-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically\nequivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work\naddresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale\nfine-tuning on curated datasets.

Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and\napplicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we\nenforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a\nCross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across\nsemantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that\ndraws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and\nleverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.\nExperiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial\ngains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new\ndirection for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning."}

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge.
